The headrest in a car is meant to cushion the human head and neck during a collision. The connection between the neck and the skull (shown here as point [`B`]) is a particularly vulnerable spot. 
During a collision, the force distribution when the head hits the headrest looks like [`w(x)=C+Dx^2`] where [`C`] and [`D`] are unknown. 
If [`d_1`] is [`[$d1]\:meters`], and the resultant force is equal to [`[$Fr]\:N`] and is located at [`x=[$X]\:m`], what are [`C`] and [`D`]?

[`w(x) = `][_____]{"$C"}[`+`][_____]{"$D"}[`x^2`]
