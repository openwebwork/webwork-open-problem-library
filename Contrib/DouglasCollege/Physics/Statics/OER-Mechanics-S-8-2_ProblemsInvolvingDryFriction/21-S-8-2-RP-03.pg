Justin and his trusty steed Herman the Horse are on their way to a friend's house in the snowy forest. Due to his nervousness, Justin decides to rest at the bottom of the snowy hill. If the static coefficient of friction between the sleigh and the snow is [`[$mu_s]`], and Justin and Herman have masses of [`[$m_J] \: \textrm{kg}`] and [`[$m_H] \: \textrm{kg}`] respectively, find the minimum and maximum pull force [`P`] that Herman can exert on the sleigh to keep if from sliding. Assume that the sleigh has a mass of [`[$m_s] \: \textrm{kg}`] and that the slope has an angle [`\theta = [$thetaDeg]^\circ`].

[`P_{min} =`] [___]{"$P_min"} [`\: \textrm{N}`]

[`P_{max} =`] [___]{"$P_max"} [`\: \textrm{N}`]


After a while, Herman suddenly jerks forward and starts pulling the sleigh with greater force in order to bring Justin to his friend and her horse. In order to keep Justin from getting dizzy or messing up his clothes, Herman pulls the sleigh such that they travel at a constant speed of [`[$s] \: \textrm{m/s}`]. If the kinetic coefficient of friction between the sleigh and the snow is [`[$mu_k]`], find the pull force [`P`] that Herman exerts on the sleigh.

[`P =`] [___]{"$P"} [`\: \textrm{N}`]
