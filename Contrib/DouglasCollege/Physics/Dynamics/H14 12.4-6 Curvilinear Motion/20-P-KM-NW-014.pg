BEGIN_PGML

A particle starts from rest at the origin with the ability to move horizontally and vertically. Starting at [`t = 0`] seconds, the particle accelerates horizontally in such a way that its velocity (in metres per second) is equal to time [`t`]. If the particle's vertical height (in metres) is also equal to time [`t`], how much faster is it moving at [`t = [$time2]`] [`s`] compared to when [`t = [$time1]`] [`s`]? How much further is it away from its starting location?

[`\Delta v =`][___]{"$velocityDifference"}[`m/s`]  
[`\Delta s =`][___]{"$distanceDifference"}[`m`]
