What would be the final velocity of both the mammoths immediately after the collision?
Assume this is a perfectly inelastic collision - that means they collide and stick together
after the collision. Mammoth A has a mass [`m_A = [$massA] kg`] and was heading to othe right
at [`v_A = [$velA] m/s`]. Mammoth B has a mass [`m_B = [$massB] kg`] and was leading to the
left at [`v_B = [$velB] m/s`] before the collision.

Assume to the right is positive.

[`v_{final} =`] [____]{"$ansA"} [`m/s`]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Answers

[`P_{initial} = m_Av_A + m_Bv_B`]

[`P_{final} = (m_A + m_B)v_f`]

By the law of conservation of momentum:

[`P_{initial}=P_{final}`]

From which we can obtain:

[`v_{f}=\frac{m_Av_A + m_Bv_B}{m_A+m_B}`]

Note that the value used for [`v_B`] should be negative if moving to the right is taken as positive.
