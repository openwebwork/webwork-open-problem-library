An adventurer, travelling by sea to their distant home, dozes off and begins to dream about the [`[$weight] kg`] Magnificent Treasure they almost stole from the Deep Dark Dungeon. The adventurer remembers tying a rope around the treasure chest containing the Magnificent Treasure and pulling on it so that the rope was constantly at [`[$thetad]`] degrees above the horizontal. They pulled with a force of [`F=[$A]t^2`] Newtons. If the coefficient of static friction was [`[$friction]`], at what time did the adventurer manage to make the treasure move?

_Do not consider if it tips first_

[`t = `][_____]{"$time"}[`seconds`]
