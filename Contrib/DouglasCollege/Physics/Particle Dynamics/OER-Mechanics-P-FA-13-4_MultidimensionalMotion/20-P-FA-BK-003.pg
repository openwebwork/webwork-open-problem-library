Three blocks are stacked on top of each other, as in the image above. 
From top to bottom, the blocks have masses of [`1kg`], [`2kg`], and [`3kg`].
A force [`P`] is applied to the middle block. As the force increases, three things happen, in this order.
First, at a certain force, all three blocks begin to slide across the ground.
Next, at a higher force, block B begins to slide against block C.
Finally, at an even higher force, block A begins to slide against block B. 
The friction coefficients are as follows.  
Static friction between block C and the ground: [`\mu_{SG} = [$musg]`]  
Kinetic friction between block C and the ground: [`\mu_{KG} = [$mukg]`]  
Static friction between two blocks: [`\mu_{SB} = [$musb]`]  
Kinetic friction between two blocks: [`\mu_{KB} = [$mukb]`]  

Neglect air drag, assume the only forces acting on the blocks are 
gravity ([`9.81m/s^2`]), friction ([`F_F = \mu*N`]) and [`P`]. Also assume that the blocks remain stacked
(i.e., when A begins sliding against B, B is still sliding against C).

Find the three minimum values for applied force [`P`] to cause the three types of motion described above.

C begins to slide against ground at [`P_1=`] [______]{"$P1"} [`N`]

B begins to slide against C at [`P_2=`] [______]{"$P2"} [`N`]

A begins to slide against B at [`P_3=`] [______]{"$P3"} [`N`]
