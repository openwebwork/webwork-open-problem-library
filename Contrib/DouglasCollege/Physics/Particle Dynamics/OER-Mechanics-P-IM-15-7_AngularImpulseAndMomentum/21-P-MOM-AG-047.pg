A tradesperson is working on a new piece that requires the use of a grindstone. The grindstone is very high-end can be considered frictionless (if no force is applied, it will continue to turn at a constant speed indefinitely). 
Since it is operated by hand and inexplicably does not have a braking mechanism, you need to apply a slowing force yourself using a scrap piece. 
If the grindstone took [`[$T]\:seconds`] to slow down from [`[$vi]\:\frac{rad}{s}`] to [`[$vf]\:\frac{rad}{s}`], how much friction force did the tradesperson apply with the scrap piece? 
The grindstone can be modelled as a single [`[$M]\:kg`] block rotating at [`[$R]\:meters`] away from the centre. Neglect the size of the block.

[`F_{friction} = `][_____]{"$Ff"}[`N`]
