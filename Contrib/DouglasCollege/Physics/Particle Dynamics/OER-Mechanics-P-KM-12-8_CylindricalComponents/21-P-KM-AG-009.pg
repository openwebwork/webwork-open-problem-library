You are a hapless adventurer running from a scary monster that moves with a maximum speed of [`[$V]`] meters per second. You spot a very tall cylindrical tower. As you approach, running for your life, you notice that it has a long pole going down the middle, [`[$D1]`] meters away from any edge. You begin to form a plan. If you manage to outrun the creature going up the staircase then slide back down the pole, you’ll be able to successfully make your escape.

What is the minimum angular velocity you would need to run on the staircase at to stay ahead of the monster?

[`angular\:velocity = `][_____]{"$velocity_ang"}[`rad/s`]

You remember that in your “Adventuring 101” course, you practiced running [`[$R]`] revolutions per minute up a staircase with radius [`[$D2]`] meters. Will your escape plan work?
