An adventurer, still running from a scary monster, has come across a fast-flowing river. Their only option to escape is to cross the river. The river is [`[$D1]`] meters across and the water flows at [`[$V1] \: m/s`]. The adventurer can row at [`[$V2] \: m/s`] in still water. They can also hear the roar of a raging waterfall only [`[$D2]`] meters downstream. Determine the angle (in degrees) measured from the vertical line AB that the adventurer must angle their boat into the current to get straight across the river. Also determine the speed of the boat from the perspective of the monster, who got to the river just after the adventurer started their crossing and is now standing still on the shore.

[`\theta = `][_____]{"$theta_d"}

[`velocity_{from\:the\:monster's\:perspective} = `][_____]{"$v"}
