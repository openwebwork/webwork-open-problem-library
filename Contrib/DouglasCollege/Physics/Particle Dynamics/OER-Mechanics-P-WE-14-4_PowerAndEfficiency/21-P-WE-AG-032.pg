A [`[$m1]\:kg`] car starts from rest and accelerates up to speed. The engine that has an efficiency of [`[$e]`] and a constant power input of [`[$P]\:kilowatts`]. 
The coefficient of friction between the road and the wheels of the car is [`[$mu]`]. The driver has an option to attach a [`[$m2]\:kg`] trolley for bigger items. 
How much faster, as a percentage, is the car going at [`t=[$T]\:seconds`], when the trolley is not attached to the car versus when it is attached to the car?

_Assume [`g=[$g]\:m/s^2`]_
