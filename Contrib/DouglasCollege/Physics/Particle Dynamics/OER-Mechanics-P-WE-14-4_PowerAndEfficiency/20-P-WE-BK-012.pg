A trebuchet uses a falling counterweight to launch a projectile. It can be thought of 
as a machine that converts the gravitational potential energy of the counterweight
into kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the projectile.
The counterweight has a mass of [`[$mc] \: kg`] and drops [`[$hc] \: m`].
The projectile has a mass of [`[$mp] \: kg`], and starts on the ground.
When it leaves the sling, it has a height of [`[$hp] \: m`] speed of [`[$v] \: m/s`].

If the average power used in lifting the counterweight is [`[$Pc] \: W`], 
find the time it takes to lift it from the ground to its full height.

[`t_{lifting} =`] [______]{"$tc"} [`s`]

If the projectile goes from rest to its maximum speed in [`[$tp] \: s`].
find the average power used in launching the projectile in this time period.

[`P_{projectile} =`] [______]{"$Pp"} [`W`]

Find the efficiency of the trebuchet.

[`Efficiency =`] [______]{"$eff"} [`%`]
