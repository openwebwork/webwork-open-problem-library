BEGIN_PGML

----  
Define a sequence [`s_n`] for [`n\geq 1`] by 
[`` s_n = 1 + 2 + \dots +n ``]. 

We wish to use induction to prove that [`` s_n = [$closedForm] ``] for each natural number [``n\geq 1``].


----  
## 1. Understand The Question

First, we must write a *recursive* definition of the sequence [`s_n`].

For the base case, [`s_1 = `] [______]{$s1}.

For each [`k`] such that [`s_k`] is defined, [`s_{k+1} =`] [______]{$skplus1Defn}.
*Note:* To enter [`s_k`], type _sk_ 


----  
## 2. The Proof by Induction.

We proceed by induction on [`n`], with induction hypothesis
[@ $stateIH->menu @]*

END_PGML
ANS($stateIH->cmp());# Answer checker for the popup list object.
BEGIN_PGML

(a) *Base Case*

We first show that the induction hypothesis holds when [`n=1`].

[` s_1 = `] [___________]{$s1}

[``[$closedForm] = ``][__________]{$s1}. 
*Note:* Simplify your answer completely.


(b) *Inductive Step*

Suppose that we _know_ that the inductive hypothesis holds for [`n=k`].  
 
>>In other words,[@ $supposeIHk->menu @]* [@ $applyIH->menu @]*<<
END_PGML
ANS($supposeIHk->cmp());# Answer checker for the popup list object.
ANS($applyIH->cmp());# Answer checker for the popup list object.
BEGIN_PGML

We must _show_ that the inductive hypothesis also holds for [`n=k+1`].

>>In other words, [@ $proveIHkplus1->menu @]* [@ $nextIH->menu @]*<<
END_PGML
ANS($proveIHkplus1->cmp());# Answer checker for the popup list object.
ANS($nextIH->cmp());# Answer checker for the popup list object.
BEGIN_PGML

In the first blank, enter the recursive *definition* of [`s_n`] (in terms of [`sk`] and [`k`]).  In the second blank, show the result of applying the inductive hypothesis, but do *not* simplify the expression.  

[` s_{n} = `] [____________]{$skplus1Defn} = [____________]{$skplus1Plugged}

Then check that the induction hypothesis continues to hold for [`n=k+1`] by rewriting [`s_n`] until you get the desired expression (in terms of [`k`]).  Enter that into the blank.

[`` [$closedForm] = ``] [_____________]{$closedFormKplus1}

END_PGML

# Old Version (hardcoded)
#[` s_{n} = `] [____________]{sk + (k+1)} = [____________]{(k)*(k+1)/2 + (k+1)}
#[` \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} = `] [_____________]{(k+1)*(k+1+1)/2}


BEGIN_PGML_HINT
The goal of this problem is to help you learn the details of a *proof* by induction. 

If you have answers that are being marked wrong, make sure you are not skipping any steps!  

In particular, the goal is to *prove* that [`s_{k+1} = \dfrac{(k+1)(k+1 + 1)}{2}`].  
You cannot *use* this when  proving  the induction hypothesis.
