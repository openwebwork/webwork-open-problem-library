BEGIN_PGML

You are driving along the highway.
Suppose that your position is given by function [`f(t)`]
which outputs your current position (using the highway mile markers) 
as a function of the time [`t`] in hours that you have been driving.  

After [`[$xone]`] hours, you notice that [`f([$xone]) = [$yone] `] and that [`f'([$xone]) = [$rate]`].  


Determine if each of the following statements are *true or false*.  Be able to provide an *explanation* for your answer.
