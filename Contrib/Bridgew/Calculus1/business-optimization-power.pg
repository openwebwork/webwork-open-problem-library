BEGIN_PGML

Suppose that the (demand) price for your novelty enamel pin business is given by 

[` p(x) = \frac{[$a]}{x^{1/[$k]}} `] 

and that each unit costs $[$cost] 


Find the quantity where *profit* is maximized.


Quantity = [_______]{"$slnx"}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
In this problem, you are *given* a unit price function and a cost function, but you *want* a total profit function. 


## Setting Up the Problem 

Remember our two key business formulas

1. Profit = Revenue - Cost 
2. Revenue = (unit price)(number of units) = [`p \cdot x`]
3. Cost = (variable cost)(number of units) + fixed cost

Formula 2 allows us to use unit price = [` p(x) = \frac{[$a]}{x^{1/[$k]}} `] to compute the total revenue function.

Revenue = [` R(x) =  \frac{[$a]}{x^{1/[$k]}} \cdot x = [$a] \cdot x^{-1/[$k]}\cdot x^1 = [$a] \cdot x^{(1-1/[$k])}`] 

Formula 3 allows us to find the total cost function.  We are told that the variable cost is $[$cost], and there is no fixed cost given.  That means [`C(x) = [$cost]x`]


Formula 1 allows us to compute the total profit function [`P(x) = R(x) - C(x)`]  

The problem now asks us to *maximize* this profit function as usual.  


## Useful Tricks for Finding Critical Numbers:

When you do that, you will eventually need to solve for the values of [`x`] in an equation with  an expression of the form [`x^{-1/m} `] for some constant number [`m`].
 The key idea is to recall that [`x^{-1/m} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[m]{x}}`].   

To solve, for example [` x^{-1/9} = 15 `], you would proceed as follows:

Rewrite as  
    [` \frac{1}{\sqrt[9]{x}} = 15`] 

Multiply both sides by [`\sqrt[9]{x}`] to get  
    [`1 = 15 \sqrt[9]{x}`]

Divide both sides by [`15`] to get  
    [` \sqrt[9]{x} = \frac{1}{15}`]

Raise both sides to the [`9`]th power to get  
    [` x = \left(\frac{1}{15}\right)^9 `]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In this problem, you are *given* a unit price function and a cost function, but you *want* a total profit function.

Remember our two key business formulas

1. Profit = Revenue - Cost
2. Revenue = (unit price)(number of units) = [`p \cdot x`]
3. Cost = (variable cost)(number of units) + fixed cost

Because unit price = [` p(x) = \frac{[$a]}{x^{1/[$k]}} `], formula 2 allows us to compute the total revenue function.

Revenue = [` R(x) =  \frac{[$a]}{x^{1/[$k]}} \cdot x = [$a] \cdot x^{-1/[$k]}\cdot x^1 = [$a] \cdot x^{(1-1/[$k])}`]

In the problem, we are told that the variable cost is $[$cost], and there is no fixed cost given.  Formula 3 allows us to compute the total Cost function.

[`C(x) = [$cost]x`]


Now formula 1 allows us to compute the total profit function.

[`P(x) = R(x) - C(X) =  [$a] \cdot x^{[$kminusone]/[$k]} -  [$cost]x`]


The problem now asks us to maximize this profit function.

To do this, first compute [`P'(x) = [$a]\cdot\frac{[$kminusone]}{[$k]}\cdot x^{-1/[$k]} - [$cost] `] and find the critical numbers.

Note that [`P'=DNE`] when [` x = 0`].

Note also that [`P'=0`] if and only if [` [$a]\cdot\frac{[$kminusone]}{[$k]}\cdot x^{-1/[$k]} = [$cost] `]

[`P'=0 \iff [$a]\cdot\frac{[$kminusone]}{[$k]}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt[[$k]]{x}} = [$cost] 	`]

[`\phantom{P'=0}\iff  [$a]\cdot\frac{[$kminusone]}{[$k]}  = [$cost] \cdot \sqrt[[$k]]{x} `]

[`\phantom{P'=0}\iff  [$a]\cdot\frac{[$kminusone]}{[$k]}\cdot\frac{1}{[$cost]}  = \sqrt[[$k]]{x} `]

[`\phantom{P'=0}\iff  [$slnx] = x`]

It follows that the two critical numbers are [`x=0`] and [`x=[$slnx]`]. 

Making the sign chart for [`P'`], we see that the maximum profit occurs at [`x = [$slnx]`]
