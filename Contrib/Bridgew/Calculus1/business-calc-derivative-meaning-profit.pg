BEGIN_PGML

Suppose that a certain function [`P(x)`] gives the net profit in dollars due to selling [`x`] units.  

Suppose also that [`P([$xone]) = [$yone] `] and that [`P'([$xone]) = [$rate]`].  


Determine if each of the following statements are *true or false*.  Be able to provide an *explanation* for your answer.
