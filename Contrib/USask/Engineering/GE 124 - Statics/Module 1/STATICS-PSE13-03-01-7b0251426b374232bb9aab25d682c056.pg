Consider the following scenario:



The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?



Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is 212.55246.  From the list below, select all the correct options depicting the correct presentation of the conclusion with correct notation. 

The magnitude of the resultant force acting on the screw force due to the two ropes is \(____\).
