Consider the following scenario:



The ring at point A is attached by a spring to the wall at point C and a by a rope to another wall at point B, while being pulled by a second rope with force F=600N. The spring AC has a spring constant \(k_{AC}\)=20 N/m.  What is the unstretched length of the spring AC?

$BR



Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is 0.6601955. From the list below, select the best presentation of the conclusion with the correct number of significant figures. 

"The unstretched length of the spring AC is  \(____\)."
