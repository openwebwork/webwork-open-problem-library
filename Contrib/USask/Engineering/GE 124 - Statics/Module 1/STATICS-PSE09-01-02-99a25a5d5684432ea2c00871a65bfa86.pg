Consider the following scenario:



Strut AB is connected at point B to the floor and juts out at an angle of \(\alpha\)=45 \(^\circ\), measured CW from the positive y axis. Strut AC is connected at point C to a spot on the vertical wall, directly above point B. The struts are connected to each other at point A. The angle between struts AB and AC is \(\beta\)=30 \(^\circ\). If a downward force of F=450lb is applied to point A, what is the force directed from point A to point B?



From the list below, select the correct option depicting the information that you need to find in the above problem.
