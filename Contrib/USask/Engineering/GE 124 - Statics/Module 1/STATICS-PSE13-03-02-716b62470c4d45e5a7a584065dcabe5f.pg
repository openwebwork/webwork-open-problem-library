Consider the following scenario:



If a downward force of F=450lb is applied to point A in the strut system shown below, what is the force vector directed along strut AB in Cartesian form?  The angle between the struts \(\theta_2\) is 30 \(^\circ\)and the angle between strut AB and the downward force F is \(\theta_1\)=45 \(^\circ\).




Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is 155.3202 in the x direction and 389.2256 in the y direction.  From the list below, select all correct depictions of the conclusion with correct notation. 

The force vector directed along strut AB in Cartesian form is \(____\).
