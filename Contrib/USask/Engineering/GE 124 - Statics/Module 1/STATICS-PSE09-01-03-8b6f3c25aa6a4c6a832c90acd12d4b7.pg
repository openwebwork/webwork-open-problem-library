Consider the following scenario:



A ring (point A) is suspended in mid-air by a spring and two ropes.  The spring is attached to a vertical wall on the left at point C and one rope is attached to a vertical wall on the right at point B. The spring AC is horizontal and has a spring constant of \(k_{AC}\)=20N/m. The rope AB is attached to the wall such that it has an angle of \(\theta_{AB}\)=60 \(^\circ\), measured CCW from the positive x axis.  The second rope pulls on the ring with a force of F=600 N at an angle of \(\theta_F\)=45 \(^\circ\), measured CW from the positive x axis.  If rope AB has a length of 0.5 m and the stretched length of spring AC is 0.75 m, what is the unstretched length of the spring?
