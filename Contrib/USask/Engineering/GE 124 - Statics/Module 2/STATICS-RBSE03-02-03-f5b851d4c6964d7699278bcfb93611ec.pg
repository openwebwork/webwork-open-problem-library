Consider the following problem statement:



Due to an unequal distribution of fuel in the wing tanks, the centers of gravity for the airplane fuselage A and wings B and C are located as shown. If these components have weights \(W_A\)=45,000lb, \(W_B\)=8000 lb, and \(W_C\)=6000 lb, determine the normal reactions of the wheels D, E, and F on the ground.
