#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Let the random variable \( X \) be the number of rooms in a randomly chosen owner-occupied housing unit in a certain city.  The distribution for the units is given 
below.
$PAR
\{begintable(9)\}
\{row("\(X\)", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", " 10 ")\} 
\{row("\( P(X) \)", "\($p3\)", "\($p4\)", "\($p5\)", "\($p6\)", "\($p7\)", "\($p8\)", "\($p9\)", "  ? " )\} 
\{endtable()\}

$PAR
(a)  Is \(X\) a discrete or continuous random variable?  (Type: DISCRETE or CONTINUOUS)
$BR
     ANSWER: \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b)  What must be the probability of choosing a unit with 10 rooms?
      \(P(X = 10)\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(c)  $sevent[0] = \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(d)  $sevent[1] = \{ans_rule(10)\}
