BEGIN_TEXT
The distribution of heights of adult men in the U.S. is approximately normal with mean 69 inches and 
standard deviation 2.5 inches.  Use what you know about a normal distribution and the Empirical rule to answer the following. 
$PAR
$BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD If your answer is a percent, such as 25 percent, enter: "25 PERCENT" (without the quotes).  If your answer is in inches, such as 10 inches, enter: "10 
INCHES" (without the quotes and with a
space between the number and the INCHES).  If your answer is an interval, such as 14 to 15 inches, then enter:
 "14 TO 15 INCHES" (without the quotes).  Do not use extra zeros and do not include a decimal point unless your answer is not a whole number.  Your answer must be entered in the correct format. $PAR
