BEGIN_TEXT
 To determine whether or not they have a certain disease, $n people are to have their blood tested. However, rather than testing each
individual separately, it has been decided first to group the people in groups of 10. The blood samples of the 10 people in each group will be
pooled and analyzed together. If the test is negative. one test will suffice for the 10 people (we are assuming that the pooled test will be
positive if and only if at least one person in the pool has the disease); whereas, if the test is positive each of the
10 people will also be individually tested and, in all, 11 tests will be made on this group.
$BR
Assume the probability that a person has the
disease is $p for all people, independently of each other.

$PAR
Compute the expected number of tests necessary for each group. 
$BR
Expected number for each group: \{ $ans->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Number the $g groups of 10 people from 1 to $g, and for \(1\leq i \leq $g\), let \(X_i\) be the total number of tests that are made on group \(i\).  Then \(X_i=1\) if the test on group \(i\) is negative, i.e. if none of the 10 people in group \(i\) have the disease, and \(X_i=11\) if the initial test on group \(i\) is positive, i.e. if at least one of the people in group \(i\) has the disease.  For each \(i\) we then have
\[ \begin{aligned}
E[X_i]  & = 1 \cdot P(X_i =1) + 11 \cdot P(X_i = 11) \\
& = 1\cdot ($q)^{10} + 11 \cdot (1-($q)^{10}) \\
& = 11 - 10($q)^{10}.
\end{aligned}\]

END_SOLUTION

# $PAR
# (b) The total number of tests is then the sum of the total number of tests for the groups, so the expected total number of tests necessary for the entire population of $n people is 
# \[ \begin{aligned}
# E\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{$g} X_i \right] &= \sum_{i=1}^{$g} E[X_i]\\
# & = \sum_{i=1}^{$g} \left(11 - 10($q)^{10}\right) \\
# & = $g \left(11-10($q)^{10}\right).
# \end{aligned} \]
