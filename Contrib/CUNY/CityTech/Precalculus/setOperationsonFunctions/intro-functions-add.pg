>> ### Introduction to Combining Functions ### <<

We usually define [`y`] (the _dependent_ variable) in terms of [`x`] (the _independent_ variable), like so:  
>> [` y = [$f] `] <<

It is understood that the value of [`y`] _depends_ on the value of [`x`]. Specifically, [`y`] is [@$word[abs($fC)]@] [@($fC>0)?"more":"less"@] than the product of [$word[$fB]] and [`x`]. Here, [`x`] takes the role of "_input_" and [`y`] takes the role of "_output_".

But what about when we have more than one definition for [`y`]? Maybe we'd like to consider [` y = [$g] `] in addition to having [` y = [$f] `].

This is part of the reason for functional notation. Instead of using the dependent variable [`y`], we use the notation [`f(x)`]. This means we can describe multiple "functions" at the same time, like so:  
>> [` f(x) = [$f] `] <<  
>> [` g(x) = [$g] `] <<  

From these two functions, we can define _new_ functions:  
* [`(f+g)(x)`] = the _sum_ of [`f(x)`] and [`g(x)`]
* [`(f-g)(x)`] = the _difference_ of [`g(x)`] from [`f(x)`]
* [`(fg)(x)`] = the _product_ of [`f(x)`] and [`g(x)`]
* [`\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)(x)`] = the _quotient_ of [`f(x)`] by [`g(x)`]

>> #### Practice #### <<

Consider [` f(x) = [$f] `] and [` g(x) = [$g] `].

* You must combine all like terms before you submit your answer.
* You must expand all products before your submit your answer.

a. What is the sum of [`f(x)`] and [`g(x)`]?  
[`(f+g)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$fPlusg}

b. What is the difference of [`g(x)`] from [`f(x)`]?  
[`(f-g)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$fMinusg}

c. What is the difference of [`f(x)`] from [`g(x)`]?  
[`(g-f)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$gMinusf}

d. What is the product of [`f(x)`] and [`g(x)`]?  
[`(fg)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$fTimesg}

e. What is the quotient of [`f(x)`] by [`g(x)`]?  
[`\left(\dfrac{f}{g}\right)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$fByg}

f. What is the quotient of [`g(x)`] by [`f(x)`]?  
[`\left(\dfrac{g}{f}\right)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$gByf}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* If you are calculating a difference or a product, enclose each function in  parentheses.

* If you have a difference, the next step is to distribute the negative sign  over _each_ term within the parentheses.

* Expand all products. 

* Combine all like terms.
