>> ### Composition of Functions ### <<

Given the functions [`f(x)`] and [`g(x)`], we can calculate the compositions [`(f\circ g)(x)`] and [`(g\circ f)(x)`]. Here the order matters.  In general, [`(f\circ g)(x)`] and [`(g\circ f)(x)`] are not the same functions.  

For [`f(x)=x-7`] and [`g(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2-100}`], let's evaluate the new functions [`(f\circ g)(x)`] and [`(g\circ f)(x)`]. 

* [`(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))`]

>>[`f(x)=x-7 \quad\underset{x\;\rightarrow\; g(x)}\implies\quad   f(g(x))=g(x) - 7 \quad\underset{g(x)= \frac{1}{x^2-100}}=\quad \dfrac{1}{x^2-100}-7`] <<

* [`(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))`]

>>[`g(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2-100} \quad\underset{x\;\rightarrow\; f(x)}\implies\quad   g(f(x))=\dfrac{1}{(f(x))^2-100} \quad\underset{f(x)= x-7}= \quad \dfrac{1}{(x-7)^2-100}= \quad \dfrac{1}{x^2-14x-51}`]<<

Recall that every function has a domain. 
How can we find the *domain of a composition* of functions?
Note that [`(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))`] is the evaluation of the function [`f(x)`] for the input [`g(x)`].  This evaluation is possible if:

[`\qquad (i)`] the input [`g(x)`] can be evaluated, that is, [`x`] is in the domain of [`g(x)`], and

[`\qquad (ii)`] the output [`f(g(x))`] can be evaluated, that is, [`g(x)`] is in the domain of [`f(x)`].

So the domain of [`(f\circ g)(x)`] consists of all [`x`]'s in the domain of [`g(x)`] for which the output [`g(x)`] is in the domain of [`f(x)`]. 

Let's find the domain of each function above. 

* Domain of [`f(x)=x-7`]: 

This is a polynomial function; so the domain of [`f(x)`]  is [`(-\infty,\infty)`].

* Domain of [`g(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2-100}`]: 

We need to ensure that the denominator is not zero:

>>[` x^2-100 \neq 0 \quad\implies\quad (x+10)(x-10)\neq 0
\quad\implies\quad  x\neq -10\quad`] and [`\quad x\neq 10`] <<

The domain of [`g(x)`]  is [`(-\infty,-10)\cup(-10,10)\cup(10,\infty)`].

* Domain of [`(f\circ g)(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2-100}-7`]: 

[`\qquad (i)`]  first we need to consider the domain of [`g(x)`] which consists of all [`x`]'s such that [`x\neq -10`] and [`x\neq 10`]; 

[`\qquad (ii)`]  the domain of [`f(x)`] consists of all real numbers, so there is no restriction here.

Therefore the domain of [`(f\circ g)(x)`] is [`(-\infty,-10)\cup(-10,10)\cup(10,\infty)`].

* Domain of [`(g\circ f)(x) = \dfrac{1}{(x-7)^2-100}`]:

We discussed above how to find the domain of [`(f\circ g)(x)`].  To find the
domain of [`(g\circ f)(x)`], we need to reverse the roles of [`f(x)`] and [`g(x)`]. We can calculate [`(g\circ f)(x) =g(f(x))`], which is the evaluation of the function [`g(x)`] for the input [`f(x)`], if:

[`\qquad (i)`]  [`f(x)`] can be evaluated, that is, [`x`] is in the domain of [`f(x)`]; the domain of [`f(x)`] consists of all real numbers, so there is no restriction here; and

[`\qquad (ii)`]  [`f(x)`] is in the domain of [`g(x)`], which is [`(-\infty,-10)\cup(-10,10)\cup(10,\infty)`]. In order for [`f(x)`] to belong to this interval, we must have

>> [`(f(x)\neq -10\quad `] and [`\quad f(x)\neq 10)\quad\underset{f(x)=x-7}\implies\quad (x-7\neq -10 \quad`] and [`\quad x-7\neq 10) `]<<

>>[`\quad\implies\quad \quad (x\neq -3 \quad`]  and [`\quad x\neq 17)`].<<

Similarly, we can also check (ii) by requiring the denominator of [`g(f(x))`] to be different from zero:

>> [`(x-7)^2-100 \neq 0 \quad\implies\quad x^2-14x-51 \neq 0
\quad\implies\quad (x+3)(x-17)\neq 0 \quad\implies\quad 
(x\neq -3`] and [`x\neq 17)`] <<

Therefore the domain of [`(g\circ f)(x)`] is [`(-\infty,-3)\cup(-3,17)\cup(17,\infty)`].

*Note:* To find the domain of a composition of functions, you must find the restrictions in [`(i)`] and [`(ii)`].  The algebraic simplification not always gives the correct domain.

>> #### Practice #### <<

Consider [`f(x)=[$f]`] and [`g(x)=\displaystyle{[$g]}`].

* You must combine all like terms before you submit your answer.
* You must expand all products before your submit your answer.

a. Simplify: [` (f \circ g)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$fOfgX}

b. What is the domain of [` (f \circ g)(x) `]? [_____________________________]{$fOfgDom}

c. Simplify: [` (g \circ f)(x) = `][_____________________________]{$gOffX}

d. What is the domain of [` (g \circ f)(x) `]? [_____________________________]{$gOffDom}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

**To find the composition** 

* What is the _function_ you want to evaluate?
* What is the _input_?
* Plug the _input_ into the _function_.

**To find the domain of a composition**

* Do not use your algebraic simplication for the composition to find its domain.
* Find all [`x`]'s for which you can calculate the _input_.
* Find all [`x`]'s for which the _input_ belongs to the domain of the _function_.
* Find all [`x`]'s satisfying each one of the above restrictions.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. We have that [` (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))`], which is the evaluation of the function [`f(x)`] for the input [`g(x)`].

    >> [`f(x) = [$f] \quad\underset{x\;\rightarrow\; g(x)}\implies\quad f(g(x))
=  g(x)+ [$fC] \quad\underset{g(x)=[$g]}= \quad   \displaystyle{[$fOfgX]}`] <<

    So [`(f \circ g)(x) = \displaystyle{[$fOfgX]}`].

b. To find the domain of [`(f \circ g)(x)`], we need to find all [`x`]'s for which:

    [`\qquad (i)`] the input [`g(x)`] can be evaluated, that is, [`x`] is in the domain of [`g(x)`], which is [`[$fOfgDom]`]; and

    [`\qquad (ii)`] the output [`f(g(x))`] can be evaluated, that is, [`g(x)`] is in the domain of [`f(x)`].  Since the domain of [`f(x)`] is [`\mathbb R`], we do not have to worry about this condition.

    The domain of [`(f \circ g)(x)`] is [`[$fOfgDom]`].

c. We have that [` (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))`], which is the evaluation of the function [`g(x)`] for the input [`f(x)`].  
  
    >> [`g(x) = \displaystyle{[$g]} \quad\underset{x\;\rightarrow\;f(x)}\implies\quad g(f(x)) =  \displaystyle{[$gevalf]}`] <<
    
    >> [`\quad\underset{f(x)=[$f]} =\quad  \displaystyle{[$g->substitute(x=>$f)]}   \quad =\quad \displaystyle{[$gOffX]}`] <<  
  
    So [` (g \circ f)(x) = \displaystyle{[$gOffX]}`].  


d. To find the domain of [`(g \circ f)(x)`], we need to find all [`x`]'s for which:

    [`\qquad (i)`] the input [`f(x)`] can be evaluated, that is, [`x`] is in the domain of [`f(x)`], which is [`\mathbb R`];

    [`\qquad (ii)`] the output [`g(f(x))`] can be evaluated, that is, [`f(x)`] is in the domain of [`g(x)`].  Since the domain of [`g(x)`] is [`(-\infty,[$gRoot2])\cup([$gRoot2],[$gRoot1])\cup([$gRoot1],\infty)`], we need to make sure that:
    
    >>[`(f(x)\neq [$gRoot2]\quad `] and [`\quad f(x)\neq [$gRoot1]) \quad\implies\quad ([$f] \neq [$gRoot2] \quad `] and [` \quad [$f] \neq [$gRoot1])`] <<

    >>[`\implies \quad (x\neq [$gRoot2-$fC]\quad`] and [`\quad x\neq [$gRoot1-$fC])`] <<


    The domain of [`(g \circ f)(x)`] is [`[$gOffDom]`].
