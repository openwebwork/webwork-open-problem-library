>> ### Graphs of Logarithmic Functions ### <<

We have seen that for *any* function [`f(x) =\log_{B}(x) `], with [`B > 0`] and [`B \neq 1`]: 


* the domain will be [`(0,\infty)`] i.e. [`x>0`]
* there will be a vertical asymptote at [`x=0`]
* there will be an [`x`]-intercept at [`(1,0)`] i.e. [`x=1`]

This means that for a general function [`f(x) =\log_{B}(\square) `], with [`B > 0`] and [`B \neq 1`]: 
 

* We know that the domain will be the values of [`x`] such that [`\square > 0`]
* We know that there will be a vertical asymptote at the value of [`x`] such that [`\square = 0`]
* We know that there will be an [`x`]-intercept at [`(A,0)`] where [`A`] is the value of [`x`] such that [`\square = 1`] 

Let's consider a shifted logarithmic function, for instance [`f(x) =\log_{3}(2x-5) `] and see what happens to the domain, asymptote and intercept.

First, let's look at the graph:

>> [@ image(insertGraph($gr1),height=>400,width=>400,tex_size=>800) @]* <<

We expect the domain, asymptote and [`x`]-intercept to have shifted, and we see that on the graph. We can read that the domain is [`(\frac{5}{2},\infty)`], the asymptote is at [`x=\frac{5}{2}`] and the [`x`]-intercept is at [`(3,0)`].

But we can also verify all of these results without using the graph at all:

* the domain will be the values of [`x`] such that [`2x-5>0`], which is [`x>\frac{5}{2}`];  
switching over to interval notation, our domain is [`(\frac{5}{2},\infty)`]
* the vertical asymptote will occur at the value of [`x`] such that [`2x-5=0`], which is [`x=\frac{5}{2}`]
* the [`x`]-intercept will occur at [`(A,0)`] where [`A`] is the value of [`x`] such that [`2x-5=1`], which is [`2x=6`], or [`x=3`];  
so we think that our [`x`]-intercept is the point [`(3,0)`];  
and we can verify this by: [`\displaystyle f(3) = \log_3\left(2(3)-5\right) = \log_3(1) = 0`].


>> ### Practice ### <<

Consider the function [`f(x) = [$f]`]. 


a. The domain of the function is [_______________]{$logDom->cmp()->withPostFilter($adjustError)}

b. The asymptote of the function is [_______________]{$logVA->cmp()->withPostFilter($custom)}

c. Our function has an [`x`]-intercept at [_______________]{$logInt}

* Use "log3( )" to represent [`\log_3( )`].
* Use "inf" and "-inf" to represent [`\infty`] and [`-\infty`].
* Make sure to enter your asymptote as an equation.
* Make sure to enter your intercept as a point.
