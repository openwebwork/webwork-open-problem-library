The function [`C`] models the number of customers that are in a store [`t`] hours after the store opened on a certain day.

a)  [`C([$x1])=`][_________]

b) Interpret the meaning of [`C([$x1])`]:

    [@$radio1->buttons()@]*

c) Solve [`C(t)=[$y2]`] for [`t`]. [@KeyboardInstructions('Use commas to separate your answers if there are more than one solution.')@]** [`t=`][________]

d) Interpret the meaning of Part c's solution(s):

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
What is the meaning of [`t`]? What are the units of [`t`]?

What is the meaning of [`C(t)`]? What are the units of [`C(t)`]?

END_PGML_HINT

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) According to data in the table, [`C([$x1])=[$y1]`].

b) Answer is that there were [`[$y1]`] customers in the store [`[$x1]`] hours after the store opened.

c) According to data in the table, [`C([$x2])=[$y2]`] and [`C([$x3])=[$y3]`]. So the answer is [`[$ans3]`].

d) Answer is that there were [`[$y2]`] customers in the store [`[$x2]`] hours after the store opened, and again [`[$x3]`] hours after the store opened.
