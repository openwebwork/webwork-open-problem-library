BEGIN_PGML

[$name] started saving in a piggy bank on [$possessive] birthday. The function [`f(x)=[$func]`] models the amount of money, in dollars, in [$name]'s piggy bank. The independent variable represents the number of days passed since [$possessive] birthday.

Interpret the meaning of [`f([$x1])=[$y1]`].

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

ANS( $radio->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
For [`f(x)=[$func]`], what does the value of [`x`] respresent? 

What does the value of [`f(x)`] represent?

What are the units of [`x`]?

What are the units of [`f(x)`]?

END_PGML_HINT

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For [`f(x)=[$func]`], the value of [`x`] represents the number of days passed since [$name]'s birthday, and the value of [`f(x)`] represents the amount of money in the piggy bank.

It's helpful to understand those values by units: [`x`] is in "days," while [`f(x)`] is in "dollars."

For [`f([$x1])=[$y1]`], [`[$x1]`] represents [`[$x1]`] days, while [`[$y1]`] represents [`[$y1]`] dollars. The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
