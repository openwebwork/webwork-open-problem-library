BEGIN_PGML

>> ### Graphs of Exponential Functions ### <<

The exponential function [`f(x)=-3 \cdot 2^x`] has base [`2`], so we would expect its graph's right tail to shoot up and left tail to flatten.

However, this is its graph:

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr1),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<

We notice that the right tail shoots down not up as we thought. [$GrVe[$ChVe]]How come?

If we find the [`y`]-intercept for [`f(x)`] we find that it is [`(0,-3)`]. This tells us that the graph has to pass through this point, and thus, there is no way for the right tail to shoot up. 

The answer to what is happening simply lies in the negative coefficient.

A negative coefficient will flip the behavior of the tail of an exponential function. 


Notice for instance the graph of [`g(x)=-3\cdot (0.75)^x`].

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr2),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<

Instead of the graph's left tail shooting up as expected (since its base is less than [`1`]), it shoots down because the coefficient is negative. 

>> ### Practice ### <<


>> [@ image( insertGraph($gr), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>800 ) @]* <<

Assuming that [`f(x)`] is of the form [` A \cdot B^x `], write an expression for [`f(x)`]:

[`f(x)`] = [_______________]{$f}

#  Answers

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

What is [`f(0)`] on the graph? What is [`f(0)`] using [`A \cdot B^x`]?

What is [`f(1)`] on the graph? What is [`f(1)`] using [`A \cdot B^x`]?

Use the answers to these questions to determine the appropriate values for [`A`] and [`B`].
