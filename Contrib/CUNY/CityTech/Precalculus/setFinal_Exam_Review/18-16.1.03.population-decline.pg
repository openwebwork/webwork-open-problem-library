In [`[$year]`], the population of a city is [`[$initial_population]`], and is decreasing exponentially at [`[$rate]%`] per year.

a. What is the population size after [`[$wait_time]`] years? [_________________________]{$laterpopulation}

b. In what year will half of the population be left? [_________________________]{$halftime}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We use the exponential model [`P(t)=P_0 \cdot e^{r\cdot t}`] for our model of the population of the city, where
* [`P_0`] is the initial population
* [`t`] is the number of years after the year [`[$year]`]
* [`r`] is the rate of change per year 
* [`P(t)`] is the population size [`t`] years after the year [`[$year]`]

Identifying the given values [`P_0=[$initial_population]`] and [`r=-[$rate]%=-[$rateDeci]`] (which is negative since the population is decreasing). We therefore use the model:
[``` P(t)=[$initial_population] \cdot e^{-[$rateDeci]\cdot t}
```]

a. After [`[$wait_time]`] years, the population size is [`P([$wait_time])=[$initial_population] \cdot e^{-[$rateDeci]\cdot [$wait_time]}\approx[$popApprox]`].

b. If [`t`] is the number of years that it takes until half of the population are left, then [`t`] satisfies [`\frac {P_0}2=P_0\cdot e^{-[$rateDeci]\cdot t}`]. We solve this for [`t`]. First, divide by [`P_0`] gives [`\frac 1 2=e^{-[$rateDeci]\cdot t}`], and then taking the natural logarithm yields [`\ln(\frac 1 2)=\ln(e^{-[$rateDeci]\cdot t})`], or [`\ln(\frac 1 2)=-[$rateDeci]\cdot t\cdot \ln(e)=-[$rateDeci]\cdot t`]. Thus, we get that
[```
t=\dfrac{\ln(\frac 1 2)}{-[$rateDeci]}\approx [$halfSol]
```]
Starting from the year [`[$year]`], half of the population will be left in the year [`[$year]+[$halfSol]=[$halftime]`].
