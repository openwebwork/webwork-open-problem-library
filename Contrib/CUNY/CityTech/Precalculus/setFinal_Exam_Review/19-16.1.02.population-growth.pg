In [`[$year]`], the population of a country is [`[$initial_population]`], and is growing at [`[$rate]%`] per year.

a. What will the population be in [`[$wait_time_year]`]? [_________________________]{$laterpopulation}

b. In what year will the population be double? [_________________________]{$doubletime}

c. In what year will the population be triple? [_________________________]{$tripletime}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We use the exponential model [`P(t)=P_0 \cdot e^{r\cdot t}`] for our model of the population of the city, where
* [`P_0`] is the initial population
* [`t`] is the number of years after the year [`[$year]`]
* [`r`] is the rate of change per year 
* [`P(t)`] is the population size [`t`] years after the year [`[$year]`]

Identifying the given values [`P_0=[$initial_population]`] and [`r=[$rate]%=[$rateDeci]`] (which is positive since the population is growing). We therefore use the model:
[``` P(t)=[$initial_population] \cdot e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t}
```]

a. For the year [`[$wait_time_year]`], we set [`t=[$wait_time_year]-[$year]=[$wait_time]`]. With this, the population size is [`P([$wait_time])=[$initial_population] \cdot e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot [$wait_time]}\approx[$popApprox]`].

b. If [`t`] is the number of years that it takes until for the population to double, then [`t`] satisfies [`2\cdot P_0=P_0\cdot e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t}`]. We solve this for [`t`]. First, divide by [`P_0`] gives [`2=e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t}`], and then taking the natural logarithm yields [`\ln(2)=\ln(e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t})`], or [`\ln(2)=[$rateDeci]\cdot t\cdot \ln(e)=[$rateDeci]\cdot t`]. Thus, we get that
[```
t=\dfrac{\ln(2)}{[$rateDeci]}\approx [$doubletimeSol]
```]
Starting from the year [`[$year]`], the population will be double in the year [`[$year]+[$doubletimeSol]=[$doubletime]`].

c. If [`t`] is the number of years that it takes until for the population to triple, then [`t`] satisfies [`3\cdot P_0=P_0\cdot e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t}`]. We solve this for [`t`]. First, divide by [`P_0`] gives [`3=e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t}`], and then taking the natural logarithm yields [`\ln(3)=\ln(e^{[$rateDeci]\cdot t})`], or [`\ln(3)=[$rateDeci]\cdot t\cdot \ln(e)=[$rateDeci]\cdot t`]. Thus, we get that
[```
t=\dfrac{\ln(3)}{[$rateDeci]}\approx [$tripletimeSol]
```]
Starting from the year [`[$year]`], the population will be triple in the year [`[$year]+[$tripletimeSol]=[$tripletime]`].
