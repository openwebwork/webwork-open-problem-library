>> ### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ### <<


We have seen how every root of a polynomial corresponds to a factor. Furthermore, the factors determine the degree of the expanded polynomial. 

For example, what would the degree of [`f(x)=(x-3)(x-1)(x+1)`] be? 

When we multiply out the factors, we get [`f(x)=x^3-3x^2-x+3`], thus [`f(x)`] has degree 3. 

We can see from the graph of [`f(x)`] that it crosses the [`x`]-axis three times.

>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object1), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>400)@]* <<

What about [`g(x)=(x-2)(x+3)`]? 

This is a polynomial of degree 2, because when we multiply out the factors we get [`g(x)=x^2+x-6`]. It has two roots, [`x=2`] and [`x=-3`]. 

Its graph shows that it crosses the [`x`]-axis twice.

>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object2), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>400)@]* <<

Thinking in reverse, the degree tells us about the possible number of factors, which in turn determine the number of roots.

>>In fact, the degree of a polynomial tells us the _maximum number of factors_, thus determining the _maximum number of roots_. <<

>>A polynomial of degree [`n`] can have at most [`n`] roots, and its graph can cross the [`x`]-axis at most [`n`] times.<<

Now, what about constant factors? Do they play a role in determining the roots of a polynomial?

Do [`(x-3)(x+3)`] and [`2(x-3)(x+3)`] have different roots? What about [`3(x-3)(x+3)`]? Or [`4(x-3)(x+3)`]?

We can see that all these polynomials have the same factors, and thus the same roots. The only difference is the coefficient -- the constant factor.

The difference in coefficient merely "stretches" the graphs, as can be seen here from the graphs of [`(x-3)(x+3)`], [`2(x-3)(x+3)`] and [`3(x-3)(x+3)`], but the roots of all three polynomials are the same, as can be seen from their crossing with the [`x`]-axis.

>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object3), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>400)@]* <<

Where would [`4(x-3)(x+3)`] cross the [`x`]-axis then?


>> #### Practice #### <<

Consider the function [`f(x) = [$f]`].

* Enter the factors and the roots separated by a comma.

a. How many roots could [` f(x) `] have?

    [` f(x) `] has at most [_____]{$degree} roots.

b. List the factors of [` f(x) `].

    The factors of [`f(x)`] are [_______________]{$factors}.

c. List the roots of [` f(x) `].

    The roots of [`f(x)`] are [__________]{$roots}.
    
d. Give an example of a _different_ function with exactly the same roots as [` f(x) `].

    [`g(x) =`][____________________]{$ans->cmp(checker=>$checker)} is a new function with the same roots as [`f(x)`].

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* What is the degree of [`f(x)`]?  How is this number related to the number of roots of [`f(x)`]?

* Factor [`f(x)`] completely.

* Each factor [`x-c`] corresponds to the root [`c`].

* What is the root that is associated to the factor [`x`]?

* How about constant factors different from zero?  Do they change the roots of the polynomial?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. The polynomial [`f(x)`] has degree [`[$degree]`], and so it has at most [`[$degree]`] roots.

b. We have that [`f(x) = [$f] = x(x^2+[$fB]x+[$fC]) = \color{red}{x(x-[$r1])(x-[$r2])}`]. Therefore, the factors of [`f(x)`] are [`\color{red}{[$factors]}`].

c.  From (b), we have that [`f(x)=0`] means that [`\color{red}{x(x-[$r1])(x-[$r2])}=0`].
By the zero product rule, this implies that either one of the factors is zero.
>>[`\begin{align*}
\color{red}{x}={\color{blue}0} & \\
\color{red}{x-[$r1]} =0 &\quad\Longrightarrow\quad x=\color{blue}{[$r1]} \\
\color{red}{x-[$r2]} =0 &\quad\Longrightarrow\quad x=\color{blue}{[$r2]} \\
\end{align*}`]<<
So the roots of [`f(x)`] are [`\color{blue}{[$roots]}`].

d. Take any constant [`c`] different from zero.  Then the polynomial [`g(x) =c \cdot f(x) = c([$f])`] has the same roots as [`f(x)`], since the constant factor ([`\neq 0`]) does not alter the roots. For example, by taking [`c=3`], we obtain the polynomial [`g(x)=3([$f])`] as a possible answer.
