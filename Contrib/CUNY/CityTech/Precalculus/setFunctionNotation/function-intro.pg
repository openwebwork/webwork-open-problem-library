>> ### Introduction to Functions ### <<

We usually define [`y`] (the _dependent_ variable) in terms of [`x`] (the _independent_ variable), like so:  
>> [` y = 3x - 5 `] <<

It is understood that the value of [`y`] _depends_ on the value of [`x`]. Specifically, [`y`] is five less than the product of three and [`x`]. Here, [`x`] takes the role of "_input_" and [`y`] takes the role of "_output_".

But what about when we have more than one definition for [`y`]? Maybe we'd like to consider [` y = x^2 + 3x + 4 `] in addition to having [` y = 3x - 5 `].

This is part of the reason for functional notation. Instead of using the dependent variable [`y`], we instead use the notation [`f(x)`]. This means we can describe multiple "functions" at the same time, like so:  
>> [` f(x) = 3x - 5 `] <<  
>> [` g(x) = x^2 + 3x + 4 `] <<  

Now, if we want to discuss the "_output_" when the "_input_" is [`2`] (in other words, when [`x=2`]), we can use the letters "[`f`]" or "[`g`]" to specify which equation we are intending to substitute [`x=2`] into. 

Functional notation also simplifies this idea of "plugging in [`x=2`]" as we don't need to say "find [`y`] when [`x=2`]" anymore.  
Instead, writing [`f(2)`] expresses the same idea - specifically, we're taking [`f(x)`] and replacing [`x`] with [`2`], like so:  
>> [`f(2) = 3(2) - 5 `] <<

Notice that it looks _exactly_ like [`f(x)`], except that all the [`x`]'s have been replaced with [`2`]'s.  
Furthermore, we can simplify [`f(2) = 3(2) - 5`] as [`f(2) = 6 - 5`], and finally [`f(2) = 1`].  
In other words, the output of [`f(x)`] is [`1`] when the input is [`2`].

Doing the same for [`g(x)`], for example [`g(-1)`] means we want the _output_ of [`g(x)`] when [`x`] is replaced by [`-1`], like so:  
>> [` g(-1) = (-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 4 `] <<

Again, we can simplify to see that [`g(-1) = 1 - 3 + 4`], so [`g(-1) = 2`]. In other words, the output of [`g(x)`] is [`2`] when the input is [`-1`].


>> #### Practice #### <<



Use the functions [`f(x)= [$f]`] and [`g(x)= [$g]`] to evaluate the following:
a. [` f([$ax]) = `][_____________________________]{$fax}
b. [` f([$bx]) = `][_____________________________]{$fbx}
c. [` g([$cx]) = `][_____________________________]{$gcx}
d. [` g([$dx]) = `][_____________________________]{$gdx}
e. [` g(a) = `][_____________________________]{$ga}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* Which *function* do you want to evaluate?

* What is your *input*?

* Take your function and replace *each [`x`]* by your input.

* The result is your *output*.

* Simplify your output, if necessary.
