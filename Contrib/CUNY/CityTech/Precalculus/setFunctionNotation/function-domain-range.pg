>> ### The Domain of a Function ### <<

The *domain* of a function [`f(x)`] is defined as "the set of all inputs for the function [`f(x)`] that produce a numeric output." In the graph the domain "lives" in the [`x`]-axis since it consists of inputs. 

* For _linear_ functions such as [` f(x) = 4x + 1`], or _quadratic_ functions such as [` g(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1`], the domain is very boring. _Every_ possible value for [`x`] produces a numeric output value. Try it! No matter what value you "plug in" for [`x`], you will be able to compute an output value for [`f`] or for [`g`]. You can also see this visually. In the pictures below   _any_ vertical line intersects the graphs of [`f`] and [`g`].

>> [@ image( insertGraph($grf), width=>250, 
    height=>175, tex_size=>800 ) @]*  [`\qquad`] [@ image( insertGraph($grg), width=>250, 
    height=>175, tex_size=>800 ) @]*<<

>>Graph of  [`f(x)=4x+1`] [`\hspace{4cm}`] Graph of  [`g(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1`]<<


    In this situation, we say that the domain is [`\mathbb{R}`], which represents "all real numbers".  (Because _all real numbers_ produce a numeric output value.) Or, in interval notation, we say that the domain is [`(-\infty,\infty)`], also representing all real numbers.
    
    Will the domain be [`\mathbb{R}`] for _every_ polynomial function? [_]{$radio}

* The same is not true for _rational_ functions such as [` h(x) = \dfrac{x+1}{x-2} `]. Sure, most [`x`]-values produce numeric outputs - *but* there's one [`x`]-value that fails to produce a numeric output value.

    What happens when we try to evaluate [`h(2)`]?  
>> [` h(2) = \dfrac{2+1}{2-2} `] <<

    What does that simplify to? [` h(2) = \dfrac{3}{0} `], which is undefined. (Because how many times does zero go into three? That question doesn't even make sense.) 
    
    Graphically speaking, this means that the vertical line [`x=2`] does not
    intercept the graph of [`h(x)`].  Notice that it is the only vertical line with this property.

>> [@ image( insertGraph($gr), width=>250, 
    height=>175, tex_size=>800 ) @]*<<

>>Graph of  [`h(x)=\dfrac{x+1}{x-2}`]<<

    In this case, we say that the domain of [`h(x)`] is [`\{x\in\mathbb{R}| x \ne 2\}`], representing all real numbers _except_ for [`x = 2`]. Or in interval notation, we say that the domain is [`(-\infty,2) \cup (2,\infty)`], again representing all real numbers _except_ [`2`].



>> #### Practice #### <<

    For [` f(x) = [$f] `],
[` g(x) = \displaystyle[$g] `] and
[` h(x) = [$h] `],
use interval notation to describe the domain of each function:

a. The domain of [` f(x) `] is [_____]{$fDom}
a. The domain of [` g(x) `] is [_____]{$gDom}
a. The domain of [` h(x) `] is [_____]{$hDom}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* What kind of *function* do you have? Is it a polynomial? Does it have an explicit denominator? Does it have any square roots?

* All *polynomial* functions have the same domain. What is it?

* If you have an *explicit denominator*, which value _can't_ your denominator take?

* If your function has a *square root*,  think about the following questions: what _can_ you take the square root of? what _can't_ you take the square root of? 

* Remember: any number for which you can't evaluate your function at can't be in the domain.

a. The function [` f(x) = [$f] `] is a polynomial. All polynomials have the same domain which is [` [$fDom] `]. We can check this by looking at the graph of [`f(x)`]. Every vertical line intercepts the parabola.  The domain is marked in red.

    >> Graph of  [`f(x)=[$f]`] <<  
    
b. The numerator of [` g(x) = \displaystyle{[$g]} `] is [`[$g2]`], which is a constant and does not depend on [`x`]. The denominator of [`g(x)=\displaystyle{[$g]}`] is [`x-[$g1]`]. We need to make sure that [`x-[$g1]\neq 0`]. 

    >>[`x-[$g1]\neq 0 \quad\implies\quad x\neq [$g1].`] <<
    The domain of [`g(x)`] is [` [$gDom] `].  We can check this by looking at the graph of [`g(x)`].  Notice that the vertical line [`x=[$g1]`] is the only one that does not touch the graph. The domain is marked in red.

c. The function [` h(x) = [$h] `] has a square root which is only defined if [`x - [$h1]\geq 0`].
    >>[`x-[$h1]\geq 0 \quad\implies\quad x\geq [$h1].`] <<
    The domain of [`h(x)`] is [` [$hDom] `].  We can check this by looking at the graph of [`h(x)`].  Notice that every vertical line [`x=a`] with 
[`a<[$h1]`] does not touch the graph. The domain is marked in red.
