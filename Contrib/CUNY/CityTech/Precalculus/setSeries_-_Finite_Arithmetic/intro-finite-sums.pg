BEGIN_PGML

An elementary school teacher, in an attempt to keep a particularly bright student occupied, asked their student to find the sum of the first 100 whole numbers. In other words, they asked the student to find [`1+2+3+\dots+98+99+100`], thinking that this task would keep the student busy for a while.

However, the student was able to provide the correct answer very quickly because he realized the following:

First, he wrote out the sum, then underneath it, he wrote the _same sum_ in *reverse order*:  
>> [` 
\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}
1 &+& 2 &+& 3 &+& \dots &+& 98 &+& 99 &+& 100 \\
100 &+& 99 &+& 98 &+& \dots &+& 3 &+& 2 &+& 1 
\end{array}
`] <<  

He recognized that, vertically, he had pairs of numbers that had the same sum (1 and 100, 2 and 99, 3 and 98, ...); and so he combined the two into a sum of identical values:  
>> [`101+101+101+\dots+101+101+101`] <<

How many pairs do we have that add up to 101? [__________]{$introN}

So, what will be the sum of our 101's? [__________]{$intro101Sum}

To find the original sum, he used the fact that the sum of the 101's came from adding the numbers 1-100 _twice_ (once from 1 up to 100, and once from 100 down to 1). 

Based on the total we got from adding the 101's, what is the sum [`1+2+3+\dots+98+99+100`]? [__________]{$introSum}

>> #### Practice #### <<

Find the sum of all the positive whole numbers from 1 to [$n].

a. If you write the sum forwards _and_ backwards, then pair up the terms - we don't get 101 anymore. What is the sum of each pair? [__________]{$pairs}

b. How many pairs will we have? [__________]{$n}

c. What is the sum of all the pairs? [__________]{$doubleSum}

d. Finally, what is the sum of the positive whole numbers from 1 to [$n]? [__________]{$sum}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Writing the sum _forwards_, we would start with 1.

Writing the sum _backwards_, we would start with [$n].

How much will our pairs add up to then?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. We write out the sum with the numbers in order, [`1`] through [`[$n]`].
On the next row, we write the same sum in reverse order from [`[$n]`] down to [`1`]. Then we add the numbers vertically in pairs: [`1`]+[`[$n]`], [`2`]+[`[$n-1]`], [`3`]+[`[$n-2], \dots`]

>> [` \begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}
1 &+& 2 &+& 3 &+& \dots &+& [$n-2] &+& [$n-1] &+& [$n] \\
[$n] &+& [$n-1] &+& [$n-2] &+& \dots &+& 3 &+& 2 &+& 1  \\ \hline
[$n+1] &|& [$n+1] &|& [$n+1] &|& &|& [$n+1] &|& [$n+1] &|& [$n+1]  \\
\end{array}`] <<

The sum of each pair is [`[$n+1]`].

b. There are [`[$n]`] pairs.

c. The sum of all pairs is [`\underbrace{[$n+1]+[$n+1]+\dots+[$n+1]}_{[$n] \text{ summands}}=[$n]\cdot[$n+1] =[$doubleSum]`].

d. The sum of the positive whole numbers from 1 to [`[$n]`] is [`[$doubleSum]/2 = [$sum].`]
