>> ### Factors of a polynomial ### <<

Find the factors of the polynomial [`f(x)=x^3-3x^2-10x+24`].

* *Step 1*: Find a *root* of [`f(x)`].

Using the graphing calculator, we pick one of the roots, say, for example, [`x=2`].

(Any other root that you can find can be used in a similar way!)

* *Step 2*: *Divide* [`f(x)`] by [`(x-`]root[`)`].

Using a *long-division*, we find that (*check this!*)
[```(x^3-3x^2-10x+24)\div(x-2)=x^2-x-12```] 
(Note that this has remainder [`0`] since [`2`] is a root of [`f(x)`].)

Therefore, [`x^3-3x^2-10x+24=(x-2)\cdot (x^2-x-12)`].

* *Step 3*: Keep *factoring* the quotient.

Factoring [`x^2-x-12=(x+3)(x-4)`] shows that
[```x^3-3x^2-10x+24=(x-2)\cdot (x+3)\cdot (x-4)```] 
The factors of [`f(x)`] are therefore:
[```x-2,x+3,x-4```]
The roots of [`f(x)`] are therefore:
[```2,-3,4```]

>> #### Practice #### <<

Find all factors of the given polynomial.
[```f(x)=[$poly]```]

List all factors of [`f(x)`]: [__________]{$answer}

List all roots of [`f(x)`]: [__________]{$answerRoot}

* Separate multiple factors with commas.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Follow the steps described above:

*Step 1.* Find a root of [`f(x)`] with the graphing calculator.

*Step 2.* Divide [`f(x)`] by [`(x-`]root[`)`] via a long division.

*Step 3.* The quotient from Step 2 is a quadratic polynomial. Find the remaing roots of [`f(x)`] by finding the roots of this quotient.

* If [`c_1`], [`c_2`], [`c_3`] are the roots of [`f(x)`], then [`x-c_1`], [`x-c_2`], [`x-c_3`] are factors of [`f(x)`].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

* *Step 1*: Find a *root* of [`f(x)`].

Using the graphing calculator, we pick one of the roots, say, for example, [`x=[$maa]`].

* *Step 2*: *Divide* [`f(x)`] by [`([$maafactor])`].

Using a *long-division*, we find that (*check this!*)
[```([$poly])\div([$maafactor])=[$quotientsol]```] 
(Note that this must have a remainder of [`0`] when [`[$maa]`] is a root of [`f(x)`].)

Therefore, [`[$poly]=([$maafactor])\cdot ([$quotientsol])`].

* *Step 3*: Keep *factoring* the quotient.

Factoring [`[$quotientsol]=([$mbbfactor])([$mccfactor])`] shows that
[```[$poly]=([$maafactor])\cdot ([$mbbfactor])\cdot ([$mccfactor])```] 
The factors of [`f(x)`] are therefore:
[```[$maafactor],[$mbbfactor],[$mccfactor]```]
The roots of [`f(x)`] are therefore:
[```[$maa],[$mbb],[$mcc]```]
