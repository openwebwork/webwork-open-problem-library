BEGIN_PGML

[`f(x)`] is an unspecified function. You know [`f(x)`] has domain [`(-\infty,\infty)`], and you are told that the graph of [`y = f(x)`] passes through the point [`([$a],[$fa])`].

1. If you also know that [`f`] is an even function, then [`y = f(x)`] must also pass through what other point? [_____]{Point(-$a,$fa)}

1. If, instead, you know that [`f`] is an odd function, then [`y = f(x)`] must also pass through what other _two_ points? [_____]{List(Point(-$a,-$fa),Point(0,0))}

* Write your answer in [`(x,y)`] coordinates.

* For multiple points, separate your answer with a comma.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* [`f(x_0)=y_0`] means that [`(x_0,y_0)`] is a point on the graph.

* When [`f`] is an even function, then [`f(-x_0)=f(x_0)=y_0`]. What point does this correspond to on the graph?

* When [`f`] is an odd function, then [`f(-x_0)=-f(x_0)=-y_0`]. What point does this correspond to on the graph?

* When [`f`] is an odd function and [`0`] is in the domain, then [`f(0)=f(-0)=-f(0)`]. So, what number can [`f(0)`] possibly be?

END_PGML_HINT

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

1. When [`f`] is even, then we get [`f(-[$a])=f([$a])=[$fa]`]. Therefore, we have the additional point [`(-[$a],[$fa])`].

1. When [`f`] is odd, then we get [`f(-[$a])=-f([$a])=[$mfa]`]. Therefore, we have the additional point [`(-[$a],[$mfa])`]. Moreover, since [`f(0)=f(-0)=-f(0)`] we get that [`f(0)`] must be [`0`], and we also know that [`(0,0)`] is a point on the graph. (Note that this is only true when [`0`] is in the domain of [`f`].)
