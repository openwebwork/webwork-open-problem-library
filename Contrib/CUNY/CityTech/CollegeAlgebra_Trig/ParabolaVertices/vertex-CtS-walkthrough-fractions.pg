Use the _complete the square_ method to find the vertex of the following parabola:

[` \large{ [$LHS] = [$RHS] } `]  

END_PGML

Scaffold::Begin();
Section::Begin("Step 1: Separate non-x-terms from x-terms");
BEGIN_PGML

Manipulate the equation until all terms containing _x_ are on one side of the equation, and all terms *not* containing _x_ are on the opposite side:

What value completes the perfect square trinomial? [` \large{ [$RHS1] + } `] [_____]{$CtS}

END_PGML

Section::Begin("Step 3: Complete the Square");
BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ [$LHS1] = [$RHS1] } `]

Add [$CtS] to both sides to complete the perfect square trinomial.

BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ y = [$ans] } `]

Try to determine the vertex just by thinking about how the graph of this equation is a shifted version of [` y = x^2 `]. 
    The vertex of [` y = x^2 `] is [` (0,0) `], what would the new vertex be after applying the shifts?

Otherwise, identify the values of _h_ and _k_ in our equation by comparing our equation to the form [` y = (x-h)^2 + k `]. 
    (_Remember that expressions like [` x+1 `] can be re-written as [` x - (-1) `] and expressions like [` x - 1 `] can be re-written as [` x + (-1) `]_)

The vertex of our parabola will be [` (h,k) `].

What is the vertex of [` y = [$ans] `]? [__________]{$vertex}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

For _Step 1_, [@ ($C>0)?"subtract":"add" @] [`[$absC]`] on both sides.

For _Step 2_, determine a value for the constant term that will make [`[$RHS1]`] into a perfect square trinomial: [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 `].

For _Step 3_, the square was completed on the right side of the equation.  
    Look at how the right side of the equation was changed,  
    do the same on the left side of the equation to keep it balanced.

For _Step 4_, do _NOT_ just isolate [`y`].  
    **Factor the perfect square _first_.**  
    Remember that [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 = (x + A)^2 `]  
    _Then_ you can solve for [`y`].

For _Step 5_, now that you have the equation in vertex form,  
    you should be able to determine the value of [`h`] and [`k`].

You might need to rewrite your additions or subtractions to match vertex form.

[` y = ( x - h )^2 + k `]

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For _Step 1_, [@ ($C>0)?"subtract":"add" @] [` [$absC] `] on both sides.  
    [` ([$LHS]) [@($C>0)?"-$Ctex":"+$absCtex"@] = ([$RHS]) [@($C>0)?"-$Ctex":"+$absCtex"@]`]  
    [` [$LHS1] = [$RHS1] `]

For _Step 2_, if [` [$RHS1] `] is going to look like [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 `],  
then [` 2Ax `] will match [` [$B]x `] when [` A `] is [@-$h@],  
which means we need [` A^2 `] to complete the square.  
    [` A^2 = [$CtS] `]  
    And [` x^2 + [$B]x + [$CtS] `] is our completed square.
  
For _Step 3_,we complete the square by adding [` [$CtS] `] to both sides:  
    [` ([$LHS1]) + [$CtS] = ([$RHS1]) + [$CtS] `]  
    [` [$LHS2] = [$RHS2] `]  

For _Step 4_, we factor the left side first:  
    [` [$LHS2] = [$RHS2] `]  
    [` [$LHS2] = (x-[$h])^2 `]  

Then we solve for y:  
    [` [$LHS2] = (x-[$h])^2 `]  
    [` y = [$ans] `]  

For _Step 5_, identify [`h`] and [`k`]:  
    [` y = [$ans] `]  
    [`\displaystyle y = \left( x - ([$h]) \right)^2 + ([$k]) `]  

So [` h = [$h] `] and [` k = [$k] `].

Our vertex is [`([$h],[$k])`].
