BEGIN_PGML

The population of [$country[$i]] can be modeled by the function

>> [`` P(t) = [$pop[$i]] ( 1 + [$rate[$i]] )^t ``] <<  

where [` P(t) `] measures the population in millions and [` t `] represents the number of years since 2000.

1. Using this model, what was the population of [$country[$i]] in [$pastYr]? [____________]

1. Predict the population of [$country[$i]] in [$futureYr]. [____________]

1. If this growth rate continues, in what year will the population of [$country[$i]] reach 2 billion people? [______]  

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
  
**Hints:**
* [` P(t) `] measures the population in _millions_ from the year 2000. So in 2000, [` t = 0 `], and we get [` P(0) =  [$year0] `] - but that's the population in _millions_. The actual population is [$year0actual].
* Be careful when dealing with decimal answers for the last part. Does it make a difference if the population hits 2 billion in January or December of a given year?
* Recall the change of base formula for logarithms: [` \log_b(A) `] can be calculated as [`` \frac{\ln(A)}{\ln(b)} ``]
