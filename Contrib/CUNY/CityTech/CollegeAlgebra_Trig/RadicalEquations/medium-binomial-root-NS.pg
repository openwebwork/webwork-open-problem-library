BEGIN_HINT

When solving equations that involve square roots, try isolating the radical term $BITALIC first $EITALIC. 
$PAR
Then you can square both sides of the equation in order to eliminate the radical.
$PAR
Always make sure that your final answer works as a solution to the $BITALIC original $EITALIC equation!

END_HINT
BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Isolate the radical: $EBOLD $BR
\( \left( \sqrt{$rad} + $D \right) - $D = (0) - $D \) $BR
\( \sqrt{$rad} = -$D \)
$PAR
$BBOLD Square both sides: $EBOLD $BR
\( \left( \sqrt{$rad} \right)^2 = (-$D)^2 \) $BR
\( $rad = $D2 \)
$PAR
$BBOLD Finish solving the equation: $EBOLD $BR
\( \left( $rad \right) - $B = ($D2) - $B \) $BR
\( $A x = $D2mB \) $BR
\( \displaystyle \frac{$A x }{$A} = \frac{$D2mB}{$A} \) $BR
\( x = $X \)
$PAR
$BBOLD Make sure this answer is a solution! $EBOLD $BR
\( \displaystyle $LHSans = $RHS \) ? $BR
\( \displaystyle \sqrt{$radAns} + $D = 0 \) ?
$PAR
This is not true, and we can see from one of our steps above why this answer is not a solution:
$BR
\( \sqrt{$rad} = -$D \)
$PAR
This cannot happen because \( \sqrt{$rad} \) will always be positive.
$BR
There is no possible way for \( \sqrt{$rad} \) to be equal to \( -$D \).
