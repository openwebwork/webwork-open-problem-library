BEGIN_HINT

When solving equations that involve square roots, try isolating the radical term $BITALIC first $EITALIC. 
$PAR
Then you can square both sides of the equation in order to eliminate the radical.
$PAR
END_HINT
BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Isolate the radical: $EBOLD $BR
The radical is already isolated in this equation. $BR
\( \sqrt{$rad} = $C \)
$PAR
$BBOLD Square both sides: $EBOLD $BR
\( \left( \sqrt{$rad} \right)^2 = ($C)^2 \) $BR
\( $rad = $C2 \)
$PAR
$BBOLD Finish solving the equation: $EBOLD $BR
\( \left( $rad \right) - $B = ($C2) - $B \) $BR
\( $A x = $C2mB \) $BR
\( \displaystyle \frac{$A x }{$A} = \frac{$C2mB}{$A} \) $BR
\( x = $ans \)
