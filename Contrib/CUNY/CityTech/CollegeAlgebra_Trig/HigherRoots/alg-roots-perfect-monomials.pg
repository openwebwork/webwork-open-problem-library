BEGIN_HINT

$BBOLD Be careful! $EBOLD $BR
Yes, \( \sqrt[n]{x^n} = x \), but only for positive values of \( x \) and \( x^n \)!
$PAR
Remember that the \(n\)-th power acts differently on negative values, depending on whether \(n\) is even or odd...
$PAR
In the various problems above, replace \(a\) with \(-1\), and see what happens. Do you always get back the \(-1\) that you started with?
$PAR
If you're still stuck, try replacing the \(a\)s with other negative numbers and see what happens...

END_HINT
BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD \(n\)-th powers and \(n\)-th roots behave differently when it comes to negative values of \(a\). $EBOLD
$PAR
Odd powers of \(a\) are positive when \(a\) is positive, and negative when \(a\) is negative.
$BR
Odd roots behave the same way, meaning that \(\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a\) for all values of \(a\).
$PAR
However, even powers of \(a\) are positive no matter whether \(a\) is positive OR negative!
$BR
This means that when \(n\) is even, \(a^n\) will always be positive.
$BR
As a result, \( \sqrt[n]{a^n} \) will also be positive for any value of \(a\).
$PAR
So what does \( \sqrt[n]{a^n} \) simplify to? 
$BR
Do we know of an operation that always gives us the positive version of whatever number we give it?
$PAR
How about absolute value?
$BR
\( \sqrt[n]{a^n} = |a| \) when \(n\) is even.
