BEGIN_PGML

Suppose an investor deposits [$principal] into an account for which interest is compounded [$interval[$i]]. Find the amount of money in the account after [$years] years using the following interest rates.

1. If [` r = [$r1]% `], then the investment is worth [__________] after [$years] years.
1. If [` r = [$r2]% `], then the investment is worth [__________] after [$years] years.
1. If [` r = [$r3]% `], then the investment is worth [__________] after [$years] years.
1. If [` r = [$r4]% `], then the investment is worth [__________] after [$years] years.

* **Round your answers to the nearest cent.**
* **Use a dollar sign to indicate that your answer is a monetary value.**
