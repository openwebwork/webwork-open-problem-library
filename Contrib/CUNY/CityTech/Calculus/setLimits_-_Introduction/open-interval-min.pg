>> ### Approximating a number ### <<

What is the smallest number in the interval [`(3,5)`]? This is an open interval, and it contains all real numbers between [`3`] and [`5`], but different from [`3`] and [`5`]. So [`3`] cannot be the answer.  Is [`3.1`] the smallest number in that interval? If so, there should not be any number between [`3`] and [`3.1`].  How about [`3.01`]? That's smaller than [`3.1`]. Following the same idea, [`3.001`] is even smaller.  We can keep on adding [`0`] in other decimal places to produce numbers that are closer and closer to [`3`] and that is greater than [`3`].  Since this process does not terminate, there is no number that we can say that is the smallest one in the interval [`(3,5)`].

>> #### Practice #### <<

What is the least value you can find in the interval [`[$S]`]?

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* It is an open interval, so you cannot choose [`[$a]`].

* Find a number that is very close to [`[$a]`], but *different* from [`[$a]`]. 

* To get full credit, the absolute value of the difference between your number and [`[$a]`] should be less than [`10^{-7}`].

$ansplus = $a-> value +1e-7;


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

* Any number in the interval [`([$a],[$ansplus])`].
