>> ### Numerically Approximating Limits ### <<

Suppose that [``\lim_{x \to a} f(x)=L``]. This means that as [`x`] gets closer and closer (_but not equal_) to [`a`], the output [`f(x)`] gets closer and closer to [`L`]. To estimate [`L`], choose an [`x`] that is very close to  [`a`], say, smaller than [`a`]. Then calculate [`f(x)`]. Now choose another [`x`] that is even closer to [`a`] and smaller than [`a`], and calculate [`f(x)`].  Repeat this process.  Do you notice the outputs approaching a particular number?  Do the same with values of [`x`] that are very close to [`a`], but greater than [`a`].  Do the outputs approach that same particular number?  If so, you have estimated [`L`]. Otherwise, the limit does not exist.


>> #### Practice #### <<

Evaluating [``\lim_{x \to [$a]} [$f]``].

[$xyTable]***

Based on the above, _estimate_ the value for [``\lim_{x \to [$a]} [$f]``]:  [___________]

* use decimals for all responses.
* because our goal is to "get close," make sure your decimal responses are accurate to at least [@$n+2@] decimal places.
* your final estimate is not expected to have as much "accuracy" - it will only be an estimate.
* if the limit does not exist, enter "DNE".

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* The numbers [`[$x[0]]`], [`[$x[1]]`] and [`[$x[2]]`] approximate [`[$a]`] from the left. As they approach [`[$a]`], what's happening with their outputs, [`f([$x[0]])`], [`f([$x[1]])`] and [`f([$x[2]])`]? 
Are they approaching a specific number? If so, that's an estimate for the left limit.

* The numbers [`[$x[3]]`], [`[$x[4]]`] and [`[$x[5]]`] approximate [`[$a]`] from the right. As they approach [`[$a]`], what's happening with their outputs, [`f([$x[3]])`], [`f([$x[4]])`] and [`f([$x[5]])`]? 
Are they approaching a specific number? If so, that's an estimate for the right limit.

* Are your estimates for the left- and right-limit very close? If so, you have found [`\displaystyle\lim_{x \to [$a]} [$f]`].  If not, the limit does not exist.

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
* For [`f(x) = [$f]`]: 

[$fxTable]***

* The left outputs, [`[$y[0]]`], [`[$y[1]]`] and [`[$y[2]]`], approach [`[$yLimit]`].

* The right outputs, [`[$y[3]]`], [`[$y[4]]`] and [`[$y[5]]`], also approach [`[$yLimit]`].

* We estimate [`\displaystyle\lim_{x \to [$a]} [$f]`] to be [`[$yLimit]`].
