$BR

A projectile is fired from ground level with an initial speed of $v0
m/sec and an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. Use that the acceleration
due to gravity is 9.8 \(m/sec^2\).

$BR
The range of the projectile is \{ans_rule()\} meters.
$BR
The maximum height of the projectile is \{ans_rule(30)\} meters.
$BR
The speed with which the projectile hits the ground is \{ans_rule()\} m/sec.
