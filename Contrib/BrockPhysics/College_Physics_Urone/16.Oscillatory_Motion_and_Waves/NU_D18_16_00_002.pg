a) A spring that has stiffness constant \(224\) N/m rests at its equilibrium length of \(16\) cm. You gently push on the end of the spring, compressing it to a length of \(14\) cm, where you hold the spring at rest. Determine the magnitude of the force that you need to hold the spring at its new length.

You gently push on the end of the spring, compressing it to a length of \(20\) cm, where you hold the spring at rest.
