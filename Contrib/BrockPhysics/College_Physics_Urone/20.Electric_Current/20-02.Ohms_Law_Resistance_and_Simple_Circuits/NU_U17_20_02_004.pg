BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
How many volts are supplied to operate an indicator light on a DVD player that has a resistance of \($R\) \(\Omega\) , given that \($A \, \(\textrm{mA}\) passes through it?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Considering the magnitudes of the resistance and current, do you expect the magnitude of voltage to be large or small?
