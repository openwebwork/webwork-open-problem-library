A man is running on a straight road that makes \($angle\) ° with the train track. The man is running in the direction on the road that is away from the track at a speed of \($speed_man\) m/s. The train is moving with a speed of \($speed_train\) m/s with respect to the track. What is the speed of the man with respect to a passenger sitting at rest in the train?
