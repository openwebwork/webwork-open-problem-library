BEGIN_PGML
This problem is about the _distance between numbers on the number line_.

1. What is the distance between [$a] and [$b] on the number line?

    [_________]{$ans1}

2. What is the distance between [$c] and [$d] on the number line?

    [_________]{$ans2}

3. Write a formula giving the distance between an unknown number [`x`] and [$a] if we know that [`x > [$a]`]:

    [_________]{$ans3}

4. Write a formula giving the distance between an unknown number [`x`] and [$d] if we know that [`x < [$d]`]:

    [_________]{$ans4}

5. Finally, write a formula that will always give the distance between an unknown number [`x`] and [$b] if we do not have any additional 
   information about [`x`]:

    [_________]{$ans5}

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
1. The distance between [$a] and [$b] is simply [`[$b] - [$a] = [$ans1]`].
2. The distance between [$c] and [$d] is simply [`[$c] - [$d] = [$ans2]`].
3. Since the distance between the unknown number [`x`] and [$a] must be _positive_ and [`x > [$a]`], we need to subtract [$a] from [`x`],
   so the answer is [`[$ans3]`].
4. Since the distance between the unknown number [`x`] and [$d] must be _positive_ and [`x < [$d]`], we need to subtract [`x`] from [$d],
   so the answer is [`[$ans4]`].
5. Since we do not know whether [`x`] is less than or larger than [$b], we do not know in which order to subtract the numbers. To make sure the
   distance turns out positive, we have to use absolute value:  the correct answer is [: |x - [$b]| :] or [: |[$b] - x| :].  Because of the absolute value, the order does not matter.

Remember that *distance* between things is never negative!
