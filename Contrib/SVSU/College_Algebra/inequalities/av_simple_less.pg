# Define variables here:

$a = random(1,9,1);
$sol = Interval("(-$a,$a)");

$answer = $sol->cmp()->withPostFilter(AnswerHints(
  Interval("[-$a,$a]") => "The inequality is sharp, the endpoints should not be included!",

# Actual problem goes here:
TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Write the solution of the inequality

>>[::|x| < [$a]::]<<

using *interval notation*.

-----

The solution: [` x \in `] [________]{$answer} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("intervals") @]*

[@ knowlLink(
"Reminder", value => "Absolute value of a number is the *distance* of the number from zero")
@]*
END_PGML

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Since [: |x| :] is the *distance* of [: x :] from 0, the inequality 

>>[:: |x| < [$a] ::]<<

is satisfied by the numbers that are _less than_ [$a] units away from 0.

That means [: x :] must _not be too far to the left_, in other words, [: x > -[$a] :].
At the same time, [: x :] must _not be to far to the right_: [: x < [$a] :].  So [: x > -[$a] :] *and* 
[: x < [$a] :].  That can be written as a single continuing inequality:

>>[:: -[$a] < x < [$a]. ::]<<

In words, [: x :] must be _strictly between_ [: -[$a] :] and [: [$a] :].

In interval notation, this is written as [: x in [$sol] :].
END_PGML_SOLUTION

#hint:
$showHint = 2;

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
The inequality says that the *distance* of [: x :] from 0 is not too large.  That is, [: x :] cannot be too far to the 
left, but *at the same time*, [: x :] cannot be too far to the right!
