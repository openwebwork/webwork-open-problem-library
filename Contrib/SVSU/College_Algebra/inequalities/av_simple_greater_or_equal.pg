# Actual problem goes here:
TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Write the solution of the inequality

>>[::|x| >=[$a]::]<<

using *interval notation*.

-----

The solution: [` x \in `] [________________]{$answer} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("intervals") @]*

[@ knowlLink(
"Reminder", value => "Absolute value of a number is the *distance* of the number from zero")
@]*
END_PGML

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Since [: |x| :] is the *distance* of [: x :] from 0, the inequality 

>>[:: |x| >= [$a] ::]<<

is satisfied by the numbers that are *at least* [$a] units away from 0.

That means [: x :] must either be _at least [$a] units to the left_, in other words, [: x <= -[$a] :],
_or_, [: x :] must be _at least [$a] units to the right_: [: x >= [$a] :].  So [: x <= -[$a] quad :] _or_ 
[: quad x >= [$a] :].  That *cannot* be written as a single continuing inequality, so we have to write it as

>>[:: x <= -[$a] quad ::] *or* [:: quad [$a] <= x ::].<<

In interval notation, this is written as [: x in [$sol] :].
END_PGML_SOLUTION

#hint:
$showHint = 2;

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
The inequality says that the *distance* of [: x :] from 0 is *at least* [$a].
That is, [: x :] must be either far enough to the left, *or* far enough to the right.
END_PGML_HINT
