# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
When looking for a domain of a function, we are always asking the question "What can go wrong while calculating the 
output of the function from a given input?"  We are looking for operations that are not always defined, or that do not always 
produce a real number.

In this function, such operation is the square root.  The number inside the radical symbol cannot be negative.

In this case, it means [: [$a] x + [$b] :] must be greater or equal to 0.  So the domain will consist of all solutions of the
inequality 

>>[`` [$a] x + [$b] \ge 0 ``]<<

Subtracting [$b] from both sides and dividing by [$a] will give us

>>[`` x \ge [$c] ``]<<

In interval notation, this is written as [: x in [[$c], Infinity) :].
END_PGML_SOLUTION

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Is [` \sqrt{[$a] x + [$b]} `] always defined?  Is it always a real number?
END_PGML_HINT
