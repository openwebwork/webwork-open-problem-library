# Actual problem goes here:
TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
The function [`f`] has domain [`[$domf]`], and the function [`g`] is given by

>>[``g(x) = [$gfun]``]<<

Find the domain of [`f \circ g`].  Write your answer in *interval notation*.

The solution: [` x \in `] [________________]{$sol} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("intervals") @]*

END_PGML

# Solution:
#BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
#When looking for a domain of a function, we are always asking the question "What can go wrong while calculating the 
#output of the function from a given input?"  We are looking for operations that are not always defined, or that do not always 
#produce a real number.
#
#In this function, such operation is the square root.  The number inside the radical symbol cannot be negative.
#
#In this case, it means [: [$a] x + [$b] :] must be greater or equal to 0.  So the domain will consist of all solutions of the
#inequality 
#
#>>[`` [$a] x + [$b] \ge 0 ``]<<
#
#Subtracting [$b] from both sides and dividing by [$a] will give us
#
#>>[`` x \ge [$c] ``]<<
#
#In interval notation, this is written as [: x in [[$c], Infinity) :].
