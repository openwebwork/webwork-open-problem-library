# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
When looking for a domain of a function, we are always asking the question "What can go wrong while calculating the 
output of the function from a given input?"  We are looking for operations that are not always defined, or that do not always 
produce a real number.

In this function, there are two such operations: square root and division.  The number inside the radical symbol cannot be negative.  The number in the denominator of a fraction cannot be 0.

In this case, it means [: x + [$a] :] must be greater or equal to 0 **and** [: [$denom] :] must be **different** from 0.  
So the domain will consist of all solutions of the inequality [` x + [$a] \ge 0 `] such that [` [$denom] \neq 0 `].

In order for the square root to be defined, [`x`] has to be greater than or equal to [$c].

In order for the division to work, [` [$denom] \neq 0 `].  To find when [` [$denom] = 0 `], we factor the denominator as 
[` ([$facb])([$facd]) `].  That is equal to zero when [` x = [$b] `] or when [` x = [$d] `].  Since [$d] is already ruled out by the requirement that [` x \ge [$c] `], all we need to do is make sure [` x \neq [$b] `].

In interval notation, this is written as [: x in [[$c],[$b]) U ([$b],Infinity) :].
