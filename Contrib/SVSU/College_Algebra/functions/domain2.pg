# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
When looking for a domain of a function, we are always asking the question "What can go wrong while calculating the 
output of the function from a given input?"  We are looking for operations that are not always defined, or that do not always 
produce a real number.

In this function, there are two such operations: square root and division.  The number inside the radical symbol cannot be negative.  The number in the denominator of a fraction cannot be 0.

In this case, it means [: x + [$a] :] must be greater or equal to 0 **and** [: x - [$b] :] must be **different** from 0.  
So the domain will consist of all solutions of the inequality [` x + [$a] \ge 0 `] such that [` [$denom] \neq 0 `].

That will be all numbers greater than or equal to [$c] **except** [$b].

In interval notation, this is written as [: x in [[$c],[$b]) U ([$b],Infinity) :].

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Is [` \sqrt{[$a] x + [$b]} `] always defined?  Is it always a real number?
