BEGIN_PGML
Two zeros of the polynomial 
[::p(x) = [$poly]::] are [:[$p1]:] and [:[$p2]:].  The other two zeros
are real, but irrational.

The other two zeros are [____________________] and [____________________] [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Use synthetic division to divide [:p:] by the known factors.

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Since [:[$p1]:] and [:[$p2]:] are zeros of [:p:] we can divide by
[:[$known1]:] and [:[$known2]:] using synthetic division.  (We could also divide
by [``([$known1])([$known2]) = [$knownboth]``] using long division.)

We obtain 

>>[``p(x) = ([$known1])([$known2])([$quotient]).``]<<

We can find the zeros of the quadratic factor by the quadratic formula
or by completing the square.  They are

>>[``x= [$a] \pm \sqrt{[$b]}.``]<<
