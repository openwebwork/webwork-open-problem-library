# Actual problem goes here:
TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
For the polynomial [` p(x) = [$poly] `], answer the following questions:

1.  What is the [:y:]-coordinate of the [:y:]-intercept of [:p(x):]?  [:y = :] [______________]{$const}

2.  What is the end behavior of the polynomial?

    a.  As [`x \to -\infty`], [`p(x)`] goes [__]{$popup_left}.
    b.  As [`x \to \infty`], [`p(x)`] goes [__]{$popup_right}.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
You may want to consider the constant term and the leading term.
END_PGML_HINT

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
1.  The [:y:]-intercept of a polynomial function is its constant term.  [$const_str]***

    The [:y:]-intercept is the point [:(0,[$const]):], with [:y:]-coordinate [:[$const]:].

2.  The end behavior of a polynomial is determined by the end behavior of its leading term.
    The leading term of [:p(x):] is [:[$leading]:].  The degree of the leading coefficient (and therefore the degree
    of the whole polynomial) is [$parity]**, and the leading coefficient [:[$a]:] is [$sign]**.

    The polynomial goes **[@ $popup_left->correct_ans() @]* **on the left and **[@ $popup_right->correct_ans() @]* **on the right.
