# Actual problem goes here:
TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Find an equation of the line that passes through [:([$h],[$k]):] and is perpendicular to 

>>[:: [$left] = [$c] ::].<<

-----

The equation: [________________]{$line} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("equations") @]*

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
There are two ways to solve this problem.  One is very fast an easy, the other one is little bit slower.

The slow one goes like this:

We already know a **point** the line must pass through.  If we can figure out the slope of the line, we can use the 
**point-slope form**  [`y - k = m(x-h)`] to find the equation of the line.

Slopes of two perpendicular lines must give us [`-1`] when multiplied: [`m_1 m_2 = -1`].  That means [`m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}`].

One way to find the slope of the given line is to solve for [:y:] to get the line in the slope-intercept form.  Doing so will give us [`m_1 = [$slope]`]. From that, 

>>[`` m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1} = -\frac{1}{[$slope]} = [$slope1]``]<<

Then the equation we are looking for is

>>[`` [$ymk] = [$slope1]\left([$xmh]\right) ``]<<

which can be simplified to [`[$line]`].
