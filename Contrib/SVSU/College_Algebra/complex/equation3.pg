BEGIN_PGML

Find all solutions of the equation [` x^3 = [$a3] `].

Enter the solutions, separated by comma.  Enter NONE if there are no solutions.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
The sum of cubes: [` x^3 + a^3 = (x+a)(x^2 - ax + a^2) `]
The difference of cubes: [` x^3 - a^3 = (x-a)(x^2 + ax + a^2) `]
END_PGML_HINT

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

First move everything to the left side:

[` [$cubes] = 0 `]

Factor the left side using sum of cubes or difference of cubes:

[` ([$cubes1])([$cubes2]) = 0 `]

From the zero product property, either [` [$cubes1] = 0 `] or [` [$cubes2] = 0 `].

The first equation has a single solution [` x = [$a] `], while the second is a quadratic
equation with solutions [` [$s2] `] and [` [$s3] `].
