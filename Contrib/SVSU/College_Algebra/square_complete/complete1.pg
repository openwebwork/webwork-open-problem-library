BEGIN_PGML
Fill in the blanks so that the following complete squares will be correct.

*  [` x^2 + [$b1]x + `][_____]{$d1} [` = (x + `][____]{$a1}[`)^2`]

*  [` x^2 + [$b2]x + `][_____]{$d2} [` = (x + `][____]{$a2}[`)^2`]

*  [` x^2 + [$b3]x + `][_____]{$d3} [` = (x + `][____]{$a3}[`)^2`]

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
When matching 

[`` x^2 + bx + d ``]

with

[`` x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^2 ``]

you can see that [` b = 2a `] and [` d = a^2 `].

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

### Part 1 ###

In the equation

*  [` x^2 + \color{red}{[$b1]} x + \color{orange}{d} = (x + a)^2`]

we need to find [`a`] and [`d`].  From the perfect square equation, we know that

*  [` x^2 + \color{red}{2a} x + \color{orange}{a^2} = (x + a)^2`]

By comparing the two equations, we see that [` 2a = [$b1] `] and [` d = a^2 `]

First we need to find [`a`]: 

[` a = \frac{[$b1]}{2} = [$a1] `]

Then [` d = a^2 = \left([$a1]\right)^2 = [$d1] `]

### Part 2 ###

In the equation

*  [` x^2 + \color{red}{[$b2]} x + \color{orange}{d} = (x + a)^2`]

we need to find [`a`] and [`d`].  From the perfect square equation, we know that

*  [` x^2 + \color{red}{2a} x + \color{orange}{a^2} = (x + a)^2`]

By comparing the two equations, we see that [` 2a = [$b2] `] and [` d = a^2 `]

First we need to find [`a`]: 

[` a = \frac{[$b2]}{2} = [$a2] `]

Then [` d = a^2 = \left([$a2]\right)^2 = [$d2] `]

### Part 3 ###

In the equation

*  [` x^2 + \color{red}{[$b3]} x + \color{orange}{d} = (x + a)^2`]

we need to find [`a`] and [`d`].  From the perfect square equation, we know that

*  [` x^2 + \color{red}{2a} x + \color{orange}{a^2} = (x + a)^2`]

By comparing the two equations, we see that [` 2a = [$b3] `] and [` d = a^2 `]

First we need to find [`a`]: 

[` a = \frac{1}{2}[$b3] = [$a3] `]

Then [` d = a^2 = \left([$a3]\right)^2 = [$d3] `]
