BEGIN_PGML
First, fill in the following table, using [`x`] for the number of child tickets:

[$table1]*

#  Answer evaluation

ANS( $answer1->cmp() );
ANS( $answer2->cmp() );
ANS( $answer3->cmp() );
ANS( $answer4->cmp() );
ANS( $answer5->cmp() );
ANS( $answer6->cmp() );
ANS( $answer7->cmp() );
ANS( $answer8->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The first column of the table is easy to fill in, just put down the price of
the adult tickets and the price of the child tickets. 

In the second column, the number of child tickets will be [`x`], and since the
total number must be [$totalnum], the number of adult tickets will be [$answer2].

To get the last column, simply multiply the first and second column (revenue =
price times quantity).

The table will look like this:

[$table2]*

Section::Begin("Part 2: Solve the equation");

BEGIN_PGML

Using the table, set up the equation, solve it and find the answer.

The number of child tickets is [__________]{$numberlow}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In the last column of the table, the revenue for adult tickets plus the revenue
for the child tickets must be equal to the total revenue, which is given.  From this we get the equation

[``[$answer3] + [$answer6] = [$answer8]``]

Solving the equation will give us [`x = [$numberlow]`].
