First, fill in the following table, using [`x`] for the amount invested in the first account.

[$table1]*

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The first column of the table is easy to fill in, just put down the rate of
the adult tickets and the rate of the child tickets. 

In the second column, the number of child tickets will be [`x`], and since the
total number must be [$total], the number of adult tickets will be [$answer5].

To get the last column, simply multiply the first and second column (revenue =
rate times quantity).

The table will look like this:

[$table2]*

Section::Begin("Part 2: Solve the equation");

BEGIN_PGML

Using the table, set up the equation, solve it and find the answer.

The amount invested into the first account is [__________]{$x} while 
the amount invested in the second account is [__________]{$total-$x}.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In the last column of the table, the interest from the first account plus the interest from the second account 
must be equal to the total interest, which is given.  From this we get the equation

[``[$answer3] + [$answer6] = [$answer8]``]

Solving the equation will give us [`x = [$x]`], which will be invested in the
first account.  Then we subtract that from [$total] to get [$total - $x] to get the amount
invested in the second account.
