First, fill in the following table, using [`x`] for the amount of [$p1]% solution.

[$table1]*

ANS( $answer2->cmp() );
ANS( $answer3->cmp() );
ANS( $answer5->cmp() );
ANS( $answer6->cmp() );
ANS( $answer8->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In the second column, the amount of [$p1]% solution will be [`x`], and since the
total amount of the desired solution must be [$amount], the amount of the [$p2]% solution will be [$answer5].

To get the last column, simply multiply the first and second column (amount of pure [$chem] = concentration times the amount of solution).

The table will look like this:

[$table2]*
>> (All amounts are in [$unit]) <<

Section::Begin("Part 2: Solve the equation");

BEGIN_PGML

Using the table, set up the equation, solve it and find the answer.

The amount of [$p1]% solution is [__________]{$x} while 
the amount of [$p2]% solution is [__________]{$amount-$x}.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In the last column of the table, the amount of pure [$chem] in the [$p1]% solution plus the 
amount of pure [$chem] in the [$p2]% solution must be equal to the amount of pure [$chem] in 
the mixture of the two solutions, which is [$answer8] [$unit].

[``[$answer3] + [$answer6] = [$answer8]``]

Solving the equation will give us [`x = [$x]`], which is the amount of the [$p1]% solution needed.
Then we subtract that from [$amount] to get [$amount - $x], which is the amount of [$p2]% solution needed.
