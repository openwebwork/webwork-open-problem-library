The following problems are written by Kyle Schlitt at Thompson Rivers University.

### comparingSimpleCompound.pg

Students are given two interest options, one simple and the other compound with a slightly lower rate.  They are asked to determine which gives the better return.  They are also asked to calculate specific returns to prevent them from getting full credit by simply guessing.

### convenienceStore.pg

Two data points are given with respect to the relationship between the price per unit of an energy drink and consumer demand.  Students are asked to construct the equation that describes the complete relationship between price and demand, using the given assumption that it is linear, and then making predictions.

### domainsInterceptsRationalFunction.pg

Students are given a rational function and asked to classify it as such using a drop down menu.  They are then asked to express its domain using interval notation and find all of its intercepts.

### maximizeQuadraticProfit.pg

The cost function and demand equation of a product are both given, and students are asked to find their revenue and profit functions, along with their domains.  They are asked to use these functions to find the break-even quantities, as well as which level of production will maximize profit.  They then use the demand equation to choose the optimal price for the product.  Two hints are given.

### parabolaFeatures.pg

A quadratic function is given, and students are asked to describe its graph using pulldown menus and determine all of its key features -- axis of symmetry, vertex, x-intercepts, and range expressed as an interval.

### shoeSalesman.pg

Parameters are given for a retail product so that students may find the associated cost, revenue, and profit functions.  These functions are then used to answer a sequence of hypothetical questions.

### taxiCompanies.pg

Two taxi companies have different base rates and mileage fees.  Their linear cost functions are then expressed in terms of the distance travelled.  These functions are then used determine the conditions under which each company should be chosen.
