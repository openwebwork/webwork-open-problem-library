BEGIN_TEXT
Several mobsters occupied a cabin of the Orient Express. The cabin had no mirrors for them to check that their eyebrows were on fleek.
When the train entered a tunnel, the lights went out and the conductor noticed a big commotion coming from the cabin. 
When he entered the cabin, he saw that one of the passengers was missing and some of the other passengers had red stains on their faces. 
He was too afraid to point out anybody specifically but he informed the gentlemen that there were washrooms at every train station 
and that the armed security guard would let anybody use those washrooms to clean their faces if there was a visible need for it. 
The wise guys stared at each other silently until the $ii-th stop when a few of them left the 
train to use the station bathroom. How many left the train?
