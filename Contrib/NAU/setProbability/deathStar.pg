BEGIN_TEXT
The VIP cafeteria door on the Death Star promptly opens at 11:00 am and closes at 1:00 pm (Standard Galactic Time). 
Nobody is allowed to enter at other times but guests can stay until they finish their meal. 
To keep their lean physiques, Sith Lords usually spend their allotted $ti-minute lunch break in the cafeteria sipping organic kale smoothies. 
Darth Sidious has a yoga class at 11:00 am, so he never has lunch before noon. 
Darth Vader must use a straw, so he is allowed an additional $inc minutes to slurp his smoothie. 
What is the probability that the two of them meet today in the cafeteria?

$BR 

\( P(\text{meet}) \) = \{ans_rule(30)\}
