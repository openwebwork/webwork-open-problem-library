BEGIN_TEXT

In a small town there are $pop homes.  When it comes to
television viewing, the residents have three choices: they
can subscribe to cable, they can pay for satellite service,
or they watch no TV.  (The town is sufficiently remote so that an
antenna does not work.)  In a given year, $ctoc$PERCENT of the cable
customers stick with cable, $ctos$PERCENT switch to satellite, and
$cton$PERCENT get
totally disgusted and quit watching TV.  Over the same time period,
$stos$PERCENT of satellite viewers continue with satellite service,
$stoc$PERCENT switch
to cable, and $ston$PERCENT quit watching TV. And of those people
who start the
year not watching TV, $nton$PERCENT continue not watching,
$ntoc$PERCENT subscribe to
cable, and $ntos$PERCENT get satellite service.
The current distribution is
$init1 homes with cable,
$init2 with satellite service, and
$init3 with no TV.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
In one year, the distribution will be: $BR
Number of homes with cable = \{ $cable[0]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with satellite = \{ $sat[0]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with no TV = \{ $none[0]->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
In two years, the distribution will be: $BR
Number of homes with cable = \{ $cable[1]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with satellite = \{ $sat[1]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with no TV = \{ $none[1]->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
In three years, the distribution will be: $BR
Number of homes with cable = \{ $cable[2]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with satellite = \{ $sat[2]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with no TV = \{ $none[2]->ans_rule() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
In four years, the distribution will be: $BR
Number of homes with cable = \{ $cable[3]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with satellite = \{ $sat[3]->ans_rule() \} $BR
Number of homes with no TV = \{ $none[3]->ans_rule() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Let \(A = $trans\) and \(\mathbf{x} = $init\).  Then, we find the
distribution after \(n\) years by finding \(A^n \mathbf{x}\):
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
We have
\[ $trans $init = $res[0] $rd[0]. \]
Thus, after one year
$cabler[0] homes have cable,
$satr[0] have satellite, and
$noner[0] have no TV.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Similarly,
\[ \begin{aligned}
   $trans^2 $init &= $trans $res[0] \\
		  &= $res[1] $rd[1], \end{aligned} \]
and after two years
$cabler[1] homes have cable,
$satr[1] have satellite, and
$noner[1] have no TV.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
After three years
\[ \begin{aligned}
   $trans^3 $init &= $trans $res[1] \\
                  &= $res[2]  $rd[2]. \end{aligned} \]
and after three years
$cabler[2] homes have cable,
$satr[2] have satellite, and
$noner[2] have no TV.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
Finally,
\[ \begin{aligned}
   $trans^4 $init &= $trans $res[2] \\
		  &= $res[3] $rd[3]. \end{aligned} \]
and after two years
$cabler[3] homes have cable,
$satr[3] have satellite, and
$noner[3] have no TV.
