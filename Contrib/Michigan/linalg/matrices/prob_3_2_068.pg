BEGIN_TEXT

The star quarterback of a university football team has decided
to return for one more season. He tells one person, who in
turn tells someone else, and so on, with each person talking to
someone who has not heard the news. At each step in this chain,
if the message heard is "yes" (he is returning) then there is a
$yton$PERCENT chance it will be changed to "no," and if the message
heard is "no," then there is a $ntoy$PERCENT chance that it will be
changed to "yes."  Determine the probability that the $nth person in
the chain hears the correct news.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

The transition matrix is \(A = $trans\), and the initial distribution
is \(\mathbf{x} = $ini\).  The distribution for the \(n\)th person is
in the chain \(A^{$n} \mathbf{x} = $trans^{$n} $init = $ans\).  Thus
the probability that the $nth person in the chain hears the correct news
is $cor = $corper $PERCENT.
