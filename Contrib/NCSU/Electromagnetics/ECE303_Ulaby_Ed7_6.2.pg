The loop in the figure above is in the \(x-y\) plane and \(\textbf{B} = \hat{\bf z} B_0 sin (\omega t) \) with \(B_0\) positive.
What is the direction of \(I\) (\(+\hat{\boldsymbol \phi}\) or \(- \hat{\boldsymbol \phi}\)) at: $BR
(a) \(\omega t=$t1 \pi \), \(I\) is \{$popup1->menu()\} of \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\); $BR
(b) \(\omega t=$t2 \pi /6\), \(I\) is \{$popup2->menu()\} of \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\); $BR
(c) \(\omega t=$t3 \pi /6\), \(I\) is \{$popup3->menu()\} of \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\); $BR
(d) \(\omega t=$t4 \pi /6\), \(I\) is \{$popup4->menu()\} of \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\). $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
\(I=V_{emf}/R\). Since the single-turn loop is not moving or changing shape with time, \(V_{emf}^m=0 V\) and \(V_{emf}=V_{emf}^{tr}\). Therefore, from Eq.(6.8),
\(I=V_{emf}^{tr}/R=\frac{-1}{R}\int_S \frac{\partial \vec{\textbf {x}} }{\partial t} \cdot d \vec{\textbf{s}}\) $BR
If we take surface normal to be \(+\hat{\textbf{z}}\), then the right hand rule gives positive flowing current to be in \(+ \hat{\boldsymbol \phi }\) direction. $BR
\(I=\frac{A}{R}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}B_0 sin (\omega t) =\frac{-AB_0 \omega}{R}cos (\omega t) \ (A) \),  $BR
where \(A\) is the area of the loop.
Note \(A, \omega, R\) are positive quantities. $BR
(a) At \(t=0, cos (\omega t) =1\), so \(I<0\), and the current is flowing in the \(- \hat{\boldsymbol \phi}\) direction (so as to produce an induced magnetic field that oppose \(\textbf{B}\)). $BR
(b) At \(\omega t=$t2 \pi /6, cos (\omega t)>0\), so \(I<0\), and the current is flowing in the \(- \hat{\boldsymbol \phi}\) direction (so as to produce an induced magnetic field that oppose \(\textbf{B}\)). $BR

(c) At \(\omega t=$t3 \pi /6, cos (\omega t)=0\), so \(I=0\), there is no current flow in either direction. $BR
(d) At \(\omega t=$t4 \pi /6, cos (\omega t)<0\), so \(I>0\), and the current is flowing in the \(+\hat{\boldsymbol \phi}\) direction. $BR
