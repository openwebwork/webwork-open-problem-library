This problem is related to Problems 7.10-7.18 in the text.

$PAR
Instructions for forms of answers in differential equation problems:
$BR For second order DEs, the roots of the characteristic equation may be real or complex. If the roots are real, the complementary solution is the weighted sum of real exponentials. Use C1 and C2 for the weights, where C1 is associated with the root with smaller magnitude. If the roots are complex, the complementary solution is the weighted sum of complex conjugate exponentials, which can be written as a constant times a decaying exponential times a cosine with phase. Use C1 for the constant and Phi for the phase.

$PAR All numerical angles(phases) should be given in radian angles (not degrees).
$BR Remember to use  \( u(t) \) in Webwork answers when the solution is for \( t \ge 0\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
Let's review the procedure for solving all differential equations: Find the form of the complementary solution, solve for the particular solution, find the coefficients of the complementary solution as part of the total solution from a system of equations determined by the initial conditions.

To find the form of the complementary solution, we find the roots of the characteristic equation \( \lambda^2 + $b\lambda + $c = 0\).For this example, the roots are real and are given by \( -$r1 \) and \( -$r2 \). This means the complementary solution has the form \( v_c(t) = C_1 e^{-$r1 t} + C_2 e^{-$r2 t} \).
$PAR
To find the particular solution, we know the form of the particular solution is the same as that of the driving function. In this case, it is a constant, \( v_p(t) =  B \). We differentiate the particular solution as needed and substitute into the differential equation. Since \( \dot{v}_p(t) = \ddot{v}_p(t) = 0\), we have the equation, \( $c v_p(t) = $c  B = $A.\) We solve for \( B \) to obtain \(  B = $A/$c = $B.\) The particular solution for a unit step driving function is given on p.378 in the text.
$PAR
Now, we determine the coefficients of the complementary solution. The total solution has the form, \( v_t(t) = C_1 e^{-$r1 t} + C_2 e^{-$r2 t} + $B \), where we are leaving off the step function, \( u(t) = step(t) \) for now. We differentiate the total solution as needed and substitute into the equations for the initial conditions. This gives
$PAR
\( C_1 e^{-$r1 t} + C_2 e^{-$r2 t} + $B|_{t=0} = $y0 \), and
\( -$r1*C_1 e^{-$r1 t} - $r2*C_2 e^{-$r2 t}|_{t=0} = $ydot0 \).
$PAR
So \( C_1 + C_2 = $b1 \) and \( -$r1*C_1 - $r2*C_2 = $b2 \). This is a linear system of equations for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \). We can write \( C_2 \) in terms of \( C_1 \) as \( C_2 = $b1 - C_1 \), then substitute \( C_2 \) into the derivative equation, and obtain
$PAR
\( -$r1*C_1 - $r2*($b1 - C_1) = $b2 \), therefore \( C_1 = $D1 \), and (substituting back into \( C_1 + C_2 = $b1 \) ), \( C_2 = $b1 - $D1 = $D2 \).
$PAR
Substituting into the total solution and including the step function, we have
$PAR
\( ($D1 e^{-$r1 t} + $D2 e^{-$r2 t} + $B)u(t) \)
