A set of crash tests consist of running a test car moving at a speed of \{  spf( $VEL    , "%0.1f" ) \} \{ $mPs_u \} into a solid wall.  Strapped securely in an advanced seat belt system, a \{  spf( $M    , "%0.0f" ) \} \{ $kg_u \} dummy is found to move a distance of \{  spf( $D    , "%0.2f" ) \} \{ $m_u \} from the moment the car touches the wall to the time the car is stopped.  How big is the average force (in \{ $N_u \}) which acts on the dummy during that time?

## 
CAPA_hint( "The force that acts on the dummy has to do (negative) work on the dummy.  It must slow the dummy and stop it. Thus the amount of work equals the kinetic energy of the dummy. From the equation of work done by a force we can calculate that force. ");

Using the direction of motion as the positive direction, calculate the average acceleration of the dummy during that time (in \{ $mPs2_u \}).

In a different car, the distance that the dummy moves while being stopped is reduced from \{  spf( $D    , "%0.2f" ) \} \{ $m_u \} to \{  spf( $S    , "%0.2f" ) \} \{ $m_u \}.  What is the average force on the dummy as that car stops (in \{ $N_u \})?
