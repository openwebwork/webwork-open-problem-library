This WebWork site contains the library of mechanics problems originally
developed for use with the CAPA system
Problems in set 01 -- set 30 have been tested and should be free of
bugs.
Problems in set 32 -- set 47 have not been completely tested and may
contain bugs (these are problems in fluids, gases and thermodynamics).
Only the following problems in set 32 -- set 47 have been tested:
set35: 1
set36: 1,2

set37: 1

set38: 2,4,7,10
set39: 2,6
set40: 3,7

set41: 9
set42: 1,6
set43: 1

set45: 7
set47: 3
 

You may login using the username/password pair: practice1/practice1
This will allow you to test the problems without having your answers
recorded for grading.
(if that is busy, practice2 -- practice10 also work)
