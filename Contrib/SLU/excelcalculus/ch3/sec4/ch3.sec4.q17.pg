BEGIN_TEXT

With rental property, a simplified model of costs spreads the purchase cost over the time that the property is held and assume that repair costs will rise the longer the property is held. This gives a formula for annual expenses as
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(AnnualExpense(t)=(PurchasePrice)/t+RepairFactor*t^r\)
$BR
$ECENTER
$BR
where r is a positive number that depends on the type of property. Assume for carpet cleaners that the replacement cost is $\($a\), that the repair costs in the first year are $\($b\) and \(r=1\). Find the length of time the property should be held to minimize the annual expense.
$BR
\{ans_rule()\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

In this instance the Annual Expense function is
$BR
$BCENTER
$BR
\(AnnualExpense(t)=$annexpense\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
Note that the function is not defined when \(t=0\). So we will graph the function and the derivative for \(1\leq t \leq 20\). The property should be held for \($critpoint\) years.
