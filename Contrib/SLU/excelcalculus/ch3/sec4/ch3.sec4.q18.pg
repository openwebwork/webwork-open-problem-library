BEGIN_TEXT

With rental property, a better model factors in the depreciation of the property and how much can be recovered by selling the property used. If we use a 5 year straight line depreciation the formula becomes
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(AnnualExpense(t)=(PurchasePrice*(1-0.2t))/t+FirstYearRepairCost*t^r\)
$BR
$ECENTER
$BR
where r is a positive number that depends on the type of property. Assume for carpet cleaners that the replacement cost is $\($a\), that the repair costs in the first year are $\($b\) and \(r=1\). Find the length of time the property should be held to minimize the annual expense.
$BR
\{ans_rule()\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

In this instance the Annual Expense function is
$BR
$BCENTER
$BR
\(AnnualExpense(t)=$annexpense\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
Note that the function is not defined when \(t=0\). So we will graph the function and the numerical derivative for \(1\leq t \leq 20\), then use Goal Seek to find when the derivative is 0. The property should be held for \($critpoint\) years.
