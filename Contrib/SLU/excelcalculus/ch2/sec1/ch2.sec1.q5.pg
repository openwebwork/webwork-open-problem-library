BEGIN_TEXT

I am given \(p=$a q+$b\) and \(p=$c q+$d\), as my supply and demand curves, but I am not told which is which.
$BR
$BR
Determine which curve is the supply curve \{ $popup->menu() \}.
$BR
Explain how you did it.
$BR
\{ $popup2->menu() \}.
$BR
$BR
What limits can you put on the domain of the supply and demand functions?  Note that the prices need to be positive. Put your answer in the form of an inequality of q.  (i.e. \  (i.e. \(-1<q<1\)). 
\{ans_rule()\}
(If the problem is impossible, answer NONE.)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The supply function is always increasing (positive slope) and the demand function is always decreasing (negative slope), so we have:
$BR
$BCENTER
\(demand: p=$a q+$b\)
$BR
\(supply: p=$c q+$d\)
$ECENTER
$BR
We expect both functions to be positive, because negative prices would indicate we would have to actually give people money to take our product off our hands!
$BR
$BCENTER
\($a q+$b>0\) implies \(q<-1*$b/$a\)
$BR
\($c q+$d>0\) implies \(q>-1*$d/$c\)
$ECENTER
$BR
So we should only consider q when \($ans\).
