BEGIN_TEXT

For this problem you need to know the formula for the price of a zero coupon bond given the face value, the interest rate, and the time to maturity. For such instruments we use the formula 
$BR
$BCENTER
\(Cost=\frac{FaceValue}{(1+rate)^{years}}\)
$ECENTER
$BR
(Be aware the a rate of \($b\)% is a rate of \($help\).) 
$BR
$BR
The face value of the bond is $\($a\). The interest rate is is currently \($b\)%. The bond matures in \($c\) years.
$BR
$BR
a. Give the cost of the bond as described. \{ans_rule\}
$BR
$BR
b. Give the first derivative of cost as a function of rate, evaluated at %\($b\). (This measures risk of interest rate change.) \{ans_rule\}
$BR
$BR
c. Give the second derivative of cost as a function of rate, evaluated at %\($b\). (This measures the value of an option on the bond.) \{ans_rule\}
