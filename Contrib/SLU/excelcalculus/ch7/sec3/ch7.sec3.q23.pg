From experience, I expect the marginal revenue for my firm to be a quadratic function. I have the following data on revenue at a variety of levels, with production in thousands of units and marginal profit in millions of dollars.
$BR
$BR
\{ 
begintable(5) .
row( "Production", "4.90", "7.04", "9.00" ,"11.03","14.00") .
row( "MProfit", "7.40", "9.12", "9.90" ,"9.89","8.40") .
endtable(); 
\}

What is the expected change in revenue as I increase production from 15 to 20 thousand units?

Using trend line, you get the funtion \($fx\). Integrating from 15 to 20 is \(\approx $ans\).
