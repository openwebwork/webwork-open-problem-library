a. Find a solution with Goal Seek starting with x=0.5. Does this represent an actual solution? \{ $popup1->menu() \}

a. Starting at \(x=0.5\) Goal seek gives a solution of 0.023 (or something lower).  This represents the actual solution that occurs when x=0.
$BR
$BR
b. Starting at \(x=2\) Goal seek gives a solution of 3.048 (or something higher).  This does not represent an actual solution, but only the fact that the function gets close to zero.
