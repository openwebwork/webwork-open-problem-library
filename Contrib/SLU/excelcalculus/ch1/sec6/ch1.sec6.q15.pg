a. For \(x=1\) as the starting point GoalSeek find a zero at \(x\approx $ansa\).
$BR
$BR
b. Starting at \(x=2\) GoalSeek does not find a zero at all. If we run GoalSeek a second time, now starting with the value at \(x=53.02\) we zoom in on the first zero!
$BR
$BR
c. Using Wolfram, we see a fairly complicated solution, but we are also shown that there is one real solution.
$BR
$BR
Looking at the graph we see that there is clearly only one solution to the equation \((10x-1)*exp(-x)+2=0\)  f we start Goalseek at \(x=2\), the graph is sloping down to the right, which is why Goalseek approximates the zero to be at about =53. The graph looks to be asymptotically approaching the x-axis. In this case Wolfram would have given the correct answer a bit more easily.
