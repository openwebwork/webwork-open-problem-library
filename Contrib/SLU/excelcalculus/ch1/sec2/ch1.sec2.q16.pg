BEGIN_TEXT

I want a model for the amount I expect to be able to withdraw from an account at a future date, assuming that interest is compounded continuously and at a fixed rate.
$BR
$BR
For the situation above:
$BR
a. Choose which model you would use for the situation (linear, quadratic, etc.).
$BR
\{ $popup1->menu() \}
$BR
$BR
b. What you are using as the free variable (the equivalent of x) 
$BR
\{ $popup2->menu() \}
$BR
$BR
What you are using as the dependent variable (the equivalent of y)
$BR
\{ $popup3->menu() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

Using an exponential model we have \(amountAvailable=initialAmount*e^{rate*years}\)
$BR
$BR
Years is the free variable (the input) and amount available is the dependent variable (the output).
