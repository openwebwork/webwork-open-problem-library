BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose we are working with a quadratic model, \(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\)
$BR
a. How do we get a graph, that points down? (i.e. a graph that has a maximum)?
$BR
\{ $mc1->menu() \}
$BR
b. How will we know if the graph of the function intercepts the x-axis at two positive values?
$BR
\{ $mc2->menu() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

In order to get a graph that to point down, we need \(a<0\)
$BR
$BR
To make sure the graph intercepts the x-axis at two positive values two things need to happen. The vertex, \(\frac{-b}{2a}\), needs to be positive, so \(ab\) needs to be negative.  We also need \(\sqrt{b^2-4ac}\) to be positive and less than the absolute value of \(b\). Hence \(0<4ac<b^2\).
