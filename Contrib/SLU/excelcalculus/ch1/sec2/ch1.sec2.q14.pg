BEGIN_TEXT

The cost of producing an amount of a product is the sum of the fixed costs, like warehouse rent, and the variable costs, like labor and materials, which we can assume to be the same for each unit produced.

For the situation above:
$BR
a. choose which model you would use for the situation(linear, quadratic, etc.).
$BR
\{ $popup1->menu() \}

b. What you are using as the free variable (the equivalent of x)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

The cost of producing an amount of a product is the sum of the fixed costs, like warehouse rent, and the variable costs, like labor and materials, which we can assume to be the same for each unit produced.
$BR
$BR
Using a linear model we have cost=(fixed costs)+(variable costs)*(units produced). Units produced is the free variable (the input) and cost is the dependent variable (the output).
