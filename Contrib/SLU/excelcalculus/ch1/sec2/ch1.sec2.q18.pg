BEGIN_TEXT

I want to model the amount of electricity needed for air conditioners in a Washington, D.C. at various times of the year.
$BR

For the situation above:
$BR
a. Choose which model you would use for the situation (linear, quadratic, etc.).
$BR
\{ $popup1->menu() \}
$BR
$BR
b. What you are using as the free variable (the equivalent of x) 
$BR
\{ $popup2->menu() \}
$BR
$BR
What you are using as the dependent variable (the equivalent of y)
$BR
\{ $popup3->menu() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:${PAR}

We have a sinusoidal model for temperature and for air conditioner electricity. 
$BR
$BR
Time since the beginning of the year is the free variable and amount of electricity is the dependent variable.
