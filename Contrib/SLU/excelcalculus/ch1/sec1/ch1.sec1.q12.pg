Given a line with a slope that is undefined, passing through \(($x1,$y1)\), in the \((q,p)\) plane, with \(q_0=$q0\).
$BR
a. Give the equation of the line determined by this information: q=
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
b. Explain why the following question would not make sense. "Using the line, give the predicted value of \(p\) for the given \(q_0\)":
$BR
$BR
\{ $popup1->menu() \}
$BR

c. Give the value of \(q\) for which the predicted value for \(p\) is \(0\):
\{ ans_rule(20) \}

a. The equation to the line is \(q=$answer1\).
$BR
$BR
b. The predicted value of q is never 0, because the predicted value of q is always \($x1\).
$BR
$BR
c. When \(p=0\), we get that \(q=$x1\). (This is a constant function, and the output is going to be \($x1\) no matter what value of q we plug in.)
