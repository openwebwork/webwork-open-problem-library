BEGIN_PGML
Consider the sequence [`[$a1], [$a2], [$a3], [$a4], [$a5], \ldots`] with [`a_1 = [$a1]`].

a. [@ $mc -> print_q() @]*
[@ $mc -> print_a() @]*


a.  Give a closed formula for the [`n`]th term of the sequence.

    [`a_n = `] [_____]


a. [@ $mc2 -> print_q() @]*
[@ $mc2 -> print_a() @]*

a. How many terms does the finite sequence [`[$a1], [$a2], [$a3], [$a4], [$a5], \ldots, [$last]`] have?

    [_____]


a.  Find the sum: [`[$a1] + [$a2] + [$a3] + [$a4] + [$a5] + \cdots + [$last]`]

    [_____]


a.  Use what you found above to find [`b_n`], the [`n`]th term of [`[$b0], [$b1], [$b2], [$b3], [$b4], \ldots`] where [`b_0 = [$b0]`].

    [`b_n = `][_____]

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

This is an arithmetic sequence with initial term [$a1] and common difference [$rate].

For the last part, you are finding the sequence of partial sums, added to [$b0].
