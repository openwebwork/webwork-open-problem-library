BEGIN_PGML
How many anagrams are there of "[$word]"?

[_____]{$ans}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First, decide where to put the "[$letter]"s. There are [$wlength] positions, and we must choose 3 of them to fill with an "[$letter]". This can be done in [`\binom{[$wlength]}{3}`] ways. The remaining [$others] spots all get a different letter, so there are [`[$others]!`] ways to finish off the anagram. This gives a total of [`\binom{[$wlength]}{3}\cdot [$others]!`] anagrams. 
Strangely enough, this is [$ans], which is also equal to [`P([$wlength],[$others])\text{.}`] To get the answer that way, start by picking one of the [$wlength] _positions_ to be filled by the first non-"[$letter]" letter, one of the remaining 7 positions to be filled by the next, and so on. Then put "[$letter]"s in the remaining 3 positions.
