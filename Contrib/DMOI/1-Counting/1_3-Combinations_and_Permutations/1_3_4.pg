# Body

BEGIN_PGML
In an attempt to clean up your room, you have purchased a new floating shelf to put some of your [$b] books you have stacked in a corner.  These books are all by different authors.  The new book shelf is large enough to hold [$c] of the books.  Warning: before answering the next two questions, ask yourself which answer should be larger. 
a.  How many ways can you select and arrange [$c] of the [$b] books on the shelf?  Notice that here we will allow the books to end up in any order.  

    [_____]{$ans1}


a.  How many ways can you arrange [$c] of the [$b] books on the shelf if you insist they must be arranged alphabetically by author?  

    [_____]{$ans2}

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a.  We can write the answer as [`P([$b],[$c]) = [$b] \cdot [$b1] \cdot [$b2] \cdot \dots \cdot [$diff1]`] , which is the same as [`\frac{[$b]!}{[$diff]!}`] .  Or, if you think of picking the [$c] books and then arranging those [$c], you can write this as [`\binom{[$b]}{[$c]}\cdot [$c]!`] .  Note, that since any order is acceptable, we are distinguishing between different orders, so a permutation is appropriate here.


a.  Here we just need to select the books, and have no choice as how to arrange them.  So the answer is just [`\binom{[$b]}{[$c]}`]
