BEGIN_PGML
After a late night of math studying, you and your friends decide to go to your favorite tax-free fast food Mexican restaurant, _Burrito Chime_. You decide to order off of the dollar menu, which has [$i] items. Your group has \$[$d] to spend (and will spend all of it).
a.  How many different orders are possible? (The _order_ in which the order is placed does not matter, just which and how many of each item that is ordered.)

    [_____]{$ans1}


a.  How many different orders are possible if you want to get at least one of each item?

    [_____]{$ans2}


a.  How many different orders are possible if you don't want to get more than 4 of any one item?

    [__]{$ans3}{width => 15}

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a.  [`{[$a] \choose [$b]} = [$ans1]`] - there are [$d] stars and [$b] bars.


a.  [`{[$rt] \choose [$b]}= [$ans2]`] - buy one of each item, using \$[$i]. This leaves you \$[$rem] to distribute to the [$i] items, so [$rem] stars and [$b] bars.


a.  [`{[$a] \choose [$b]} - \left[{[$i] \choose 1}{[$a-5] \choose [$b]} - {[$i] \choose 2}{[$a-10] \choose [$b]} + \cdots\right]`] meals.  Use PIE to subtract all the meals in which you get 5 or more of a particular item.
