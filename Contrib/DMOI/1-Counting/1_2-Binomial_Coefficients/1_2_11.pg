BEGIN_PGML
Gridtown USA, besides having excellent donut shops, is known for its precisely laid out grid of streets and avenues. Streets run east-west, and avenues north-south, for the entire stretch of the town, never curving and never interrupted by parks or schools or the like.

Suppose you live on the corner of [$s]th and [$s]th and work on the corner of [$f]th and [$f]th. Thus you must travel [$total] blocks to get to work as quickly as possible.
a.  How many different routes can you take to work, assuming you want to get there as quickly as possible? 

[_____]{$ans1}

a.  Now suppose you want to stop and get a donut on the way to work, from your favorite donut shop on the corner of [$x1]th Ave. and [$y1]th St. How many routes to work, stopping at the donut shop, can you take (again, ensuring the shortest possible route)? 

[________]{$ans2}

a.  Disaster Strikes Gridtown: there is a pothole on [$x2]th Ave. between [$y2]th St. and [$y2+1]th St. How many routes to work can you take avoiding that unsightly (and dangerous) stretch of road? 

[________]{$ans3}

a.  The pothole has been repaired (phew!) and a new donut shop has opened on the corner of [$x2]th Ave. and [$y2]th St. How many routes to work drive by one or the other (or both) donut shops? Hint: the donut shops serve PIE.
