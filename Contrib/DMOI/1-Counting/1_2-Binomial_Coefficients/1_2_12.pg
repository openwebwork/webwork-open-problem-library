BEGIN_PGML
Suppose you are ordering a calzone from _D.P.[$NBSP]*Dough_. You want [$a] distinct toppings, chosen from their list of [$n] vegetarian toppings. 
a.  How many choices do you have for your calzone?

    [_____]{$ans1}


a.  How many choices do you have for your calzone if you refuse to have green pepper as one of your toppings?

    [_____]{$ans2}


a.  How many choices do you have for your calzone if you _insist_ on having green pepper as one of your toppings?

    [_____]{$ans3}


How do the three questions above relate to each other? Do you see why this makes sense?

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a.  [`{[$n] \choose [$a]} = [$ans1]`] choices, since you have to select a [$a]-element subset of the set of [$n] toppings.
a.  [`{[$b] \choose [$a]} = [$ans2]`] choices, since you must select [$a] of the [$b] non-green pepper toppings.
a.  [`{[$b] \choose [$c]} = [$ans3]`] choices, since you must select [$c] of the remaining [$b] non-green pepper toppings to have in addition to the green pepper.

Note that [`[$ans1]  = [$ans2] + [$ans3]`] choices, which makes sense because every [$a]-topping pizza either has green pepper or does not have green pepper as a topping.
