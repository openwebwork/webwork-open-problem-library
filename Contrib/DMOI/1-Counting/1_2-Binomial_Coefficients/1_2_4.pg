BEGIN_PGML
How many [`[$n]`]-bit strings (that is, bit strings of length [$n]) are there which: 
a.  Start with the sub-string 011? 

    [_____]{$ans1}


a.  Have weight [$w] (i.e., contain exactly [$w] 1's) and start with the sub-string 011? 

    [_____]{$ans2}


a.  Either start with [`011`] or end with [`01`] (or both)?

    [_____]{$ans3}


a.  Have weight [$w] and either start with [`011`] or end with [`01`] (or both)? 

    [_____]{$ans4}

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a.  [`2^{[$n3]} = [$ans1]\text{.}`] You have 2 choices for each of the remaining [$n3] bits.


a.  [`{[$n3] \choose [$w2]} = [$ans2]\text{.}`] You need to choose [$w2] of the remaining [$n3] bits to be 1's.


a.  [$ans3]. There are [`2^{[$n3]}`] strings that start with 011, and another [`2^{[$n2]}`] which end with 01 (we choose 1 or 0 for [$n2] bits). However, we count the strings that start with 011 and end with 01 twice - there are [`2^{[$n5]}`] such strings. So using PIE, we have [`2^{[$n3]} + 2^{[$n2]} - 2^{[$n5]} = [$ans3]`]


a.  [$ans4]. There are [`{[$n3] \choose [$w2]} = [$ans2]`] strings of weight [$w] which start with 011, and another [`{[$n2] \choose [$w1]} =[$we] `] which end with 01. We have over counted again - there are weight [$w] strings which both start with 011 and end with 01, in fact [`{[$n5] \choose [$w3]} =[$oc] `] of them. So all together we have [`[$ans2]+[$we]-[$oc] = [$ans4]`] strings.
