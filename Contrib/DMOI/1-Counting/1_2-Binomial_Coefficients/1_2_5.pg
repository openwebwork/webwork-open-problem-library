BEGIN_PGML
You break your piggy-bank to discover lots of pennies and nickels. You start arranging these in rows of [$n] coins. 
a.  You find yourself making rows containing an equal number of pennies and nickels.  For fun, you decide to lay out every possible such row.  How many coins will you need?

    [_____]{$total1}


a.  How many coins would you need to make all possible rows of [$n] coins (not necessarily with equal number of pennies and nickels)?

    [_____]{$ans2}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a.  We can think of each row as a [$n]-bit string of weight [$half] (since of the [$n] coins, we require [$half] to be pennies).  Thus there are [`{[$n] \choose [$half]} = [$ans1]`] rows possible.  Each row requires [$n] coins, so if we want to make all the rows at the same time, we will need [$total1] coins, half of them nickels and half of them pennies.


a.  Now there are [`2^{[$n]} = [$total2]`] rows possible, which is also [`{[$n] \choose 0} + {[$n]\choose 1} + {[$n] \choose 2} +\dots   + {[$n] \choose [$n]}\text{,}`] if you break them up into rows containing 0, 1, 2, etc. pennies.  Thus, since there are [$n] coins in each row, we need [`[$n] \cdot [$total2] = [$ans2]`] total coins.
