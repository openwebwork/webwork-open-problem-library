# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To find out how many numbers strictly less than [$n] are multiples of [$a], we can divide [$n] by [$a] and round down.  There are [$na] of these.  Similarly, there are [$nb] multiples of [$b] and [$nc] multiples of [$c] less than [$n].

We also need the combinations of these.  To be a multiple of [$a] and [$b]  means you are a multiple of [$ab] , and there are [$nab] multiples of [$a] and [$b].  There will be [$nac] multiples of [$a] and [$c].  There will be [$nbc] multiples of [$b] and [$c].  Finally, there will be [$nabc] multiples of all three.

Using PIE, we get

>> [``
              [$na] +[$nb]+ [$nc] - ([$nab] + [$nac] + [$nbc]) + [$nabc] = [$ans]
                ``] <<

multiples of [$a], [$b], or [$c] less than [$n].
