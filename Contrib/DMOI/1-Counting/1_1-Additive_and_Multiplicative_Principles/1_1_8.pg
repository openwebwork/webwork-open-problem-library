BEGIN_PGML
In a recent survey, [$n] students reported whether they liked their potatoes Mashed, French-fried, or Twice-baked. [$m] liked them mashed, [$f] liked French fried, and [$t] liked twice baked potatoes. Additionally, [$mf] students liked both mashed and fried potatoes, [$ft] liked French fries and twice baked potatoes, [$mt] liked mashed and baked, and [$mft] liked all three styles. How many students _hate_ potatoes? Explain why your answer is correct.

[_____]{$ans2}

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Using the principle of inclusion/exclusion, the number of students who like their potatoes in at least one of the ways described is

>> [``
              [$m] + [$f] + [$t] -([$mf] + [$ft] + [$mt]) +[$mft] = [$ans].
            ``] <<



Therefore there are [`[$n] - [$ans] = [$ans2]`] students who do not like potatoes. You can also do this problem with a Venn diagram.
