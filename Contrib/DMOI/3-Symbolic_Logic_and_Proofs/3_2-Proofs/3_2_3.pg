BEGIN_PGML

Consider the statement:
    
[$statement]

First, give a valid proof of the statement using proof by *_contrapositive_*.  Drag [$length1] of the statements below to the right column.

[@ $Proof1->Print @]***

Now prove the statement using a proof by *_contradiction_*.

[@ $Proof2->Print @]***
