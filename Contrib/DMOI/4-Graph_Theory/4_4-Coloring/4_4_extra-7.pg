BEGIN_TEXT
Each of the following problems can be solved by finding either the chromatic number of a graph or the chromatic index of a graph.  
$BR
For each problem, say whether you should find a proper coloring of the vertices or of the edges of the graph to solve the problem.  Note: you likely don't have enough information to actually solve the problem, but this is okay.  Just say in principle whether this is an edge-coloring or vertex-coloring application.
