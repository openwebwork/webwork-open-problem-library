BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you have four cards, each of which has an integer on one side and a letter on the other.  Someone tells you that $BR
if the letter is a vowel, the number is even.  $BR
Right now you can see the following cards: 4, B, E, 7.  To check if the assertion is true, you may need to flip over some cards.  Which cards? $BR $BR

\{$radio2->print_q()\} $BR
\( 4 \)
\{$radio2->print_a()\}

$BR
\{$radio2->print_q()\} $BR
\( B \)
\{$radio2->print_a()\}

$BR
\{$radio1->print_q()\} $BR
\( E \)
\{$radio1->print_a()\}

$BR
\{$radio1->print_q()\} $BR
\( 7 \)
\{$radio1->print_a()\}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
To confirm that the conditional is always satisfied, you must check the situation where the hypothesis is true (to make sure the conclusion is true) and the situation where the conclusion is false (to make sure the hypothesis is false).  The other possibilities don't matter.  $BR
