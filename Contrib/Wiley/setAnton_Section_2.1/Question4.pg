The accompanying figures show the position versus time
curves of four different particles moving on a straight
line. For each particle, determine whether its instantaneous
velocity is increasing or decreasing with time.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The graphs indicate position versus time. Therefore the instantaneous velocity of the particle is
indicated by the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point. If the instantaneous velocity
is increasing the slopes of the tangent lines will increase, and if the instantaneous velocity is
decreasing the slopes of the tangent lines will decrease.
$PAR
(a) If a tangent line is drawn at the leftmost part of the graph, it will have a large positive slope.
As we move to the right, the slopes of the tangent lines will tend towards 0 and therefore be
$BBOLD decreasing $EBOLD.
$PAR
(b) If a tangent line is drawn at the leftmost part of the graph, it will have a small positive slope.
As we move to the right, the slopes of the tangent lines will tend towards infinity and therefore be
$BBOLD increasing $EBOLD.
$PAR
(c) If a tangent line is drawn at the leftmost part of the graph, it will have a large negative slope.
As we move to the right, the tangent lines will tend towards 0 and therefore be
$BBOLD increasing $EBOLD.
$PAR
(d) If a tangent line is drawn at the leftmost part of the graph, it will have a small negative slope.
As we move to the right, the slopes of the tangent lines will be increasingly negative and therefore be
$BBOLD decreasing $EBOLD.
