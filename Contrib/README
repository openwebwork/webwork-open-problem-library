New contributions for the OPL should appear here.  When people
download the OPL, they will get these problems as well, so it
is a means for making problems available to others.

By putting problems in this area, the problem authors are giving
OPL maintains permission to copy problems from this area to the OPL.
The copies are then maintained by the OPL which may modify problems
as needed to blend into the OPL in terms of content and style.

Problem here do not needed to be "tagged" for the OPL.  People using
these contributions from the Contrib directory will be searching by 
subdirectory.  If problems are tagged, it will be of help in merging
them into the OPL in the future.

This directory should have one subdirectory for each problem source,
just as in the OPL.  Please include a README file to specify whom
should be contacted if there are questions about problems in the
subdirectory.
