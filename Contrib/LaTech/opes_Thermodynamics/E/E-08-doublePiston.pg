## NOTES : This is a challenging problem. The solution requires combining 
## ideal gas law behavior with spring work. To work with the two pistons 
## requires that the students understand the true meaning of boundary work 
## (Force over a distance). The force changes linearly, so no integral is 
## needed. However, students must realize that the force on the left piston 
## is the same as the force on the right piston, but that the stroke lengths 
## are different. One path to the correct solution is:
## 1) calculate initial pressure from the force and area
## 2) calculate the initial temperature from the ideal gas law 
## 3) develop an expression for the V2 that is a function of xA and xB
## 4) develop an expression for the P2 that is a function of xB (NOT xA !!!)
## 5) use the ideal gas law (PV/T=PV/T) to develop an expression for T2 that 
##    has only xB as the unknown
## 6) set up the First Law equation [Q-W=mC(T2-T1)]
## 7) develop an expression for both boundary works with xB as only unknown
##    *** CAUTION: the force increases through the stroke equally for both 
##        pistons, but piston A travels xA, while piston B travels xB. 
## 8) set up the First Law Equation with both boundary work expressions and 
## the expression for T2. The only unknown will be xB, but the equation is 
## quadratic.
## 9) solve for xB using the quadratic formula (choosing the positive root)
## 10) substitute this value into the other expressions

NOT COMPLETE YET $PAR
THERE IS STILL AN ISSUE IN THE SOLUTION $PAR

Xenon has one of the lowest thermal conductivities of all gases, and is therefore used in technical applications where heat transfer must be carefully controlled. Consider the machine component shown in this figure. $mass lbm of xenon gas is contained between two pistons of an insulated - and evacuated - cylinder which has an inner diameter of $diameter inches. As one piston is forced against the argon by a distance of $xA inches (labeled as \(x_A\) in the figure), the other piston backs out of the cylinder a distance (labeled as \(x_B\) in the figure). The displacement of this latter piston is resisted by a spring with a force constant of $kSpring lbf/in. At the starting position of the stroke (labeled "initial" in the figure) the specific volume of the xenon was $littlev1 ft\(^3\)/lbm, and the spring was already compressed $initial inches from its zero-force length. $PAR

$PAR

Assume the specific heat (c\(_\text{V}\)) of xenon is 0.2044 \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{Btu}}{\text{lbm}\cdot\text{R}} \)$PAR
