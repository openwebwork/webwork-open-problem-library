** THIS PROBLEM IS NOT COMPLETE **

Near the critical temperature and critical pressure of a gas, it will behave quite like an ideal gas except that its density will be higher than predicted by the Ideal Gas Law. Based on what you know of this "compressibilty" behavior, what will be the volume in \(\displaystyle\text{m}^3\) of $MASS kg of $GAS if it is at a temperature of $TEMP K, and a pressure of $PRESSURE MPa?
