BEGIN_TEXT
A newspaper conducted a statewide survey concerning voter opinion on 
approving tax increases to support extra-curricular activities in high schools.  
The newspaper took a simple random sample of \( n = $n \) registered Idaho voters 
and found that \($s\) would vote in favor of the tax increase.  Let \(p\) 
represent the proportion of registered voters in the state who would vote for 
the tax increase. 
$BR
We test
$BCENTER
\(  H_0: p = .50 \) 
$BR
\( H_a: p > .50\)
$ECENTER
$PAR
(a) What is the \(p\)-value of the test?  
\{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(b) Does this sample provide evidence at \(\alpha = $alpha\)
that over \(50\)$PERCENT of the voters favor the tax increase? 
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
Answer: \{ ans_rule(10) \} ${BITALIC}(Enter: ${BBOLD}YES$EBOLD or ${BBOLD}NO${EBOLD})$EITALIC
