BEGIN_TEXT
In a survey of a local school district, \($p\)$PERCENT of the \($s\) respondents 
between the ages of 18 and 24 said they would vote in favor of the next school bond.  At a \(95\)$PERCENT confidence level, this example has an 
\($e\)$PERCENT margin of error.  Based on the information, determine if the 
following statements are true or false.
$PAR
${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD \{ $popup_a->menu() \}: 
We are \(95\)$PERCENT confident that between \($ci1\)$PERCENT and \($ci2\)$PERCENT of the voters  in the school 
district will support the school bond.
$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD \{ $popup_b->menu() \}:
We are \(95\)$PERCENT confident that between \($ci1\)$PERCENT and \($ci2\)$PERCENT of the voters between the ages of 18 and 24 in the school district will support the school bond. 
$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD \{ $popup_c->menu() \}:
If we considered many random samples of \($n\) voters between the ages of 
18 and 24 in the school district and calculated \(95\)$PERCENT confidence intervals for each, \(95\)$PERCENT of them will include the true proportion of voters between the ages of 18 and 24 in the school district who support the school bond. 
$PAR
${BBOLD}D.$EBOLD \{ $popup_d->menu() \}:
Based on this confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a majority of voters between the ages of 18 and 24 in the school district will support the bond issue.
