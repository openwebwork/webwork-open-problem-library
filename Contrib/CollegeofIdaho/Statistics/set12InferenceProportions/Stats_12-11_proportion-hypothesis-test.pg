BEGIN_TEXT
A newspaper article states that only a minority of adults in Canyon county who 
decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the 
point estimate from this survey as evidence.  Conduct a hypothesis test to 
determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.
$PAR
(a) State the null and alternative hypotheses for testing the newspaper's claim.
$BR
${BITALIC}Note: Type the letter ${BBOLD}p$EBOLD for the population proportion and whichever
symbols you need of ${BBOLD}<${EBOLD} for "less than", ${BBOLD}>${EBOLD} for "greater than", ${BBOLD}=$EBOLD for "equal" or ${BBOLD}!=$EBOLD for "not equal").$EITALIC

Among a simple random sample of \($n\) adults in Canyon county who do not 
have four-year college degrees and are not currently enrolled in school, 
\($s\) said they decided not to go to college because they could 
not afford school.    
$PAR
(b)  Determine the P-value of the 
test: 
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
P-value = \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$PAR
(c) Does this sample provide evidence at \(\alpha = $alpha\)
that the newspaper article is correct?
