$BBOLD This question has two parts.  Please refer to the previous problem for Part 1.$EBOLD
$BR $BR
PART 2:
$BR
During the steelhead fishing season in north central Idaho, fishing enthusiasts flock to the Salmon river.  The fish and game department recorded the distance between fishermen, in yards, on several stretches of river with similar conditions (parking areas, river access, etc).
$BR

For this problem, we are interested in comparing the mean distance between fishermen at the two sites.  In Part 1, you used ${BBOLD}R$EBOLD to find the test statistic.  Use this information to answer the following:

Note: \(t = $stat,\) \(df = $df\) and the 
\(90\)$PERCENT CI is: \($CI1\) to \($CI2\)

(b) ${BBOLD}\{$mc2->correct_ans\}${EBOLD}. We do not know the population standard deviation so the \(z\) statistic is
not appropriate for this situation.
