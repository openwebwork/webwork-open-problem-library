A local third grade teacher asked her students to participate in the summer reading program at the library.  She kept track of the students who participated in the summer program during the next school year.  The table  below shows the number of books read during the summer and the grade they earned in fourth grade Language Arts.

In the previous problem, you used ${BBOLD}R$EBOLD to calculate a \(95\)$PERCENT 
confidence interval for the difference between the mean number of books read 
by students who earned an \(A\) in fourth grade Language Arts and those who 
earned a \(B\) or \(C.\)  Use this information to answer the following:
