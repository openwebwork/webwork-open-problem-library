       average lifetime of \(1200\) hours.  The new bulb had a lifetime of \(1200.2\) hours, 
       using a sample of \(40,000\) bulbs.  Although the difference is quite small, the 
       effect was statistically significant.  The explanation is",

       cigarettes is \(1.5,\) but you believe that the mean nicotine content is actually 
       higher than advertised.  To explore this, you test the hypotheses
       \(H_0: \mu = 1.5\), \(H_a: \mu > 1.5\) and you obtain a \(p\)-value of \(0.052.\)

       for a period of six months.  At the end of the study, \(200\) variables related to 
       the mental performance of the subjects were measured on each subject and the 
       means compared to known means for these variables in the population of all 
       adults.  Nine of these variables were significantly better (in the sense of 
       statistical significance) at the \(\alpha = 0.05\) level for the group that 
       performed \(30\) minutes of aerobic exercise each day as compared to the population 
       as a whole, and one variable was significantly better at the \(\alpha = 0.01\)
