(a) The diameter of a spindle in a small motor is supposed to be \($mu1\) millimeters (mm) 
with a standard deviation of \($sigma1\) mm.  If the spindle is either too small or too
large, the motor will not work properly.  The manufacturer measures the diameter 
in a sample of \($n1\) spindles to determine whether the mean diameter has moved away 
from the required measurement. Suppose the sample has an average diameter of \($xbar1\) mm.

(b) Harry thinks that prices in 
Caldwell are $direction[$choose] than the rest of the country.  He reads that the nationwide average price of a
certain brand of laundry detergent is \($display_mu2\)  with standard deviation
\($display_sigma2.\)  He takes a sample from \($n2\) local Caldwell stores and finds
the average price for this same brand of detergent is \($display_xbar2.\)
