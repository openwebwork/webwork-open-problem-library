#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
One of the most feared predators in the ocean is the great white shark. It is known that the
white shark grows to a mean length of \($mean\) feet; however, one marine biologist believes
that great white sharks off the Bermuda coast grow much longer. To test this claim,
full-grown white sharks were captured, measured, and then set free. However, this was a
difficult, costly and very dangerous task, so only four sharks were actually sampled. Their
lengths were \($l[0], \ $l[1], \ $l[2], \mbox{and} \ $l[3] \) feet. Do the data provide
sufficient evidence to support the claim? Use \(\alpha = $alpha\).
$BR $BR
${BBOLD}Recall:$EBOLD You can enter this data into ${BBOLD}R$EBOLD using the command: ${BBOLD}sharklength = c($l[0], $l[1], $l[2], $l[3])$EBOLD (you can call the dataset whatever you like, "sharklength" is just an example). Next, compute the test statistic using the ${BBOLD}t.test$EBOLD command. For more details on entering data by hand, check out the PPT 01 R script, for more on ${BBOLD}t.test$EBOLD see the PPT 08 8 R script. 
$BR
$PAR
(a) Calculate the test statistic: \(t = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(b) Find the \(p\)-value:   \{ans_rule(10)\}

(c) \{ $mc->print_q() \}
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
