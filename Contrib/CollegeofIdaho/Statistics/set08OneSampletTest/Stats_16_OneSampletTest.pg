#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
When a poultry farmer uses his regular feed, the newborn chickens have normally distributed weights with a mean of 
\($m\) oz.
In an experiment with an enriched feed mixture, ten chickens are born with the following weights (in ounces). 

\[ $sw[0], \ $sw[1], \ $sw[2], \ $sw[3], \ $sw[4], \ $sw[5], \ $sw[6], \ $sw[7], \ $sw[8], \ $sw[9] \]

Use an \( \alpha=$alpha \) significance level to test the claim that the mean weight is higher with the enriched feed.
$BR $BR
$BBOLD Recall:$EBOLD You can enter this data straight into ${BBOLD}R$EBOLD using the command: ${BBOLD}chickendata = c($sw[0], $sw[1], ..., $sw[9])$EBOLD (you can call the dataset whatever you like, "chickendata" is just an example). Then compute sample mean (etc) as usual: ${BBOLD}mean(chickendata)$EBOLD.
$BR
$PAR
(a) The sample mean is \(\overline{x} = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
(b) The sample standard deviation is \( s = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
(c) The test statistic is \(t = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} 
$PAR
(d) The \(p\)-value is \(p = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
(e) \{$ mc->print_q() \}
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
