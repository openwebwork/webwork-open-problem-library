#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
\($n\) people are randomly selected and the accuracy of their wristwatches is checked, 
with positive errors representing watches that are ahead of the correct time and negative 
errors representing watches that are behind the correct time. The \($n\) values have a 
mean of \($x\) seconds and a standard deviation of \($s\) seconds. Use a \($alpha\) significance
level to test the claim that the population of all watches has a mean of \(0\) seconds. 
$PAR
(a)  The test statistic is \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
$PAR
(b)   The \(p\)-value is \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
$PAR
(c)  \{ $mc ->print_q() \} 
$BR
 \{ $mc ->print_a() \}
