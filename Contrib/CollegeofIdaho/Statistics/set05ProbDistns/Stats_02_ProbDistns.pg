#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A breakdown of \($n\) civil cases that were originally tried in front of a judge (not a jury) and appealed by either the plaintiff or defendant is reproduced in the following table. 
$BR $BR
\{
DataTable(
  [
    [["Outcome of Appeal", headerrow => 1],"Number of Cases"],
    ["Plaintiff trial win - reversed","\($p\)"],
    ["Plaintiff trial win - affirmed/dismissed","\($q\)"],
    ["Defendant trail win - reversed","\($r\)"],
    ["Defendant trial win - affirmed/dismissed","\($s\)"]
  ], 
  align => '| l | c |',
   midrules => 1,
);
\}
$BR
Suppose each civil case is awarded points (positive or negative) on the basis of the outcome of the appeal for the purpose of evaluating the judge. If the appeal is affirmed or dismissed, \(+5\) points are awarded. If the appeal of a plaintiff trial win is reversed, \(-1\) point is awarded. If the appeal of a defendant trial win is reversed, \(-3\) points are awarded. Suppose that one of the \($n\) cases is selected at random, and the number \(X\) of points awarded is determined. Fill out the probability distribution represented in the table below (put the \(X\) values in $BBOLD increasing order, from smallest to largest$EBOLD and make sure to keep at least four decimal places of accuracy in your probability values). 
$BR $BR
\{
DataTable(
  [
    ['\(X\)',ans_rule(6),ans_rule(6),ans_rule(6)],
    ['\(P(X)\)',ans_rule(6),ans_rule(6),ans_rule(6)]
  ], 
  align => '| c | c | c | c |',
   midrules => 1,
