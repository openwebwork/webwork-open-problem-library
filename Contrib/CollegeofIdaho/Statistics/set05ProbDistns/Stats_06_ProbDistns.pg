#  Main

BEGIN_TEXT
The physical fitness of a patient is often measured by the patient's maximum oxygen uptake (recorded in milliliters per kilogram, ml/kg).  The mean maximum oxygen uptake for cardiac patients who regularly participate in sports or exercise programs was found to be \($mu,\) with a standard deviation of \($sdev.\) Assume that this distribution is approximately normal.
$BR
Find the following. ${BITALIC}(Note: Give answers as decimal proportions, not percentages.)$EITALIC
$PAR
(a) What is the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly participates in sports has a maximum oxygen uptake of at least \($x1\) ml/kg?
$BR
Answer: \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$PAR
(b) What is the probability that a cardiac patient who regularly exercises has a maximum oxygen uptake of \($x2\) ml/kg or lower? 
$BR
Answer: \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
(c)   \{ $mc[1] -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{$mc[1] -> print_a() \} 
$BR

Let \(x\) be the oxygen uptake of a cardiac patient.
$BR $BR
(a)  \( P(x > $x1) = $ans_a\)
