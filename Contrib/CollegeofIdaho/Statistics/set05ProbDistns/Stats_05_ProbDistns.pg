BEGIN_TEXT
Casino gaming yields over ${DOLLAR}\(35\) billion in revenue each year in the United States.  Casino games of pure chance (e.g., craps, roulette, baccarat, and keno) always yield a "house advantage." For example, in the game of double-zero roulette, the expected casino win percentage is \($mu\)$PERCENT on bets made on whether the outcome will be either black or red. It can be shown that in \(100\) roulette plays on black/red, the average casino win percentage is normally distributed with mean of \($mu\)$PERCENT and standard deviation of \($sdev\)$PERCENT.  Let \(x\) represent the average casino win percentage after 100 bets on black/red in double-zero roulette.
$BR
 ${BITALIC}Note: Keep this value as a percentage, so use \(mean = $mu,\) do not convert to a proportion, \($prop.\)$EITALIC
$BR
Determine the following:
$PAR
(a) \( P( x > 0) =\) \{ ans_rule(10) \} $PERCENT (This is the probability that the casino wins money.)
$PAR
(b) \( P( $x1 < x < $x2) =\) \{ ans_rule(10) \} $PERCENT 
$PAR
(c) \( P(x < $x3)  =\) \{ ans_rule(10) \} $PERCENT
$PAR
(d) $BBOLD What do the probabilities in parts (b) and (c) represent?$EBOLD Be prepared to answer such a question on a lab, quiz, or exam.

# Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
(a)  \( P( x > 0)  = $ans_a\)  $PERCENT
$PAR
(b)  \( P( $x1 < x < $x2) = $ans_b\)  $PERCENT
$PAR
(c) \( P(x < $x3)  =  $ans_c\)   $PERCENT
$PAR
(d) Each represents the probability of average casino win percentage after 100 bets on black/red in double-zero roulette being \(x\)${PERCENT}. For example, for part (b), the probability of the casino's win percentage being between \($x1\)$PERCENT and \($x2\)$PERCENT is \($ans_b\)${PERCENT}.
