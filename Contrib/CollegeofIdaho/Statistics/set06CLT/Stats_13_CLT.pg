#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Shelia's doctor is concerned that she may suffer from gestational diabetes
(high blood glucose levels during pregnancy).  There is variation both in the actual
glucose level and in the blood test that measures the level. A patient is classified
as having gestational diabetes if the glucose level is above \(140\) milligrams per
deciliter one hour after a sugary drink is ingested.  Shelia's measured glucose 
level one hour after ingesting the sugary drink varies according to the Normal 
distribution with mean \($mu\) mg/dl and standard deviation \($sigma\) mg/dl.  Let \(L\)
denote a patient's glucose level. 
$PAR
(a)  If measurements are made on $n[$choose] different days, determine \( L\)
such that there is a probability of only \($p\) that the mean glucose level of $n[$choose] test results falls above \( L \) for Shelia's glucose level distribution.  What is the value of \( L \)? In other words, determine the value of \(L\) so that \(P(\bar{x}>L) = $p\).
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
Answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$PAR
(b)  If measurements are made on $n[$choose] different days, and the mean result from the $n[$choose] tests is compared to the criterion \(140\) mg/dl, what is the probability that Shelia is diagnosed as having gestational diabetes?

#  Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
Since the distribution is normal,  the standard deviation for a sample of size $n[$choose] is: \(\bar{\sigma} = \dfrac{$sigma}{\sqrt{$sampleSize[$choose]}} = $sigmaSD\)
$BR $BR
(a)  We need to determine the value of \(L\) so that \(P(\bar{x}>L) = $p\). The \(z\)-score for the probability \($p\) is \(z = $zscore.\)  Calculate \(L\) by
\{
LayoutTable(
  [
     ['z', '=', '\dfrac{L - \mu}{\bar{\sigma}}'],
     ['z \bar{\sigma}' ,'=', 'L - \mu'],
     ['\mu + z \bar{\sigma}', '=', 'L.']
  ], 
  align => 'rcl',
  encase => ['\(','\)'],
  allcellcss => ' padding:4px; '
);
\}
Hence,
\[L = $mu + $zscore($sigmaSD) = $xscore\]
$BR $BR
(b)  The \(z\)-score is calculated by: \(z = \dfrac{$x2 - \mu}{\bar{\sigma}} = \dfrac{$x2 - $mu}{$sigmaSD} = $zscore2 \)
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
In this case, \(P(\bar{x}>$x2) = P(z > $zscore2) = $pval2\).
