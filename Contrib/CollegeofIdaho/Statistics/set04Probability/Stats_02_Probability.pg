${BBOLD}Gang research study.$EBOLD The National Gang Crime Research Center (NGCRC) has developed a six-level gang classification system for both adults and juveniles. Suppose a study was conducted where data was collected on approximately $n confined offenders and assigned each a score, using the gang classification system.  One of the other variables measured in the study was whether or not the offender ever carried a homemade weapon (e.g., a knife) while in custody. The table below gives the numbers of confined offenders in each of the gang score and homemade weapon categories.  
\{
DataTable(
  [
  [['Gang Classification Score',headerrow => 1] ,  'Weapon' , 'No weapon' , 'Total'],
  ['0 (Never joined a gang, no close friends in a gang)',"\($yes[0]\)","\($no[0]\)","\($tot[0]\)"],
  ['1 (Never joined a gang, 1-4 close friends in a gang)',"\($yes[0]\)","\($no[0]\)","\($tot[0]\)"],
  ['2 (Never joined a gang, 5 or more friends in a gang)',"\($yes[0]\)","\($no[0]\)","\($tot[0]\)"],
  ['3 (Inactive gang member)',"\($yes[0]\)","\($no[0]\)","\($tot[0]\)"],
  ['4 (Active gang member, no position of rank)',"\($yes[0]\)","\($no[0]\)","\($tot[0]\)"],
  ['5 (Active gang member, holds position of rank)',"\($yes[0]\)","\($no[0]\)","\($tot[0]\)"],
