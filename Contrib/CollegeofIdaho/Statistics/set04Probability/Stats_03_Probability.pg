${BBOLD}Cigar smoking and cancer.$EBOLD A following study investigates the association between cigar smoking and death from tobacco-related cancers.  (See Note below.) The data represents \($tot\) American men.  The results are summarized in the accompanying table.  Each male in the study was classified according to his cigar-smoking status and whether or not he died from tobacco-related cancer.
