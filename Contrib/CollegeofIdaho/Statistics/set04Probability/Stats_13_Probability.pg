${BBOLD}Antibiotic for blood infections.$EBOLD Enterococci are bacteria that cause blood infections in hospitalized patients. One antibiotic used to battle enterococci is vancomycin.  A study by a large nationwide health system revealed that \($e\)$PERCENT of all enterococci in its hospitals were resistant to vancomycin. Consider a random sample of $num[$n-3] patients with blood infections caused by the enterococci bacterium.  Suppose that all $num[$n-3] patients are treated with the antibiotic vancomycin.

a) What is the probability that all $num[$n-3] patients are treated successfully?  
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
Answer: \{ans_rule(15)\}

b) What is the probability that the bacteria resist the antibiotic in at least one patient?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The probability that the treatment is successful is \(1 - $p=$p_success\).
$BR
(a) Since there are $num[$n-3] patients, the probability that all patients are successfully treated is: \($p_success^$n = $ans_a\)
$BR
(b) The probability that at least one patient has antibiotic resistant bacteria is the complement of the event that all the patients are treated successfully. $BR
So, \(1 - $ans_a = $ans_b\)
