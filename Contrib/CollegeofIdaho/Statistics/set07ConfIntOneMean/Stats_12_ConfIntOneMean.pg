#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Data from a psychology experiment were reported and analyzed in $BITALIC The American Statistician$EITALIC (May 2001). Two samples of female students participated in the experiment. One sample consisted of \(11\) students known to suffer from the eating disorder bulimia; the other sample consisted of \(14\) students with normal eating habits. Each student completed a questionnaire from which a "fear of negative evaluation" (FNE) score was produced. (The higher the score, the greater the fear of negative evaluation.) The data are saved in the file $BBOLD BULIMIA.csv$EBOLD. 
$PAR
(a) Use ${BBOLD}R$EBOLD to estimate, with \($conf[$choose]\)$PERCENT confidence, the true mean FNE score for all bulimic female students.
