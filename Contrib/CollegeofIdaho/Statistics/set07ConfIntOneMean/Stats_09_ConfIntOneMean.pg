#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A study of the career paths of hotel general managers sent questionnaires to a random sample 
of \($n1\) hotels belonging to major U.S. hotel chains.  There were \($n2\) responses.  The
average time these \($n2\) general managers had spent with their current company was 
\($xbar\) years, and the standard deviation of time with the company was \($sd\) years.)
$PAR
(a)  Find the margin of error for a confidence interval to estimate
the mean time a general manager had spent with their current company. Use a confidence level of \($conf\)$PERCENT.
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
Answer:  \{ans_rule(15)\}  years 
$PAR
(b)   Find the margin of error for a confidence interval to estimate
the mean time a general manager had spent with their current company. Use a confidence level of \(99\)$PERCENT. 
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
Answer:  \{ans_rule(15)\}  years 
$PAR
(c)    In general, increasing the confidence level \{ans_rule(15)\} the margin of error (width) of the confidence interval.

#  Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
(a)   Margin of error for a \($conf\)$PERCENT confidence interval: \($t1 \left(\frac{$sd}{ \sqrt{$n2}}\right) = $ans_a\)
$BR
(b)   Margin of error for a \(99\)$PERCENT confidence interval: \($t2 \left(\frac{$sd}{ \sqrt{$n2}}\right) = $ans_b\)
$BR
(c)   In general, increasing the confidence level ${BBOLD}$ans_c$EBOLD the margin of error (width) of the confidence interval.
