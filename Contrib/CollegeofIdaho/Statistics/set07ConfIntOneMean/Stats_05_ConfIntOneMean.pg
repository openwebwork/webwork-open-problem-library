#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Justin is interested in buying a new cell phone.  He visited \($n\) stores at random and recorded the
price of the particular phone he wants. The sample of prices had a mean of $DOLLAR\($mean\) and a
standard deviation of $DOLLAR\($s.\) 
$PAR

(a) What \(t\)-value should be used for a \(95\)$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean price, \(\mu\), of this model of cell phone? 
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
\(t^\ast =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b) Calculate a \(95\)$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean price of this model of cell phone. (Make sure to use at least four decimal places of accuracy in your \(t^\ast\) reported above.)
$BR
${BITALIC}(Note: Enter the smaller value in the left answer box. Your answer must be in terms of dollars: ${DOLLAR}xxx.xx)$EITALIC
$BR $SPACE $SPACE
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} to \{ ans_rule(10) \}

$ans_a = Compute($t);
ANS($ans_a->cmp);
Context("Currency");
$ans_b1 = Currency("$lower");
ANS($ans_b1->cmp);
Context("Currency");
$ans_b2 = Currency("$upper");
ANS($ans_b2->cmp);

#Example 1 from PPT08 is a good model to follow for this problem.  
#I see that you already have the t*.  In the PPT08 script, this is line 52.  
#The next few lines demonstrate the calculation of the interval.  Does this help?

# Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
(a)  \(t^\ast = $t\) (\(df = $df\))
$BR
(b) \($ans_b1\) to \($ans_b1\)
