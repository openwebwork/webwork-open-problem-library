#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
In planning for a new forest road to be used for tree harvesting, planners must select the location that will minimize tractor skidding distance. In the ${BITALIC}Journal of Forest Engineering$EITALIC (July 1999), reserchers wanted to estimate the true mean skidding distance along a new road in a European forest. The skidding distances (in meters) were measured at \(20\) randomly selected road sites. These data are stored in the file $BBOLD SKIDDING.csv$EBOLD as the variable $BBOLD DISTANCE$EBOLD. 
$PAR
(a) Use ${BBOLD}R$EBOLD to estimate, with \($conf\)$PERCENT confidence, the true mean skidding distance of the road.

$PAR
(b)  \{ $mcb -> print_q() \}

$PAR
(c) A logger working on the road claims that the mean skidding distance is at least \($skid\) meters. Do the data support the logger's claim?
