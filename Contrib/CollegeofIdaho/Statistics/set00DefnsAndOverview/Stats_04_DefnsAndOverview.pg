#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Are men or women more adept at remembering where they leave misplaced items (such as car keys)? According to University of Florida psychology professor Robin West, women show greater competence in actually finding these objects (${BITALIC}Explore$EITALIC, Fall 1998). Approximately \(300\) men and women from Gainesville, Florida participated in a study in which each person placed \(20\) common objects in a \(12\)-room "virtual" house represented on a computer screen. Thirty minutes later, the subjects were asked to recall where they put each of the objects. For each object, a recall variable was measured as ${BITALIC}"yes"${EITALIC} or ${BITALIC}"no"${EITALIC}.
