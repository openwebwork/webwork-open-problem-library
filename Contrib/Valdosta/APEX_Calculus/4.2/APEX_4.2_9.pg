A $ladder ft. ladder is leaning against a house while
the base is pulled away at a constant rate of $spd ft./s.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR
Construct a right triangle with base \(x\) measuring
the distance from the house to the base of the ladder,
height \(y\) measuring from the ground to the top
of the ladder, and hypotenuse formed by the ladder
itself.  By the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[
  x^2 + y^2 = $ladder^2
\]
$PAR
The goal is to find \( \dfrac{dy}{dt} \).
Take time-derivatives of both sides of the
equation.  
\[
  2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} + 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 0
\]
$PAR
Then plug in \( \dfrac{dx}{dt} = $spd\) and solve for
the unknown rate.
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    $s2 x + 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} &=& 0 \\
    &&\\
    \dfrac{dy}{dt} &=& -\dfrac{$s2 x}{2y}
  \end{array}
\]
$PAR
When \(x = 1\),
\[
  1^2 + y^2 = $ladder^2 \;\Rightarrow\; y = \sqrt{$a1}
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \; \dfrac{dy}{dt}
  = -\dfrac{$s2(1)}{2\sqrt{$a1}} \approx -$x1.
\]
$PAR
When \(x = 5\),
\[
  5^2 + y^2 = $ladder^2 \;\Rightarrow\; y = \sqrt{$a2}
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \; \dfrac{dy}{dt}
  = -\dfrac{$s2(5)}{2\sqrt{$a2}} \approx -$x2.
\]
$PAR
When \(x = $m\),
\[
  $m^2 + y^2 = $ladder^2 \;\Rightarrow\; y = \sqrt{$a3}
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \; \dfrac{dy}{dt}
  = -\dfrac{$s2($m)}{2\sqrt{$a3}} \approx -$x3.
\]
$PAR
Each rate found above is negative, which indicates the top
of the ladder is falling.  Take the absolute value of
each to answer the questions.
