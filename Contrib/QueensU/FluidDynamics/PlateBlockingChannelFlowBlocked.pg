BEGIN_PGML

Water flowing in a small channel is partially impeded by a plate held in place by force [`F`]. The water approaches the plate with a velocity of [`V_{1}`] and a depth of [`h_{1}`]. The angle of the gate, relative to the vertical,  is [`\theta`]. The channel has a constant width of [`w = 0.5`] [`m`]. The plate has a length of [`l = 1.8`] [`m`].  Assume that the height at the exit of the gate, [`h_{2}`], is approximately equal to the distance between the bottom of the gate and the bottom of the river, [`d`].  

[@ image('PlateBlockingChannelFlowBlocked.png', width=>1343, height=>218) @]*

Suppose now that the plate is replaced with one that fully blocks the channel (depicted on the right) such that [`V_{1}=`] [`V_{2}= 0`] [`m/s`]. How does this change the force, F, that must be applied?
