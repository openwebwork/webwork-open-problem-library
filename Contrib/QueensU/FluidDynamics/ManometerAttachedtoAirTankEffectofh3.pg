BEGIN_PGML

A Water manometer is attached to a small pressurized air tank with the geometry depicted below. The heights of the depicted points of the system are: [`h_{1}`] [`m`], [`h_{2}`] [`m`], and [`h_{3}`] [`m`]. 

[@ image('ManometerAttachedtoAirTankEffectofh3.png', width=>332, height=>373) @]*

If the height [`h_{3}`] is doubled, how is the manometer height, [`h_{1}-`][`h_{2}`], affected?

 

Discussion: Are there any other geometry changes that would affect the manometer height?  
[@ $mc->buttons() @]*
