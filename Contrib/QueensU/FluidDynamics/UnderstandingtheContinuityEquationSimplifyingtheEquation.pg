$mc = RadioButtons(
	["All flow through the control volume is laminar", "The volume of the control volume remains constant", "The system is at steady-state", "The mass flow rate into the control volume is constant"],
	"The system is at steady-state"
);

BEGIN_PGML

The equation below is one of the standard forms of the continuity equation:

[`\partial/\partial t \int_{CV} \rho dV\llap{-} + \int_{CS} \rho \vec{V}\cdot \hat{n} dA = 0`]

where [`V`] is volume, and [`U`] is velocity.

Under what circumstances can the first term of the continuity equation be eliminated (made equal to zero) when applied to a control volume?
