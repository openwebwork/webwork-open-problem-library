$mc = RadioButtons(
	["No change in position.", "Slightly closer to the surface.", "slightly closer to the bottom.", "At the surface of the water.", "On the ocean floor.", "At the surface such that a small volume of the sub (equal to the volume of the barnacle that fell off) is above the surface of the water."],

);

BEGIN_PGML

A submarine is floating (zero velocity) in equilibrium and is fully submerged in the ocean.  A barnacle which had been attached to the submarine breaks off and sinks.  Assuming constant water density and a hydrostatic distribution, what will be the final equilibrium position of the sub?  
[@ $mc->buttons() @]*
