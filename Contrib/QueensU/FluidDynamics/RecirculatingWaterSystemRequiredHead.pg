BEGIN_PGML

A recirculating water system is depicted below. The system uses [`8"`] SCH 40, wrought iron piping. A water pump provides head to the water which flows through a fully opened open ball valve. Water then flows through two devices with minor loss coefficients of [`K_{1} = [$K1]`] and [`K_{2} = [$K2]`], respectively. Water is then recovered in a large tank, and drained through a sharp-edged entry back to the supply pump.  All elbows in the system are regular and flanged. The locations depicted in the diagram have heights of [`h_{1} = 10`] [`m`], [`h_{2} = 2`] [`m`], and [`h_{3} = 15`] [`m`]. The total length of pipe in the system is [`L  = [$L]`] [`m`].

[@ image('RecirculatingWaterSystemRequiredHead.png', width=>496, height=>410) @]*

For a required flow rate of [`[$Q]`] [`m^{3}/s`], determine the required head from the pump.

[`h=`][____] [`m`]

_Hint:Friction factor should be around 0.015_
