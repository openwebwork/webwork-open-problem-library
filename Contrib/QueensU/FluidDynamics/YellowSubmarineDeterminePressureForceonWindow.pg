BEGIN_PGML

Two friends, John and Paul, are designing a yellow submarine for all their friends to live in. During regular operation the center of each window of the submarine will sit [`h = [$h]`] [`m`] below the surface of the water. At the middle of the submarine there will be square viewing window of dimensions [`l \times w = [$l] \times [$w]`] [`m`], as depicted in the diagram below.

[@ image('YellowSubmarineDeterminePressureForceonWindow.png', width=>1026, height=>529) @]*

Determine the total pressure force that the square window must be able to sustain.

Discussion: If the pressure force was simplified to a point force, where is this force applied on the rectangular window?

[`F=`][____] [`kN`]
