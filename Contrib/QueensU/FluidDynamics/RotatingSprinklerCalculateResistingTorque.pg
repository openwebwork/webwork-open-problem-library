BEGIN_PGML

A rotating sprinkler is used to water the grass on a lawn. Water flows into the sprinkler with a velocity of [`V_{1} = [$V1]`] [`m/s`] through a circular inlet of diameter [`D = [$D]`] [`cm`]. Water then flows out through four arms of length [`R = [$R]`] [`m`] and is sprayed at a [`90^{\circ}`] angle through circular holes of diameter [`d = 0.5`] [`cm`]. The sprinkler operates at steady-state, and friction in the system was assumed to be negligible.

Suppose that there is unexpected friction in the system such that at steady-state the sprinkler only rotates with an angular velocity of [`\omega = 25`] [`rad/s`]. What is the resisting torque due to friction, [`T`], that must be present in the system?

[`T=`][____] [`Nm`]
