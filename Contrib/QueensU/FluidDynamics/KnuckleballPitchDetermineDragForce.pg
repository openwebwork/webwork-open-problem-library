BEGIN_PGML

In baseball a knuckleball is a unique type of pitch where the ball is thrown without inducing any spin (negligible angular velocity). These pitches can cause unpredictable wavering of the ball as it flies through the air due to asymmetric drag forces appearing at its seams. The motions cause the knuckleball to be exceptionally difficult to hit.

A knuckleball baseball pitch is thrown through the air (standard conditions) with a velocity of [`V = [$V]`] [`m/s`]. Wind speed is negligible. Approximate the baseball as perfect sphere with a rough surface. A standard baseball has a diameter of approximately [`74`] [`mm`].

Using the table above, determine the frontal drag force that is experienced by the baseball at the instant it is released from the pitcher's fingers. Express your answer in Newtons.
