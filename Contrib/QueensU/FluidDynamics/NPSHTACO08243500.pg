BEGIN_PGML

Your facility already includes multiple TACO TA 0824 pumps, so using the same pump for a new application has many advantages in terms of spares and maintenance costs. The new application has a design flow of [`0.05`] [`m^3/s`] and a head of [`65`] [`m`] pumping water at [`20^{\circ}C`]. The application includes [`42`] [`m`] of useful elevation gain with the rest being losses, so the system curve can be expressed as [`H = 42 + 23\cdot (\frac{Q}{50})^2`] for [`H`] in metres and [`Q`] in litres/s

The TA 0824 running at [`3500`] [`RPM`] appears to be in the right range. (Look towards the end of the curve book.)

We ordered one with a [`9.00`] [`inch`] impeller, possibly over design capacity. Considering the NPSH, and assuming we are pumping from a lake, what answer is closest to the maximum elevation above the water level at which you could safely install the pump?

Discussion: Detail the logic behind your choice, considering operation at both the design flow rate and with all control valves wide open. Provide a copy of the manufacturer's pump curve, showing the operating points you considered to reach your conclusion.

Show an example of how you would calculate the NPSH available if you had more design details.
