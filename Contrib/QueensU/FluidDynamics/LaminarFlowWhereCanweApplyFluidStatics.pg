BEGIN_PGML

Water flows along a surface as indicated in the diagram below. The flow is entirely laminar.

[@ image('LaminarFlowWhereCanweApplyFluidStatics.png', width=>692, height=>216) @]*

At which cross-sections of the flow is pressure linearly dependent on y only, following the relations we have for fluid statics?  
[@ $mc->buttons() @]*

END_PGML

ANS($mc->cmp());
