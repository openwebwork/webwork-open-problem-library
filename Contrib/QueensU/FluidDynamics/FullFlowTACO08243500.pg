BEGIN_PGML

Your facility already includes multiple TACO TA 0824 pumps, so using the same pump for a new application has many advantages in terms of spares and maintenance costs. The new application has a design flow of [`0.05`] [`m^3/s`] and a head of [`65`] [`m`] pumping water at [`20^{\circ}C`]. The application includes [`42`] [`m`] of useful elevation gain with the rest being losses, so the system curve can be expressed as [`H = 42 + 23\cdot \frac{Q}{50}^2 for H`] in metres and [`Q`] in litres/s

The TA 0824 running at [`3500`] [`RPM`] appears to be in the right range. (Look towards the end of the curve book.)

We ordered one with a [`9.00`] [`inch`] impeller, possibly over design capacity. What flow rate would you get from the [`9.00`] [`inch`] impeller installation with all valves fully open? (pick the closest)

Discussion: Provide a copy of the manufacturer's pump curve, showing the operating points you considered to reach your conclusion.
