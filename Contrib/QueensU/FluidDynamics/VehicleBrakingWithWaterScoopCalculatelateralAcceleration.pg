$V0 = random(80,120,5);

BEGIN_PGML

A vehicle of mass [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`] is moving horizontally with a velocity of [`V_{0}`] [`_{}= [$V0]`] [`m/s`] uses a scoop as a braking system by lowering it into a river. The river flows with a velocity of [`V_{r} = -[$Vr]`] [`m/s`] (opposite direction of the vehicle's velocity). The scoop has a width of [`w = 0.2`] [`m`], and it redirects flow from the river by [`180^{\circ}`].

[@ image('VehicleBrakingWithWaterScoopCalculatelateralAcceleration.png', width=>652, height=>331) @]*

If the scoop is dipped h = [$h] m below the surface of the river, what is the vehicle's initial *acceleration*, in [`m/s^{2}`]?

Discussion: How does this compare to the Pelton Wheel example? What would happen if we changed the scoop angle to about 200 degrees, directing the flow back down towards the river?
