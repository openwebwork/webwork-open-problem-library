BEGIN_PGML

Water flows into a cylindrical pipe, initially with an x-directional velocity vector, [`U_{0}`], that is independent of y and z. As the water travels through the pipe a laminar flow pattern develops.

[@ image('FlowDevelopmentinaPipePointBYVelocity.png', width=>845, height=>236) @]*

Consider the formula for Incompressible Continuity:

[`\partial u/\partial x + \partial v/\partial y + \partial w/\partial z = 0`]

Far down the pipe at point B, which is on the center line of the pipe, the flow is fully developed. The value of the second term term of this equation is...
