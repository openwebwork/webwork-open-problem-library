##  Create the match list. Your questions with the correct answers go in 
##  $match->qa as a pair. $match->choose is the number of questions that will be
##  chosen from the list of question/answer pairs (ideally this would be less
##  than or equal to the number of questions in the list). $match->extra 
##  is a list of extra answers just to throw the student off, 
##  $match->choose_extra is how many of the extra answers will be chosen. 
##
##   You can TeX your questions and answers as you would normally by putting 
##   them in \(\) pairs in the quotes.
