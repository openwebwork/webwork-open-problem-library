Match the functions with the graphs labeled A - D.  As always, you may
click on the thumbnail image to produce a larger image in a new window
(sometimes exactly on top of the old one).  Just take your time;
process of elimination will help with ones that are not obvious.

COMMENT('This demonstrates one way to insert a table of graphs into a problem. The graphs will be shuffled for each student. The drawback to writing a problem with external graphs is that you will need help from your WeBWorK admin to put the graphs on the server.');
