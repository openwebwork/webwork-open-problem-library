$BBOLD Related Rates Problem Solving Technique:$EBOLD
$BR
1) Draw a picture. Anything that is changing in the problem gets labeled with a variable.
$BR
2) Identify what is given. For a related rates problem the only given we are worried about initially is the rate. Write this rate in Leibniz notation.
$BR
3) Write down the quantity you are being asked for in Leibniz notation.
$BR
4) Relate the given rate to the rate being sought using the chain rule.
$BR
5) Solve!
$BR
$BBOLD Example $EBOLD
$BR
The sides of a square are increasing at a rate of \(2 \frac{in}{s}\). Find the rate at which the area is increasing when the length of the side of the square is 5 inches.
$BR
1)Since the sides of the square are changing they get labeled with a variable.
$BR
\{image("square.gif");\}
$BR
2) We are given that the sides are increasing by 2 inches every second, in Leibniz notation: \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \frac{in}{s}\).
$BR
3) We are asked to find the rate of change of the area: \(\frac{dA}{dt}\).
$BR
4) By the chain rule: \(\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{dA}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dA}{dt}2\). 
$BR
5) We need to compute \(\frac{dA}{dx}\). To compute this we need A as a function of x: \(A = x^2\). So \(\frac{dA}{dx} = 2x \frac{in^2}{in}\). Now that we have computed the derivative we can plug in x = 5 in: \(\frac{dA}{dx} = 2*5 in = 10 in.\)
$BR
\(\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{dA}{dx}*2=10 in.*2\frac{in}{s} = 20\frac{in}{s}\).
