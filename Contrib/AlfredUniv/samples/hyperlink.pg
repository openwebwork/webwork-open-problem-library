BEGIN_TEXT
The average rate of change of a function f(x)from x = a to x = b
$BR
= The slope of the secant line joining the points (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)) on the graph of f
$BR
=\(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\)
$BR
= \(\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}\)
$BR
where \(\Delta x = b-a\).
$BR
The following applets demonstrate the slope of a secant line and how the secant lines converge to the tangent line as \(\Delta x\) goes to zero. The function x is not that interesting, so you should change it to one of the other functions available.
