TEXT(beginproblem());

## This is a simple problem, but without defining limits on the formula $f
## we run the risk that webwork will try to test the formula at a point where f ## is undefined, making the problem report an error to the student

 
## Function definition
$f = Formula("(x^2+1)/x")->reduce;
## Since $f is not defined at zero we need to tell webwork that.
$f->{limits} = [.001,12];
## I have not figured out how to make a union of intervals yet.

## Note that you can also set the limits of the variables in the context
## 
## Context()->flags->set(limits => [-2,2],# limits for variables in formulas
## num_points => 5,# the number of test points );
##
## or the actual points to be tested
## $f->{test_points} = [[11],[11.5],[12]];

## Note that if you have added a variable to the context, like k, webwork will 
## still believe that the default variable x is also a variable. If you define 
## a funtion of k that function actually has two variables in it, x and k, you
## need to know this when you are defining the test points.

COMMENT('Webwork tests to see if two formulas are equal by plugging values into each. This problem demonstrates several methods for limiting the domain of a formula so that WeBWorK will not attempt to test points not in the domain.');
