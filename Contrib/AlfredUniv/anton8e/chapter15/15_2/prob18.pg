## DESCRIPTION
## This problem contains a bonus section the student can access when they get 
## the original problem correct. The bonus is a historical derivation of the 
## same volume using techniques discovered by Zu Ghonghzi and Archimedes.

## You will need to modify the login information below if you want to be able to
## reset the problem.

$BBOLD BONUS: $EBOLD
$BR
This figure is known alternately as the double square umbrella, the bicylinder, and the Steinmetz solid. Archimedes(287 BC – c. 212 BC) and Liu Hui (ca. 220- ca. 280) calculated the volume of this solid separately 1500-2000 years before the invention of the calculus, using calculus ideas.
$BR 
Both cylinders circumscribe a sphere of radius $r at their intersection, hence that sphere is inscribed in the double square umbrella. If you take a vertical slice of the double square umbrella with the inscribed sphere using the x-z plane, notice that the sphere and cylinder \(y^2+z^2=$r^2\) are both circles of radius $r. Similarly a slice using the y-z plane yields a circle of intersection with radius $r of the sphere and the cylinder \(x^2+z^2=$r^2\).
$BR
Another way of saying this is that if you take a horizontal slice at height h of the double square umbrella with the inscribed sphere you get circle inscribed in a square. 
$BR
The radius of the inscribed circle is \{ans_rule(20)\}, which is also the length of one half of the side of the circumscribing square. Therefore the ratio of the area of the square to the inscribed circle is \{ans_rule(20)\}. Since this is constant for every such section, the volume of the double square umbrella is \{ans_rule(20)\} times that of the inscribed sphere (known as Cavalieri's Principle). Liu Hui had to wait a few centuries for Zu  Chongzhi (429 - 500) and his son Zu Geng (450 - 520) to compute the volume of the sphere, while Archimedes was able to compute it himself\(^1\). The volume of a sphere of radius r is \{ans_rule(20)\} making the volume of the double square umbrella with "radius" r \{ans_rule(20)\}.
