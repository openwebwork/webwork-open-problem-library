BEGIN_TEXT
In this problem you will derive the formula for the Laplace transform of the second derivative of a function \(y\). Use \(y\) and \(y^\prime\) for \(y(t)\) and \(y^\prime (t)\), \(y0\) and \(y1\) for the initial conditions \(y(0)\) and \(y^\prime(0)\), and \(Y\) for the Laplace transform of \(y\).
