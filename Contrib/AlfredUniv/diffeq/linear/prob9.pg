BEGIN_TEXT
Note that you must simplify your answers for this problem. \(\theta\) can be typed in as theta.
$BR
The linear differential equation \(\frac{dr}{d\theta}+r\sec(\theta) = \cos(\theta)\), for \( 0\leq\theta < \frac{\pi}{2}^*\), has integrating factor \{$integratingfactor->ans_rule\} 
$BR
After multiplying both sides by the integrating factor, simplifying, and unapplying the product rule we get the new differential equation:
$BR
\(\frac{d}{d\theta}\big[\) \{$newleft->ans_rule(20)\} \(\big]\) \(=\) \{$newright->ans_rule(20)\}
$BR 
Integrating both sides we get the algebraic equation
\{$integrateleft->ans_rule(30)\}=\{$integrateright->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
Solving for r, the solution to the differential equation is r = \{$solution->ans_rule(20)\} (use C for the constant)
$BR
$BR
\({}^*\) That interval is NOT chosen at random, it has important implications for the absolute values you are about to get.

BEGIN_HINT
$BR
The odds are you struggling with this problem because you did the integral of sec on your TI-89 and it gave you a not useful answer: \(\int\sec(\theta)d\theta=\ln(|\sec(\theta)+\tan(\theta)|)+C\) is simpler. If you pay close attention to the interval for \(\theta\) then the integrating factor simplifies greatly. You don't need the +C either.
