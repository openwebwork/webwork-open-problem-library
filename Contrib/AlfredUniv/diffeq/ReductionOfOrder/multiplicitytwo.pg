BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the DE
\[$diffeqn = x\]
which is linear with constant coefficients. \($y1\) is a solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation, we will see how to find this solution in the next section. We can use reduction of order to get a solution \(y_2 = u $y1\) of the original equation.
$BR
$BR
Then (using the prime notation for the derivatives)
$BR
\(y_2^\prime = \) \{$dyp->ans_rule(25)\}
$BR
\(y_2^{\prime\prime} = \)  \{$d2yp->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
So, plugging \(y_2\) into the left side of the differential equation, and reducing, we get
$BR
$BCENTER \(y_2^{\prime\prime}+$aandb y_2^\prime + $ab y_2 = \) \{$reducedequation->ans_rule(30)\} $ECENTER
$BR
$BR
So now our equation is \($y1 u^{\prime\prime} = x\).
To solve for u we need only integrate \(x e^{$b x}\) twice, using a as our first constant of integration and b as the second we get 
$BR
\(u = \) \{$u->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
Therefore \(y_2 =\) \{$general->ans_rule(30)\}, the general solution.
$BR
$BR
We knew from the beginning that \($y1\) was a solution. We have worked out is that \(x $y1\) is another solution to the homogeneous equation, which is generally the case when we have multiple roots. Then \($yp\) is the particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, and the general solution we derived is pieced together using superposition.
