$PAR
The PDE \[k^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}\]
is separable, so we look for solutions of the form \(u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\)
$BR
The PDE can be rewritten using this solution as (placing constants in the DE for T) into 
$BR
\{$Xdiff1->ans_rule\} = \{$Tdiff1->ans_rule\} = \(-\lambda\)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of \(X\) is written as \(X^\prime\). Do NOT use \(X^\prime(x)\)
$BR
$BR
Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated 
$BR
DE in X: \{$Xdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
DE in T: \{$Tdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
$BR
This leads us to a Sturm-Louiville problem. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants a and b and the general solution in Y is written with constants c and d.
$BR
$BBOLD Case 1: $EBOLD \(\lambda = 0\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xequal->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(T(t) = \) \{$Tequal->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(u = \) \{$uequal->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
$BBOLD Case 2: $EBOLD \(\lambda = -\alpha^2\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xless->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(T(t) = \) \{$Tless->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(u = \) \{$uless->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
$BBOLD Case 3: $EBOLD \(\lambda = \alpha^2 \)
