Let P(t) be the population of fish in a pond with carrying capacity \($K\).

Note: use K,K' instead of K(t), K'(t) in your answers. After you set up your differential equation you will have to set it equal to zero so that WeBWorK will understand your answer, do this in a way so that the highest order derivative has a positive coefficient.
