$BR
The amount of water a jogger evaporates E, in milliliters, is a function of c the calories expended. As the jogger runs the body loses water and begins to conserve. A simple model for the rate at which evaporation changes is \(E^\prime(c) = $E \frac{ml}{cal}\).
$BR
When \($c\) calories have been expended, at what rate is E changing? \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$BR
The formula for \(E^\prime\) can only be valid for \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\leq c \leq \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
When \($c\) calories have been expended, the rate at which water is evaporating is changing at the rate of  \{ans_rule(12)\}.
$BR
\(E^{\prime\prime} (c) = \) \{ans_rule(12)\}
