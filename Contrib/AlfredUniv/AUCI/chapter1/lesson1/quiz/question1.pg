BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that the function \(y = f(x)\) has an average rate of change of $rateofchange over the interval \([$a,$b]\). Then \(f($a) \) \{ $popup->menu() \} \(f($b)\).
$BR
$BR
This problem demonstrates that the sign of an average rate of change on an interval tells whether the function has experienced a net increase or net decrease on the interval.  Note that it does not describe the behavior of the function within the interval.
