Let \( S(t) \) be the amount of sales in dollars by a small business during the  \( t \)-th week after January 1. Suppose sales on January 1 were \($y0\) dollars and sales \($t1\) weeks later were \($y1\) dollars.  Compute the following over the time interval \( [$t0,$t1] \).  Enter the units by typing the full words or phrases (e.g., feet per second).

(c) \( \triangle S/\triangle t = \) \{ans_rule\}   Units? \{ans_rule(20)\}

(d) Use the average rate of change in part (c) to estimate the sales during the \($t2\)th week after January 1.  That is, estimate \(S($t2)\).
