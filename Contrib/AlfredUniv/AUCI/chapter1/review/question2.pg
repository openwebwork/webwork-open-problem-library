Let \( S(t) \) be the amount of sales in dollars by a small business during the  \( t \)-th week after January 1. Suppose sales on January 1 were \($y0\) dollars and sales \($t1\) weeks later were \($y1\) dollars.  Compute the following over the time interval \( [$t0,$t1] \).  Enter the units by typing the full words or phrases (e.g., feet per second).

(d) Use the average rate of change in Part (c) to estimate the sales during the \($t2\)th week after January 1.  That is, estimate \(S($t2)\).
