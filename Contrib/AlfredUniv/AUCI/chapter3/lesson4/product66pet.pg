The revenue ${BITALIC}R${EITALIC} for a new mobile device during day ${BITALIC}t${EITALIC} after its release is the product of the sales ${BITALIC}s${EITALIC} on that day and the set price ${BITALIC}p${EITALIC} for that day.  In this problem, the sales and  price both depend on day ${BITALIC}t${EITALIC}, hence so the does the revenue.  That is, \[ R(t) = s(t)p(t). \]    
$BR
On day \(t=$t\), the sales were \($s\) units  and ${BITALIC}decreasing${EITALIC} at a rate of \($sprime \) units per day.  On this same day, the price was \($p \) dollars per unit and ${BITALIC}increasing${EITALIC} at a rate of \($pprime \) dollars per unit per day.

By the product rule, the revenue was changing at the rate of
