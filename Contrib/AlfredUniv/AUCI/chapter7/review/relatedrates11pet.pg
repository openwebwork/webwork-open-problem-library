## Function Definition

$ladder = Compute(random(12,20));

$dydt = Compute(random(1.25,3.25,.5));
$y0 = Compute(random(3,7));
$x0 = Compute("sqrt(($ladder)^2-($y0)^2)");

if($x0 == $dydt){$dydt++};


##Solution

#algebra
$lhs = Formula("x^2+y^2");
$rhs = ($ladder)**2;


#implicitly differentiate
$dlhs = Formula("2*x*x'+2*y*y'");
$drhs = Compute("0");
#solve
$dxdt = Formula("-(y/x)*y'");
$dxdty0 = $dxdt->substitute(x=>"$x0",y=>"-$y0","y'"
=>"$dydt");

BEGIN_TEXT
A $ladder-ft ladder is leaning against a wall, and the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a constant rate of $dydt ft/s. How fast is the bottom of the ladder sliding away from the wall when the top of the ladder is $y0 ft above the ground?
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$BR
Let \(x\) be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and let \(y\) be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. Draw a labeled sketch! 
$BR$BR
The related variables equation is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER Related Variables Equation: $SPACE $SPACE \{ans_rule\} = $rhs $ECENTER
$BR
Implicitly differentiate both sides of the related variables equation with respect to \(t\), using \(x'\) for \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(y'\) for \(\frac{dy}{dt}\).  The related rates equation is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER Related Rates Equation: $SPACE $SPACE \{ans_rule\} = \{ans_rule(3)\} $ECENTER
$BR
Therefore, a formula for the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall is 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER \(x' = \frac{dx}{dt} = \) \{ans_rule\} $ECENTER
$BR
$BR
Finally, when the top of the ladder is $y0 ft above the ground,
the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall is  
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) = \{ans_rule(20)\} ft/s $ECENTER
