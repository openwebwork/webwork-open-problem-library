The knowledge \(K\) (measured in volumes of research published) that a civilization can amass per year is proportional to the knowledge it currently possesses. Suppose that this civilization can continuously add $percent% to its knowledge each year and that it possesses \($iv \) volumes of knowledge at time \(t=0\). A differential equation that models the amount of knowledge the civilization possesses is
