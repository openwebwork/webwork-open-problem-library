BEGIN_TEXT
Jen decides that the second derivative is statistically close enough to being constant that the first derivative must be linear. She then fits a linear regression to the $BBOLD first $EBOLD derivative data \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}\), using $time[0] as time 0:
$BR
\(y^\prime \approx \) \{ans_rule\}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD When you enter data into your calculator it will show the data in the table rounded off. However, it stores the data in the full precision you enter, and calculates the regression from the full precision. It is important then that you enter the data with as many decimal places as you computed above, or WeBWorK may not like your answer regression equation.
$BR
$BR
Jen then integrated her linear regression to get a quadratic regression for y:
$BR
\(y \approx \) \{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
$BR
According to her model, Jen's data is at a max at time t = \{ans_rule\} and the maximum value is \{ans_rule\}
