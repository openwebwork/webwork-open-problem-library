#  Solution

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${BBOLD}A.${EBOLD} True since \(f\) differentiable on an open interval implies \( f \) is continuous on an open interval.
$BR
${BBOLD}B.${EBOLD} False since continuity of \( f \) requires a two-sided limit at \( x = a \).
$BR
${BBOLD}C.${EBOLD} True since \(f\) is continuous on \( (a,b) \).
$BR
${BBOLD}D.${EBOLD} False since \(f'\) differentiable on \( (a,b) \) means 
\( f'' \) exists on \( (a,b) \).
