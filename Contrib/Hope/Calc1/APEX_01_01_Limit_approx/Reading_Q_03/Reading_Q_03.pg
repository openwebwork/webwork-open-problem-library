Consider the following three graphs of the same function [`y=f(x)`].

a. The graph below at zoom level 1x leads us to believe that the limit of [`f(x)`] as [`x`] nears [`1`] [_]{$popup2a}

    [@ image( "Limit_DNE_zooming_01.png", width=>300, height=>162, tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="1x zoom."' ) @]*

b. The graph below at zoom level 10x leads us to believe that the limit of [`f(x)`] as [`x`] nears [`1`] [_]{$popup2b}

    [@ image( "Limit_DNE_zooming_02.png", width=>300, height=>162, tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="10x zoom."' ) @]*

c. The graph below at zoom level 100x leads us to believe that the limit of [`f(x)`] as [`x`] nears [`1`] [_]{$popup2c}

    [@ image( "Limit_DNE_zooming_03.png", width=>300, height=>162, tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="100x zoom."' ) @]*

d. We conclude that the limit of [`f(x)`] as [`x`] nears [`1`] [_]{$popup2d}
