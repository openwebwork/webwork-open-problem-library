clevis and pin 01
$PAR
A mechanical connection known as a clevis and pin is shown. The dimensions of the assembly are given as:
$PAR
a = $a mm $BR
b = $b mm $BR
c = $c mm $BR
d = $d mm $BR
t = $t mm $BR
W = $W mm $BR
L = $L mm
$PAR
In order to avoid failure in the materials used to create the parts:
$PAR
-The normal stress in the pin must be limited to $NSpin MPa. $BR
-The shearing stress in the pin must be limited to $SSpin MPa. $BR
-The normal stress in the tongue must be limited to $NStongue MPa. $BR
-The shearing stress in the tongue must be limited to $SStongue MPa. $BR
-The normal stress in the clevis must be limited to $NSclevis MPa. $BR
-The shearing stress in the clevis must be limited to $SSclevis MPa.
$PAR
Find the maximum force \(F\) that can be applied if:
$PAR
(a) the assembly fails due to the pin shearing $BR
(b) the assembly fails due to tearout of the tongue $BR
(c) the assembly fails due to tearout of the clevis $BR
(d) the assembly fails due to tensile failure of the tongue $BR
(e) the assembly fails due to tensile failure of the clevis $BR
(f) the assembly fails due to the average bearing stress between the tongue and the pin $BR
(g) the assembly fails due to the average bearing stress between the clevis and the pin $BR
(h) all of these modes of failure are considered.
$PAR
\{ image("clevis_and_pin_01.png", width=>387, height=>338, tex_size=>600) \}

$PAR
(a) \(F_{pin-shear}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(b) \(F_{tongue-tearout}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(c) \(F_{clevis-tearout}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(d) \(F_{tongue-tensile}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(e) \(F_{clevis-tensile}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(f) \(F_{tongue-pin-bearing}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(g) \(F_{clevis-pin-bearing}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(h) \(F_{overall-allowable}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
$BITALIC 
be sure to include units with your answers $PAR
neglect stress concentration effects $PAR
for parts a-g, assume the assembly doesn't fail in another mode first $PAR
assume all parts fit together with minimal clearances
