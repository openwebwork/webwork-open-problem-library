compressor feet 01
$PAR
Rubber feet are attached to the legs of the compressor shown for vibration isolation. The dimensions of the feet are:
$PAR
W = $W in $BR
L = $L in $BR
H = $H in
$PAR
When the compressor is running, a dial indicator is used to find that the compressor shakes left and right symmetrically about its equilibrium position with a peak-to-peak movement of $d inches. Assuming the rest of the compressor is rigid, find the average shearing strain in the feet when they are at their peak deflection.
