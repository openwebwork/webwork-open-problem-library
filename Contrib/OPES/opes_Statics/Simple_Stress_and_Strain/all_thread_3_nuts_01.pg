Nuts installed on a piece of all-thread experience the following forces in service:
$PAR
\{ begintable(4) \}
\{ row( "\(F_A\)","\(F_B\)",
        "\(F_C\)","\(F_D\)") \}
\{ row( "$SPACE $FA kip $SPACE","$SPACE $FB kip $SPACE",

The length of each segment is given by:
$PAR
\{ begintable(3) \}
\{ row( "$BBOLD a $EBOLD","$BBOLD b $EBOLD",
        "$BBOLD c $EBOLD") \}
\{ row( "$SPACE $a in $SPACE ","$SPACE $b in $SPACE ",

\{ endtable() \}
$PAR

If the all-thread is composed of a material that has an elastic modulus of $E ksi, and its effective diameter is $d inches, determine the following:
$PAR
(a) The maximum normal stress in this piece of all-thread. $BR
(b) The change in length of segment AB. $BR
(c) The change in length of segment BC. $BR
(d) The change in length of segment CD. $BR
(e) The change in length of the whole length of all-thread.
$PAR
Under the following assumptions:
$PAR
\(\bullet\) Bearing stress between threads of the all-thread and the nut may be neglected $BR
\(\bullet\) Stress concentration effects may be neglected $BR
\(\bullet\) The forces that the nuts apply may be treated as concentrated forces at each location. $BR
\(\bullet\) The nuts may be treated as rigid. $BR
\(\bullet\) The force applied to each nut is distributed evenly around the nut's perimeter.
