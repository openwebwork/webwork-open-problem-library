stalled car 01
$PAR
Forces are applied to two ropes which are attached to the bumper of a stalled car. If \(F_1\) = $F1 lbs at an angle of \(\theta_1\) = $theta1 degrees, find the necessary magnitude and direction of force \(F_2\) so that the resultant force is $RESULTANT lbs in the direction shown.
