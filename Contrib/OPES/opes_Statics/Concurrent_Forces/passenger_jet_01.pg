passenger jet 01 $Fx, $Fy, $A
$PAR
The passenger jet shown experiences four forces as shown. The wings provide a lift force of \(F_{lift}\) = $Flift kN. The engines provide a thrust force of \(F_{thrust}\) = $Fthrust kN. Air resistance applies a drag force of \(F_{drag}\) = $Fdrag kN. The plane weighs \(F_{weight}\) = $Fweight kN. The jet is pitched \(\theta\) = $theta degrees from horizontal. Find the magnitude and direction (with respect to the positive x' axis) of the resultant force acting on the jet.
