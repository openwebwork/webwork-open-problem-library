3D struts 01
$PAR

Ball joints connect the ends of each of the struts shown. The resulting structure supports a force of \(F\) = $F N which lies in the xz plane. The dimensions of this arrangement are:
$PAR
a = $a cm $BR
b = $b cm $BR
c = $c cm $BR
d = $d cm $BR
g = $g cm $BR
h = $h cm $BR
k = $k cm $PAR
Find the force in each strut. Denote compressive forces with negative values and tensile forces with positive values.

$PAR

$PAR  
\(F_{AB}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}

\(F_{AC}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR 
\(F_{AD}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
