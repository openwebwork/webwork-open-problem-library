inverted king post 01
$PAR
The truss shown is called a king-post truss. It is inverted, such that the structure lies below the plane of the supports. Find the reactions at the supports and the forces carried in each member when a force of \(F\) = $F kN is applied and the dimensions of the truss are given below.
