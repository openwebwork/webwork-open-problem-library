Clamps like the one shown are commonly used in woodworking applications. This clamp has the dimensions given above, and its jaws are $t mm wide (in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the picture). The screws of the clamp are adjusted so that there is a uniform pressure of $P kPa being applied to the workpieces by the jaws. Find the force carried in each screw.
