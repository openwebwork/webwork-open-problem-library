$BBOLD$BITALIC Problem Statement: $EBOLD$EITALIC$BR
Member AB spans two supports that are a = $a m apart. It is subjected to a distributed load of w = $w N/m and a concentrated moment of M = $M N*m as shown. The member will have a diameter of b = $b mm, and the material that composes the member must not be stressed above a normal stress of $sigma_allowable MPa. Find the maximum allowable side length$BITALIC c$EITALIC of a square hole in the cross-section oriented at 45 degrees as shown. (Neglect the shearing stresses in the member.)
