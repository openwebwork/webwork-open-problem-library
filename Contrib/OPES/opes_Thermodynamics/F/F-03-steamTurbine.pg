## outlet conditions given. Students are asked to identify another outlet
## property (directly from the saturation tables) and calculate the turbine

$PAR

The inlet conditions of the steam are: $PAR
pressure = $P1 MPa $PAR
temperature = $T1 \(^\circ\)C $PAR
velocity = $velocity1 m/s $PAR

$PAR

The exit conditions are: $PAR
pressure = $P2 kPa $PAR
quality = $x2 $PAR
velocity = $velocity2 m/s $PAR

$PAR


a) What is the temperature of the fluid at the turbine exit? \{ ans_rule(10)\}
