$PAR

An adiabatic pump is used to feed water to a municipal storage tower. Water at
$Twater\(^\circ\)F is drawn from a nearby river at a rate of $mDot lbm/s and pumped to an elevation of $hWater ft. The water tower is vented, so that the pressure within the tower remains at atmospheric pressure. Neglecting any inefficiencies, what size of pump (in hp) will be needed? $PAR
