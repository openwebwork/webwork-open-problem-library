## NOTES : Compressor problem with ideal gas. Two cases are given: 
## adiabatic, and with heat loss. Straightforward solution by solving 
## the general first law equation for the mass flow rate, then applying 
## the ideal gas law at the exit.

$PAR

Helium is to be compressed from $P1 kPa and $T1 K to $P2 kPa and $T2 K. If the compressor can generate up to $Power kW of mechanical energy, what is the maximum volumetric flow rate of gas leaving the compressor that will still be at the desired exit conditions, if: $PAR

$PAR

a) the compressor is adiabatic? \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}}\) $PAR

$PAR

b) the compressor leaks $PowerLoss kW of heat out into the surrounding air? \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}}\) $PAR
