Scientists have engineered a new hydrocarbon fuel that generates $ENERGYDENSITY Btu from every fluid ounce that is burned. At room temperature, this fuel has a density of $MASSDENSITY \( \displaystyle \frac{\text{lbm}}{\text{ft}^3} \). What is the heating value of this fuel in \( \displaystyle \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}\)?
