## NOTES : In this problem students will get first look at a 
## very common conversion in Thermo. Historically, students 
## will make this 1000x mistake even well into the course. 
## This problem will help them practice the correct conversion.

Engineers are evaluating the installation of a wind turbine farm in a location where the average wind speed is $VELOCITY \( \displaystyle \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \). What is the kinetic energy of the wind when traveling that fast, in \( \displaystyle \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}} \)? (HINT - Kinetic Energy Formula: K.E.= \( \displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\text{mv}^2 \))
