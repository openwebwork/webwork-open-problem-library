$PAR
THIS MAY BE WORKING, BUT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED!!!
$PAR
In a metal recycling plant, heat is to be removed from the area surrounding the furnace with a refrigeration unit operating on the ideal vapor-compression cycle. You as the engineer are asked to recommend a system, and you need to decide between a water-based unit and one that uses R-134a as the working fluid. For a number of reasons, the evaporator must be at $Plo kPa and the condenser at $Phi kPa. You must design for a cooling load of $QL kW. $PAR
(a) With water, what flow rate will be required? \{ ans_rule(10)\} kg/s $PAR 
(b) With R-134a, what flow rate will be required? \{ ans_rule(10)\} kg/s $PAR 
(c) With water, how much work will the compressor require? \{ ans_rule(10)\} kW $PAR 
(d) With R-134a, how much work will the compressor require? \{ ans_rule(10)\} kW $PAR
