You recently purchased and installed a $QL BTU window AC unit in your apartment (HINT: Search the internet for the definition of BTU ratings for HVAC systems). At full capacity, it consumes $WinSI W of electricity. $PAR
(a) How much heat is being dumped out of your window? \{ ans_rule(10)\} Btu/hr $PAR
(b) What is the COP of your AC unit? \{ ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) If your apartment is $AREA ft<sup>2</sup>, with $HEIGHT ft ceilings, and it is $T1\(^\circ\)F when you turn on the AC, what will be the temperature after $TIME minutes? (Assume the apartment is sealed, and ignore the radiative and convective effects from the furnishings. Make other reasonable assumptions as needed.) $PAR
