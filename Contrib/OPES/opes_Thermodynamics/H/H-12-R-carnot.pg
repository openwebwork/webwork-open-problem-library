$PAR
A commercial heat pump is used to maintain a building at $TL_F \(^\circ\)F when the average outside temperature is $TH_F \(^\circ\)F. Because of heat leaking through the walls and fenestrations, this will require a cooling load of $QL Btu/hr. In order to receive an Energy Star rating by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), heat pumps of this size must have a seasonal average efficiency value (called SEER) of at least 13. That is equivalent to an average COP of $COP. $PAR
(a) Assuming that the COP is constant during the entire season, and that the average price for electricity is $DOLLAR $costElec per kWh, how much will it cost to run the unit for $hours hours per day for $days days under these temperature and load conditions? $PAR
$DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) If the heat pump had no irreversibilities at all, what would be the cost? $PAR
(HINT: you need to determine what COP this would yield) $PAR
 $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
