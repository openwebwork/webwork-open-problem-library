Your company wants to build a warehouse. Your responsibility is to suggest heating system that will be able to keep it at $TEMP \(^\circ\)C throughout the winter. You don't expect the outside temperature to drop below -3 \(^\circ\)C. Based on the insulative properties of the building materials, your conservative estimate for heat loss is $Qloss kW on the coldest day. Your company does not want the heating system to consume more than $Win kW. As you decide on the best system to recommend, what is the minimum COP that would be acceptable under these conditions? $PAR
