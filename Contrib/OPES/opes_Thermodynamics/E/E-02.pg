## NOTES : This is a constant volume process. Both the temperature 
## and the pressure are going to increase. The two critical knowns 
## at (1) are the % liquid (which is NOT quality) and the pressure. 
## The two critical knowns at (2) are the specific volume and the 
## phase (sat. liq).

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR

An insulated rigid tank contains a saturated liquid-vapor mix of water initially at a pressure of $P1 kPa. The mass of the mixture is $mass kg, but only $liquidPercent \(%\) of the total mass is liquid. An electric resistance heater is turned on within the tank until all the water has vaporized. The heater power is a constant $heaterPower kW. 

$PAR

$PAR

a) What is the volume of the container? \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \text{m}^3\) $PAR
b) How long was the heater on? \{ ans_rule(10)\} minutes $PAR
