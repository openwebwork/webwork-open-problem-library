## NOTES : This is a simple Q=m*c*(T2-T1) problem with a twist. It 
## combines the boiling off of water with the heating of ceramic. 
## Hasty students may not consider that liquid water can only be heated 
## to 100C at atmospheric pressure, and then requires added heat to 
## vaporize it. This additional enthalpy of vaporization is quite 
## significant, even in light of the relatively minute amount of water present.

A small ceramic crucible normally weighs $massCeramic kg. However, after it has been washed and rinsed, it weighs $massTotal kg. This indicates that there is still some moisture present. Before it can be reused in a sensitive vacuum chamber, it must be absolutely dry. To ensure that no residual water is present, the crucible is heated to $T2 \(^\circ\)C from room temperature ($T1 \(^\circ\)C). If it takes $hfgWater kJ to vaporize one kg of water at atmospheric pressure, how much heat will be required for this drying process? (Approximate the specific heat of ceramic as $cCeramic kJ/kg*K, and of liquid water as $cWater kJ/kg*K) $PAR
