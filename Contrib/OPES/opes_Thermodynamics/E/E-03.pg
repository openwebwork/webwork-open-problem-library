## calculate the cost of the energy needed to boil water. Being 
## in common US units, there are a number of conversions that are 
## required. There is no real complexity to this problem.

You are throwing a dinner party and decide to prepare instant Chinese noodles (chicken flavor) for all your guests. From the cooking instruction on the back of the package, you determine that you will need to bring $numCups cups of water to a boil for your noodles. You will be cooking on a propane stove, which isn't very efficient. In fact, only $heatEfficiency \(%\) of the heat generated at the burner is actually used to heat the water in the pot. You would like to know how much money you will have to spend on propane to bring the water to a boil up from a room temperature of $roomTemp \(^\circ\) F. Note: you will turn off the propane right when the water begins to boil.
 
$PAR

Actual values: $PAR
Propane has a heating value of $LHV Btu/lbm.

$PAR

You can expect to buy propane at $3.90/gallon. $PAR

$PAR

The density of propane is 4.114 lbm/gallon. $PAR

$PAR

Assume the density of the water is a constant $density_water lbm/gallon.

$PAR

a) How much water will need to be heated? \{ ans_rule(10)\} pounds $PAR

$PAR

b) How much heat must the water absorb to raise its temperature to the boiling point? \{ ans_rule(10)\} Btu $PAR

$PAR

c) How much propane will be consumed? \{ ans_rule(10)\} gallons $PAR

$PAR

d) How much is the cost of that much propane? $ \{ ans_rule(10)\}
