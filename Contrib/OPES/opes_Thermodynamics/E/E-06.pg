## NOTES : The key here is realizing that the specific volume is 
## constant. Once that is calculated for the given final conditions, 
## the students can simply scan for the two values (from the saturated 
## water tables) that bound this specific volume. Students will need to
## interpolate on the superheated tables and also on the saturation tables.
