## NOTES : This problem can be divided into three processes: an isochoric 
## process until the pressure reaches the lifting pressure of the piston, 
## an isobaric process until the piston reaches the mouth of the cylinder, 
## and a free expansion after that. During the isochoric process, the 
## temperature and pressure will rise as the water remains a saturated 
## liquid. As the piston lifts, the temperature and pressure remain 
## constant. The quality moves up from 0 to a low value (<0.1). By 
## determining its volume and specific volume when the piston is at the very 
## top of the cylinder (still sealed), the internal energy can be calculated.
## The internal energy is the only property that remains constant during the 
## free expansion. Along with the final pressure (given), the final specific 
## volume can be calculated. The presentation of units for the final pressure 
## of MPa was chosen to be intentionally vague. Students should not assume 
## that the final state is a saturated mixture (it is), but use the property 
## values to determine if it is superheated or otherwise.

$PAR

A weighted piston (total mass of $massPiston kg), resting on stops in a cylinder (radius of $radius m) divides a container into two regions. $massWater kg of saturated liquid water at $T0 \(^\circ\)C is contained beneath the piston. The rest of the cylinder and container is evacuated. Heat is applied to the water until the piston is lifted off of the stops and moved a distance (\(y\)) of $y m. As the piston reaches the mouth of the cylinder, the hermetic seal is broken and the cylinder contents can now expand to fill the remainder of the evacuated space. At this instant, no additional heat is added to or removed from the system. When the system fully equilibrates, its absolute pressure is measured to be $P3 MPa.  $PAR
