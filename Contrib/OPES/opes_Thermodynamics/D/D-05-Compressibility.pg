## NOTES : This problem addresses the compressibility factor for 
## gases near their critical pressure and temperature. This is 
## straightforward. However, hasty students may forget to convert 
# from MPa and be wrong by three orders of magnitude.

$PAR

Near the critical temperature and critical pressure of a gas, it will behave quite like an ideal gas except that its density will be higher than predicted by the Ideal Gas Law. Based on what you know of this "compressibilty" behavior, what will be the volume in \(\displaystyle\text{m}^3\) of $MASS kg of $GAS if it is at a temperature of $TEMP K, and a pressure of $PRESSURE MPa?
