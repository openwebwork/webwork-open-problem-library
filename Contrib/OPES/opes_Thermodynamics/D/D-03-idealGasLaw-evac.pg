## NOTES : This problem involves an expanding volume of gas 
## (without work). Students must realize that the mass remains 
## constant during the process. Alert students will realize the 
## immediate relationship between specific volume and volume.

$MASS kg of helium is constrained within one portion of an insulated container,such that it fills a volume of only $VOLUME \(\text{m}^3\). A barrier divides the helium from the rest of the container, which is completely evacuated. For some unknown reason, the barrier ruptures. As a result, the helium expands to fill the entire container. The temperature of the helium remains a constant $TEMPERATURE K before, during, and after the expansion. If the specific volume of the helium increases by a factor of $FACTOR during the expansion, what is the final pressure of the helium in kPa?
