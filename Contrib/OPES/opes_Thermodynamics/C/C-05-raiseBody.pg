## NOTES : This problem highlights a different kind of power. 
## Rather than changing velocity at a particular elevation, this 
## problem deals with a constant vertical velocity. Students will 
## need to recognize the rate component of the elevation to arrive 
## at the correct solution. Also, there is some mention of Factor 
## of Safety here. However, enough contextual information is given 
## such that prior discussion is not needed.

$PAR
A high-speed elevator is being designed that must be able to travel at a maximum speed of $ASCENTRATE \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}\). You are asked to recommend the lift motor to use. The completely furnished carriage will have a mass of $MASSELEVATOR pounds. The design occupancy limit will be eight people weighing an average of 200 pounds. Since there will always be some unknowns in the actual operation of the elevator, use a Factor of Safety of 2. In other words, recommend a motor that has exactly twice the power rating needed (based on all the design limit specifications). How big of a motor, in hp, should you you recommend?
