Pumps are generally used to increase the pressure of a liquid. This is done by converting rotating shaft work (within the pump) into mechanical energy (of the liquid). Within such a pump, the energy of the liquid is being increased by $MECHENERGY kW, while the pump is expending $SHAFTWORK kW of energy. What is the mechanical efficiency of the pump?
