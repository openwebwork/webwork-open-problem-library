$PAR
A \($L\) H inductor is in parallel with a \($R \Omega\) resistor.  The inductor current is $I A at $BITALIC t = 0 $EITALIC.  Find:
$BR (a) \(i_L(0.8 ms)\)

$PAR
If another \($R \Omega\) resistor is connected in parallel with the inductor at $BITALIC t = 1 $EITALIC ms, find:
$BR (b) \(i_L(2 ms)\)

$PAR  
(A) \(i_L(0.8 ms)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
$PAR
(B) \(i_L(2 ms) \) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
