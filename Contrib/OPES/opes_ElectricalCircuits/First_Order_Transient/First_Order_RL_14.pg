Problem 1
$PAR
The circuit shown consists of a resistance \(R = $R \Omega\) and an inductance \(L = $L H\). At t = 0, the inductance is storing $w mJ of energy. Calculate
$BR
(a) \(i\) at t = 1s;
$BR
(b) \(i\) at t = 5s;
$BR
(c) \(i\) at t = 10s;
$BR
(d) the energy remaining in the inductance at t = 2s.
