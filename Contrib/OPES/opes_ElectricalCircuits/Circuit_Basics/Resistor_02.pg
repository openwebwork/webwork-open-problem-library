$PAR
A certain voltage is + $V V for $t ms and -$V V for the succeeding $t ms and continues oscillating back and forth between these two values at $t2 ms intervals. 
$BR The voltage is present across a $R \(\Omega\) resistor. 
$PAR Over any $t2 ms interval, find:
$BR (a) the maximum value of the voltage
$BR (b) the average value of the voltage
$BR (c) the average value of the resistor current
$BR (d) the maximum value of the absorbed power
$BR (e) the average value of the absorbed power.
$PAR

$PAR  
(a) \(V_{max}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V
$PAR  
(b) \(V_{avg}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V
$PAR
(c) \(i_{avg}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
$PAR
(d) \(P_{max}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} W
$PAR
(e) \(P_{avg}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} W
