$PAR
If the current \(i(t)\) for an element is \($I1 t\) A for \(t \le 0\), and \($I2 t\) A for \(t \ge 0\).
$PAR

Find:
$BR
(a) \( i($T1) \)
$BR
(b) \( i($T2) \)
$BR
(c) The total charge that has passed through the element in the interval \( $T1 \le t \le $T2 \)
$BR
(d) The average current that has passed through the element in the interval \( $T1 \le t \le $T2 \).

$PAR
(a) : \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
