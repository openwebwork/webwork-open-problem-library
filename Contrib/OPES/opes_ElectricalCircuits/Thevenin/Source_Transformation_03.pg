$PAR
A certain practical dc voltage source can provide a current of $isc A when it is (momentarily) short- circuited, and can provide of $pl W to a 20 \(\Omega\) load. Find $BR (a) The open-circuit voltage
$BR (b) The maximum power it could deliver to a well-chosen \(R_L\) 
$BR (c) What is the value of that \(R_L\)?

$PAR
\(V_{oc}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V
$PAR 
\(P_{max}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} W
$PAR
\(R_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\Omega\)
