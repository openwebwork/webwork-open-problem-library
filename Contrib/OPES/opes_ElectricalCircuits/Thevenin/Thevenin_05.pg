Problem 2
$PAR
For the circuit below:
$BR (a) Find the Thevenin equivalent (Assume the voltage source has plus on top)
$BR (b) What power would be delivered to a load of \($R \Omega\) connected between terminals $BITALIC a $EITALIC and $BITALIC b $EITALIC?
$PAR

\{ image("Thevenin_05.png", width=>400, height=>139, tex_size=>900) \}
$BR

$PAR  
(A) \(v_s\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V; \(R_s\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\Omega\)
$PAR  
(B) \(P_{$R\Omega}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} W
