$PAR
A certain practical current source provides $P1 W to a $R1 \(\Omega\) load.  That same practical current source provides $P2 W to an $R2 \(\Omega\) load. If the same practical current source had a resistance \(R_L\) is connected to it, creating a voltage across \(R_L\) of \(v_L\) and  a current through \(R_L\) of \(i_L\). Find the values of \(R_L\), \(v_L\), and \(i_L\) if 
$BR (a) \(v_L \times i_L\) is maximum
$BR (b) \(v_L\) is a maximum
$BR (c) \(i_L\) is a maximum.
$PAR

(a) \(R_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\Omega\) , \(v_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V , \(i_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A

$PAR  
(b) \(R_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\Omega\) , \(v_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V , \(i_L\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
