$PAR
The three-wire system shown below with each leg \((V_{an} \mbox{ and } V_{nb})\) operating at 180 \(V_{RMS}\) and 60 Hz supplies power to three loads:
$PAR
Load \(Z_{AN}\) draws a complex power of (\(12 \angle 50^o \) ) kVA
$BR
Load \(Z_{NB}\) draws a complex power of (\(6 \angle 15^o \) ) kVA
$BR
Load \(Z_{AB}\) draws a complex power of (\(6 \angle -70^o \) ) kVA
