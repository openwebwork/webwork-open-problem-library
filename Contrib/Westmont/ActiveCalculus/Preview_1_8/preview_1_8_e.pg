BEGIN_TEXT
The line tangent to the graph of \( g(x) = $g \) at the point \(($x0, $gx0)\) is given by the
formula 
\[L(x) =  $dgx0(x - $x0) + $gx0. \]
These functions are graphed below.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
\(L(x)\) is the linear approximation to \(g(x)\) at the point \(($x0,$gx0)\), so both functions pass 
through this point, and the slope of the line equals \(g'($x0)\). The linear approximation is approximately equal to the function near the point of approximation, but away from that point it may not be.
