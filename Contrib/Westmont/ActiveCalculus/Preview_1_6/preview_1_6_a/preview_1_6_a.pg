The position of a car driving along a straight road at time \(t\) in
minutes is given by the function \(y = s(t)\) that is pictured below. The car's position
function has units measured in thousands of feet. For instance, the point \((2, 4)\) on the
graph indicates that after \(2\) minutes, the car has traveled \(4000\) feet. $PAR

$BR
In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time
interval. In particular, you should carefully discuss what is happening on each of
the time intervals \([0, 1]\), \([1, 2]\), \([2, 3]\), \([3, 4]\), and \([4, 5]\), plus provide commentary
overall on what the car is doing on the interval \([0, 12]\).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
On the interval  \([2, 3]\), the car is stopped, because its position function is constant
on this interval. Similarly, the car is stopped three other times, indicating that it is driving
in city traffic during the interval \([0, 12]\). Between each stop, the car manages to travel 4000 feet.
On both of the intervals  \([0, 1]\) and \([3,4]\), the car is accelerating from rest. On both of these 
intervals, the car manages to travel 2000 feet. On the intervals  \([1, 2]\) and \([4, 5]\), the car is
slowing down from its top speed and coming to a stop. 
Similarly, the car manages to travel 2000 feet during these 1-minute intervals.
