Recall that the derivative \(g'(x)\) is also a function; you just computed five values of this function. On a piece of scratch paper, sketch a rough graph of \(y=g'(x)\).
Which of the following best describes the graph of the $BBOLD derivative $EBOLD \(y=g'(x)\)? $BR

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The slope of each line is the rise divided by the run. For the first two lines, count the number
of horizontal squares corresponding to a rise of 1: roughly, this gives 5.5 and 3, so 
\(g'(-2) \approx 1/5.5 \) and \(g'(-1)\approx 1/3\). Adequate estimates for the other slopes 
could be \(g'(0) \approx 1.5/2\), \(g'(1) \approx 3/2.2\), and \(g'(2) \approx 3/1.2\). These rough
estimates all
produce answers within 10% of the correct answers, which are \(g'(-2) = $dgn2\),  \(g'(-1) = $dgn1\),  \(g'(0) = $dg0\),  \(g'(1) = $dg1\),  and \(g'(2) = $dg2\). Since these values are getting larger, and getting larger at an increasing rate, the graph of \(y=g'(x)\) is increasing and concave up.
