One of the longest stretches of straight (and flat) road in North
America can be found on the Great Plains in the state of North Dakota on state highway
46, which lies just south of the interstate highway I-94 and runs through the town of Gackle.
A car leaves town (at time \(t = 0\)) and heads east on highway 46; its position in miles from
Gackle at time \(t\) in minutes is given by the graph of the function shown below. Three
important points are labeled on the graph; where the curve looks linear, assume that it is
indeed a straight line. $BR

$BR
In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time
interval. In particular, discuss what is happening on the time intervals \([57, 68]\)
and \([68, 104]\).

 The car travels at a constant speed for 57 minutes. Then it stops for 6.8 minutes (during the 
interval \([57,68]\). It then travels at a constant speed for 36 more minutes (on the time interval \([68,104]\)), and then it stops again at time \(t=104\). $PAR
