Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity, a differential equation naturally arises.  In the following problem, we see such a scenario; we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.
$PAR
Suppose you have a bank account in which money grows at an
  annual rate of 3\%.
$PAR
(i) If you have \(\$10,000\) in the account, at what rate is your
      money growing? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(ii) Suppose that you are also withdrawing money from the account
      at \(\$1,000\) per year.  What is the rate of change in the amount
      of money in the account?  What are the units on this rate of change?  $BR
