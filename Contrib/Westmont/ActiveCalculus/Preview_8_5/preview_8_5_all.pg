It can be shown how to approximate the number \(e\) using linear, quadratic, and other 
polynomial functions; the same techneques can be used to approximate \(\ln(2)\). In this 
activity, we review and extend the process to find the "best" quadratic approximation to 
the exponential function \(e^x\) around the origin. Let \(f(x) = e^x\) throughout this activity.

The linearlization of \(f = e^x\) at \(x=0\) is \(P_1(x) =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$PAR
(We label this linearization \(P_1\) because it is a first degree polynomial approximation.) 
Recall that \(P_1(x)\) is a good approximation to \(f(x)\) for values of \(x\) close to \(0\). 
On your own, plot \(f\) and \(P_1\) near \(x=0\) to illustrate this fact.
$PAR

$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD $PAR

Since \(f(x) = e^x\) is not linear, the linear approximation eventually is not a very good one. 
To obtain better approximations, we want to develop a different approximation that "bends" 
to make it more closely fit the graph of \(f\) near \(x=0\). To do so, we  add a quadratic term 
to \(P_1(x)\). In other words, we let
\[P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2x^2\]
for some real number \(c_2\). We need to determine the value  of \(c_2\) that makes the graph of 
\(P_2(x)\) best fit the graph of \(f(x)\) near \(x=0\).
$PAR

Remember that \(P_1(x)\) was a good linear approximation to \(f(x)\) near \(0\); this is because 
\(P_1(0) = f(0)\) and \(P'_1(0) = f'(0)\). It is therefore reasonable to seek a value of \(c_2\) so that
\begin{align}
P_2(0) &= f(0), \\
P'_2(0) &= f'(0), \ \mbox{and} \\
P''_2(0) &= f''(0).
\end{align}
Remember, we are letting \(P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2x^2\). Let \(c = c_2\) and calculate the following 
(in other words, if you need to use \(c_2\) in your answer, use \(c\) instead.)
$PAR

    \(P_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}; $BR
    \(P'_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f'(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\};$BR
    \(P''_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f''(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}.$PAR


   	Notice that \(P''_2(0)\) is in terms of \(c_2\). Find a value for \(c_2\) so that \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\). $BR
   	\(c_2=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
   	$PAR

    Think about why the condition \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\) will put an appropriate "bend" in the 
    graph of \(P_2\) to make \(P_2\) fit the graph of \(f\) around \(x=0\).

We know that
\[P_1(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x = 1+x.\]
Since \(P_1(0) = f(0) = 1\) and \(P'_1(0) = f'(0) = 1\), the graphs of \(P_1\) and \(f\) agree at \(x=0\) and have the same slope at \(x=0\) (which means they go in the same direction at \(x=0\)). This is why \(P_1(x)\) is a good approximation to \(f(x)\) for values of \(x\) close to \(0\).
$PAR

Since
\[P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2(x)^2 = f(0) + f'(0)x + c_2x^2\]
we have that
\[P_2(0) = 1 = f(0)\]
as desired.
$PAR

A simple calculation shows \(P'_2(x) = P'_1(x) + 2c_2x\). So \(P'_2(0) = P'_1(0) = 1 = f'(0)\) as desired.
$PAR

A simple calculation shows \(P''_2(x) = 2c_2\). So \(P''_2(0) = 2c_2\). To have \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\) we must have \(2c_2 = f''(0)\) or \(c_2 = \frac{f''(0)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\).
$PAR

The second derivative of a function tells us the concavity of the function. Concavity measures how the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of the function are changing. This tells us how much bend there is in the graph. So if  \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\), then \(P_2\) will have the same bend in it at \(x=0\) as \(f\) does. This will make the graph of \(P_2\) mold to the graph of \(f\) around \(x=0\).
