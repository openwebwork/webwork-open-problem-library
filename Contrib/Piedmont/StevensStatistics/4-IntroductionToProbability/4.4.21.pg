BEGIN_TEXT

Use the extended multiplication rule to calculate the following
probabilities.
$PAR

(a) If you flip a coin $n1 times, what is the probability of getting $n1
heads.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) If you randomly select $n2 people, what is the probability that they
were born on the same day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ... Sunday)?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Assume that your car starts 99$PERCENT of the time. What is the
probability that your car will start for the next $n3 days in a row?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
