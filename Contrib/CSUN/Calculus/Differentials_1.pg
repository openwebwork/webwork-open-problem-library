According to Poiseuille's Law, the volume of blood per unit time that flows past a given position in a blood vessel is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. In other words, \(F = kr^4\), where \(F\) is the flux, \(r\) is the radius, and \(k\) is a constant. If \(r\) changes by $a percent, use differentials to approximate the percentage change in \(F\).
