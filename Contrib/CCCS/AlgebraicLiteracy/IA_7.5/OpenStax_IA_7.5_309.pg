#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
Josephine can corect her students test papers in [`[$t1]`] hours, but if her teacher's assistant helps, it would take them [`[$T]`] hours.  How long would it take the assistant to do the job alone? Round to the nearest tenth of an hour.

Time: [_______________]{$t2}hours [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*



END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = time it takes the assistant to complete the task

In [$T] hours, Josephie will complete [`\frac{[$T]}{[$t1]}`]-th of the job.

In [$T] hours, the assistant will complete [`\frac{[$T]}{x}`]-th of the job.

Together, they will have completed one set of papers in [$T] hours:

[`\displaystyle \frac{[$T]}{[$t1]} + \frac{[$T]}{x} = 1`]

Multiply every term by [`[$lcd]`] to clear the fractions.

[`[$T]x + [$const] = [$lcd]`]

[`[$const] = [$coeff]x`]

[`x = [$t2]`]
