BEGIN_PGML

Vartan was paid [$t] for a cell phone app that he wrote and wants to invest it to save for his son’s education. He wants to put some of the money into a bond that pays 4% annual interest and the rest into stocks that pay 9% annual interest. If he wants to earn 7.4% annual interest on the total amount, how much money should he invest in each account? Be sure to include the dollar sign in your answer. 

Amount in 4% bond: [_________________]{$f} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Amount in 9% stocks: [_________________]{$n} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*
