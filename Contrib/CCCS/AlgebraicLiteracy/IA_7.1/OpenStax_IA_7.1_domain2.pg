BEGIN_PGML

For each function below:
a.  Determine the values of x for which the rational expression is undefined. If there is more than one value, enter your answers as a comma separated list.  If there is no value that makes the expression undefined enter "NONE".
b.  Find the domain of the function.  Write your answer in interval notation. Use INF for [`\infty`].



[`f(x) = [$f1]`]
a.  The expression is undefined when [`x =`] [_______]{$ans1}
b.  The domain of [`f`] is [______]{$domain1}



[`g(x) = [$f2]`]
a.  The expression is undefined when [`x =`] [_______]{$ans2}
b.  The domain of [`g`] is [______]{$domain2}

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Division by zero is undefined, so to determine where a rational expression is undefined set the denominator = 0.  

For [`f(x)`]:

[`x + [$b1]=0`]

[`x = [$ans1]`]

The domain is the set of all numbers where the function is NOT undefined.  That would be every number except for [`x = [$ans1]`].  In interval notation this is [`[$domain1]`].

We can do the same thing for the 2nd function, [`g(x)`].  Start by setting the denominator to zero:

[`x^2 + [$middle]x + [$last] = 0`]

We can solve this equation by factoring.  Find two numbers that have a product of [`[$last]`] and a sum of [`[$middle]`].  Those numbers are [`[$a2]`] and [`[$b2]`].

[`(x + [$a2])(x + [$b2]) = 0`]

Now we can set the factors to zero to get:

[`x = [$ans2]`]

The domain would be all numbers, except for [`-[$a2]`] and [`-[$b2]`].  In interval notation this is [`[$domain2]`].
