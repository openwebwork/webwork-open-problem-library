BEGIN_PGML
For the function,

[`f(x) = [$f]`]

(a)  Find all zeros.  If there is more than one zero, enter them as a comma separated list.

[`x=`] [_________________]{$ans} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

(b)  Find all x-intercepts.  If there is more than one, enter them as comma separated ordered pairs of the form (a, b), (c, d).

[`x`]-intercept(s): [_________________]{$xint} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("points") @]*

(c) Find all y-intercepts.  If there is more than one, enter them as comma separated ordered pairs of the for (a, b), (c, d).

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part A:

To find zeros of a function, we set it equal to zero:

[`[$f] = 0`]


Find two numbers with a product of [`[$first]\cdot[$last]=[$prod]`] and a sum of [`[$middle]`].  Those numbers are [$ac] and [$b].

[`[$first]x^2 + [$ac]x + [$b]x + [$last] = 0`]

[`[$a]x(x + [$c]) + [$b](x + [$c]) = 0`]

[`([$a]x + [$b])(x + [$c]) = 0`]

[`[$a]x + [$b] = 0`] or [`x + [$c] = 0`]

[`x = [$ans]`]

Part B:
To find x-intercepts, we set [`y = 0`]

[`[$f] = 0`]

We found the solutions to this equation in Part A to be [`x = [$ans]`].  That means the x-intercepts are located at [`[$xint]`].

Part C:
To find y-intercepts, we set [`x = 0`]

[`f(0) = [$first](0)^2 + [$middle]\cdot 0 + [$last] = [$last]`]

The y-intercept is located at [`[$yint]`].
