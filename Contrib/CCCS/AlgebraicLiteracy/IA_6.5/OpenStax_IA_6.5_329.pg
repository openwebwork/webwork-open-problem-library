BEGIN_PGML
A pennant is shaped like a right triangle with hypotenuse [`[$h[$i]]`] feet.  The length of one side of the pennant is [`[$n[$i]]`] feet longer than the length of the other side.  Find the length of the two sides (legs) of the pennant.  Enter your answers as a comma separated list.

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Since the pennant is a right triangle, we can use the pythagorean formula [`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`] to set up an equation for this problem.

The hypotenuse is [`[$h[$i]]`] feet:

[`c = [$h[$i]]`]

One leg is [`[$n[$i]]`] feet longer than the other one:

[`a = x`]

[`b = x + [$n[$i]]`]

[`x^2 + (x + [$n[$i]])^2 = [$h[$i]]^2`]

Expand:

[`x^2 + [$b2] = [$c2]`]

[`[$LHS] = [$c2]`]

Set one side to zero:

[`[$Eqn] = 0`]

We can factor out a 2:

[`2(x^2 + [$middle]x + [$last]) = 0`]

Then find two numbers with a product of [$last] and a sum of [$middle].  Those numbers are [`-[$a]`] and [`[$b]`].

[`2(x - [$a])(x + [$b]) = 0`]

[`x = [$a]`] or [`x = -[$b]`]

It doesn't make sense to have negative length, so [`x = [$a]`].

To find the third side of the triangle, plug that answer into [`b = x + [$n[$i]]`].

[`b = [$a] + [$n[$i]] = [$b]`]

The sides of the triangle and [$a] feet and [$b] feet.
