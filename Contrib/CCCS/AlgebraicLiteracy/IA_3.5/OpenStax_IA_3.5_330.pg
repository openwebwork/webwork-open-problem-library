#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
Every day a new puzzle is downloaded into Ken's account.  Right now, he has [`[$n]`] puzzles in his account.  The function [`N(t) = [$n] + t`] represents the relation between the number of puzzles, [`N`] and time, [`t`], measured in days.  Find [`N([$i])`] and explain what this result means.

[`N([$i]) = `][______]{$ans1}

This result gives:

[@ $radio->buttons() @]*
