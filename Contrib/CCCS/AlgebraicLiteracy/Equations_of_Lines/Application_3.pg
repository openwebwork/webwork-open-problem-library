#  Main text
 
BEGIN_PGML
The number of acres in the National Park system has grown from [`[$yint]`] million acres in [`[$year1]`] to [`[$y2]`] million acres in [`[$year2]`].  Let y represent the number of acres, in millions, in the system and x the number of years after [`[$year1]`]. Find a linear equation that fits the data.

[`y = `][____]{$ans}  [@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*

#  Solution
 
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let x = years since [$year1] and y = millions of acres in the NPS.

In [$year1], there were [`[$yint]`] million acres.  This corresponds to the ordered pair [`(0, [$yint])`].

In [$year2], there were [`[$y2]`] million acres.  [$year2] is [$n] years after [$year1], so this corresponds to the ordered pair [`( [$n], [$y2])`].

We can find the slope

[`m = \frac{[$y2] - [$yint]}{[$n] - 0} = [$slope]`]

and use the point-slope formula to find the equation:

[`y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)`]

[`y - [$yint] = [$slope](x - 0)`]

[`y = [$slope]x + [$yint]`]
