BEGIN_PGML
George bought a car for [`$[$value1]`] in [`[$year1]`].  In [`[$year2]`], the car was worth [`$[$value2]`].  

Express the value, [`y`], of the car in terms of the number of years, [`x`] after it was purchased.

[`y = `][____]{$ans}  [@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*

Use your formula to predict the value of the car in [`[$year3]`].

[_____]{$value3}

#  Solution
 
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let x = years since [$year1] and y = the value of the car.

In [$year1], the car was worth [`$[$value1]`].  This corresponds to the ordered pair [`(0, [$value1])`].

In [$year2], the car was worth [`$[$value2]`].  [$year2] is [$i] years after [$year1], so this corresponds to the ordered pair [`( [$i], [$value2])`].

We can find the slope

[`m = \frac{[$value2] - [$value1]}{[$i] - 0} = [$slope]`]

and use the point-slope formula to find the equation:

[`y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)`]

[`y - [$value1] = [$slope](x - 0)`]

[`y = [$slope]x + [$value1]`]

To find the car's value in [$year3], plug [$n] into the above equation.  ([$year3] is [$n] years after [$year1].)

[`y = [$slope]\cdot [$n] + [$value1]`]

[`y = [$value3]`]
