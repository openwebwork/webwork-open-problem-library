BEGIN_PGML
After four years in college Josie owes [`$[$total]`] in student loans.  The interest rate on the federal loans is [`[$i1]%`] and the rate on the private loans is [`[$i2]%`].  The total interest she owes for one year was [`$[$interest]`].  What is the amount of each loan?

Amount of federal loan: $[_______________]{$ans1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Amount of private loan: $[_______________]{$ans2} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = the amount borrowed at [$i1]%

y = the amount borrowed at [$i2]%

The total amount invested is $[$total].

[`x + y = [$total]`]

The amount of interest owed is $[$interest].

[`[$coeff1]x + [$coeff2]y = [$interest]`]

Multiply the first equation by -[$coeff1] and add them together.

[`-[$coeff1]x - [$coeff1]y = [$RHS1]`]

[`[$coeff1]x + [$coeff2]y = [$interest]`]

[`[$coeff]y = [$RHS]`]

[`y = [$ans2]`]

Plug this into any equation to get [`x = [$ans1]`].

$[$ans1] was borrowed at [$i1]% and $[$ans2] was borrowed at [$i2]%.
