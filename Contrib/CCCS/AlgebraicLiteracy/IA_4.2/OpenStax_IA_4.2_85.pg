#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
June needs [`[$total]`] gallons of punch for a party and has two different coolers to carry it in. The bigger coolers is [`[$n]`] times larger than the smaller cooler.  How many gallons can each cooler hold?

Number of gallons in smaller cooler: [_______________]{$ans1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Number of gallons in larger cooler: [_______________]{$ans2} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*



END_PGML


############################
#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let L = number of gallons in the larger cooler and S = number of gallons in the smaller cooler.

The total number of gallons needed is [$total]:

[`L + S = [$total]`]

The larger cooler is [$n] times larger than the smaller cooler:

[`L = [$n]S`]

Using substitution to solve:

[`[$n]S + S = [$total]`]

[`[$Coeff]S = [$total]`]

[`S = [$ans1]`]

[`L = [$n] \cdot [$ans1] = [$ans2]`]

She will need [$ans1] gallons in the smaller cooler and [$ans2] gallons in the larger cooler.
