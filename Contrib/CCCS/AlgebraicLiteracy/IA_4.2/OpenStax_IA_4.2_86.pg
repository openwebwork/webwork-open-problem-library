BEGIN_PGML
Shelly spent [`[$jog1]`] minutes jogging and [`[$bike1]`] minutes cycling and burned [`[$cal1]`] calories. The next day, she spent [`[$jog2]`] minutes jogging and [`[$bike2]`] minutes cycling and burned [`[$cal2]`] calories.  How many calories were burned for each minute of jogging and how many for each minute of cycling?

Number of cal/min burned jogging: [_______________]{$ans1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Number of cal/min burned cycling: [_______________]{$ans2} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let J = the number cal/min burned jogging and C = the number of cal/min burned cycling.

If she spent [$jog1] minutes jogging and [$bike1] minutes cycling and burned a total of [$cal1]:

[`[$jog1]J + [$bike1]C = [$cal1]`]

Later she spent [$jog2] minutes jogging and [$bike2] minutes cycling and burned a total of [$cal2]:

[`[$jog2]J + [$bike2]C = [$cal2]`]

If we multiply the first equation by [$j1], it becomes:

[`[$Eqn1] = [$RHS1]`]

Multiply the second equation by [$j2] to get:

[`[$Eqn2] = [$RHS2]`]

Add those equations together and the J-terms add to zero.  We are left with:

[`[$Eqn] = [$RHS]`]

[`C = [$ans2]`]

Plug this into any of the equations to get [`J = [$ans1]`].

Shelly burns [$ans1] cal/min jogging and [$ans2] cal/min cycling.
