BEGIN_PGML
Darrin is hanging [`[$total]`] feet of holiday garland on the three sides of fencing that enclose his front yard.  The length is [`[$n]`] feet less than three times the width.  Find the length and width of his yard.

Width: [_______________]{$ans1} feet [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Length: [_______________]{$ans2} feet [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let L = the length of his yard and W = the width of his yard.

There are only three sides of his yard that have fencing, one side L and two sides W.  The total amount of fencing/garland is [$total] feet.

[`L + 2W = [$total]`]

The length is [$n] feet less than three times the width.

[`L = 3W - [$n]`]

Using substitution,

[`3W - [$n] + 2W = [$total]`]

[`5W - [$n] = [$total]`]

[`5W = [$RHS]`]

[`W = [$ans1]`]

[`L = 3 \cdot [$ans1] - [$n] = [$ans2]`]

His yard has a length of [$ans2] feet and a width of [$ans1] feet.
