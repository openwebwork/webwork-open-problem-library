BEGIN_PGML
Owen is making lemonade from concentrate.  The number of quarts of water he needs is [`[$n]`] times the quarts of concentrate.  How many quarts of water and how many quarts of concentrate will he need to make [`[$total]`] quarts of lemonade.

Number of quarts of water: [_______________]{$ans1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Number of quarts of concentrate: [_______________]{$ans2} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let W = number of quarts of water needed and C = number of quarts of concentrate needed.

The total number of quarts needed is [$total]:

[`W + C = [$total]`]

The amount of water (W) is (=) [$n] times the amount of concentrate (C):

[`W = [$n]C`]

Using substitution to solve:

[`[$n]C + C = [$total]`]

[`[$Coeff]C = [$total]`]

[`C = [$ans2]`]

[`W = [$n] \cdot [$ans2] = [$ans1]`]

Owen needs [$ans1] quarts of water and [$ans2] quarts of concentrate.
