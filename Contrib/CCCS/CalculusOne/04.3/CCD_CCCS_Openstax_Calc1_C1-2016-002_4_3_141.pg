$b=random(5,10,1);

$time=$a/9.8;
$height=-4.9*($time)*($time)+$a*$time+$b;

BEGIN_PGML

A ball is thrown into the air and its position is given by [`h(t) =-4.9t^2+[$a] t+[$b]`], where `t` is measured in seconds and `h(t)` is measured in meters above the ground. Find the height at which the ball stops ascending. How long after it is thrown does this happen?

a) Time at which ball stops ascending is [________________]{$time} seconds. [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]* 

b) Height at which ball stops ascending is [________________]{$height} meters.  [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*
