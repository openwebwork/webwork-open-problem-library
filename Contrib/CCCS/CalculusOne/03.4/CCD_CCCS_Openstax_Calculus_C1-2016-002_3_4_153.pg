BEGIN_PGML

A rocket is fired vertically upward from the ground. 
The distance `s` in feet that the rocket travels from the ground after `t` seconds is given by 
[` s(t) = [$s] `]. Find the velocity and acceleration of the rocket `[$c]` seconds after being fired.


The velocity of the rocket `[$c]` seconds after being fired is
[_______________]{$velo}   [`ft/s`]. [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*


The acceleration of the rocket `[$c]` seconds after being fired is
[_______________]{$acc}   [`ft/s^2`]. [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

END_PGML

#################
BEGIN_PGML_HINT

If the position function is represented by [`s(t)`] then the velocity is represented by [`v(t)=s'(t)`] and the accelerated is represented by [`a(t)=s''(t)`].
