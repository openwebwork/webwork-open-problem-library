A `[$a]` foot ladder is leaning against a wall. If the top of the ladder slides down the wall at a rate of `[$b]` feet per second, how fast is the bottom moving along the ground when the bottom of the ladder is `[$c]` feet from the wall?

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Some good steps to follow for related rate problems:
1. Read through the problem at least two times.
2. Draw a picture and label appropriately. (things that are changing over time should be labeled with variables)
3. Write out what you know and what you don't know (given rates, given values, etc.)
4. Find an equation that relates the rates.
5. Differentiate that equation with respect to time.
6. Plug in what you know to solve for what you don't know.


For this particular ladder problem:
Label the sides that have changing lengths with variables, say `x` and `y`. Then use Pythagorean theorem to relate the rates. 

[`x^2+y^2 = [$a$]^2`]

Then take the derivative with respect to `t` of both sides of the equation.

[`2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 0`]

Then plug in the rates and values you are given to solve for the unknown. (It looks like you are given `x=[$c]` and so you will need to find what `y` equals before you can plug in all of your known values to solve for the unknown value.)
