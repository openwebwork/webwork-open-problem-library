A [$a] foot tall person walks away from a [$b] foot tall lamppost at a constant rate of [$c] feet per second.

(a) What is the rate that the tip of the shadow moves away from the person when the person is [$d] feet away from the pole? ``[_______________________________]{$ansperson} ft/sec [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]* 

(b) What is the rate that the tip of the shadow moves away from the lamppost when the person is [$d] feet away from the pole? ``[_______________________________]{$anspost} ft/sec [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Some good steps to follow for related rate problems:
1. Read through the problem at least two times.
2. Draw a picture and label appropriately. (things that are changing over time should be labeled with variables)
3. Write out what you know and what you don't know (given rates, given values, etc.)
4. Find an equation that relates the rates.
5. Differentiate that equation with respect to time.
6. Plug in what you know to solve for what you don't know.


For this problem, notice that the rate at which the tip of the shadow moves away from the person is [`\frac{dx}{dt}`], while the rate at which the tip of the shadow moves away from the lamppost is [`\frac{dx}{dt} +\frac{dy}{dt}`]
