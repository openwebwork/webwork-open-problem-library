BEGIN_PGML

Two buses are driving in opposite directions along parallel freeways that are [`d =[$a]`] miles apart. Assuming that each bus drives at a constant [$b] miles per hour, find the rate at which the distance between the buses is changing when the distance between them is [`z =[$c]`] miles, heading toward each other.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Some good steps to follow for related rate problems:
1. Read through the problem at least two times.
2. Draw a picture and label appropriately. (things that are changing over time should be labeled with variables)
3. Write out what you know and what you don't know (given rates, given values, etc.)
4. Find an equation that relates the rates.
5. Differentiate that equation with respect to time.
6. Plug in what you know to solve for what you don't know.
