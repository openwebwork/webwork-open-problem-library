BEGIN_TEXT
Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of \( y = x^3 \) and \(y = $a x\) using integration. Determine the area by integrating over the x-axis or y-axis, whichever seems more convenient.  Answers should be exact. As a suggestion, graph the equations so you can see the region for which you are solving for the area.

Area of region \(A\) = \{ans_rule(30) \}
