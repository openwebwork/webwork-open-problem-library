#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

Given that [` \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\ x^n = [$gs] `]

use term by term differentiation or integration to find the power series for

[` \displaystyle f(x)=[$f] `] centered at [`x=0`].


The power series representation for [`f(x)`] is [``\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}``][__________________________]{$ans}[@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*


(Hint: A power series must have all nonnegative integers as the exponenets for the variable, so you may need to reindex the power series you find after differentiating.)
