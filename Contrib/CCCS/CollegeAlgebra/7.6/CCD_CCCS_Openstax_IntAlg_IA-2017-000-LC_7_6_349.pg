BEGIN_PGML_HINT

It may be helpful to rewrite the inequality so that you have a single rational expression isolated and zero on the other side of the inequality.

Example: Solve the rational inequality 
[` \dfrac{x}{x-2} >3`]

Solution:

[``
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{x}{x-2} &>3\\
\dfrac{x}{x-2} -3&>0\\
\dfrac{x}{x-2}-\dfrac{3(x-2)}{x-2}&>0\\
\dfrac{-2x+6}{x-2}&>0
\end{aligned}
``]

The rational expression on the left side of this inequality is undefined when [`x=2`] and is equal to zero when [`x=3`].

We now want to find when the rational expression is positive and when it is negative. 

Looking at the interval [`(-\infty, 2)`], we can see that those [`x`] values make the rational expression [`\dfrac{-2x+6}{x-2}`] negative.

Looking at the interval [`(2, 3)`], we can see that those [`x`] values make the rational expression [`\dfrac{-2x+6}{x-2}`] positive.

Looking at the interval [`(2, \infty)`], we can see that those [`x`] values make the rational expression [`\dfrac{-2x+6}{x-2}`] negative.

Since we are looking for[`\dfrac{-2x+6}{x-2}>0`], or where the rational expression is positive, then we can see the solution is [`(2,3)`].
