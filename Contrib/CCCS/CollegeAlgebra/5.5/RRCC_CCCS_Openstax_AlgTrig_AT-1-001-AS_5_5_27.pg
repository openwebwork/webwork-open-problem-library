BEGIN_PGML_HINT
*The Rational Zero Theorem:* If the polynomial [`f(x) = a_nx^n +a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0`] has integer coefficients, then every tational zero of [`f(x)`] has the form [`\frac{p}{q}`] where [`p`] is a factor of the constant term [`a_0`] and [`q`] is a factor of the leading coefficent [`a_n`].

*Steps to find all rational zeros of a polynomial function using the Rational Zero Theorem and synthetic division*

1. Determine all factors of the constant term and all factors of the leading coefficient.
2. Determine all possible values of [`\frac{p}{q}`] where [`p`] is a factor of the constant term [`a_0`] and [`q`] is a factor of the leading coefficent [`a_n`]. Be sure to include both positive and negative candidates.
3. Use synthetic division to evaluate a given possible zero by synthetically dividing the candidate into the polynomial. If the remainder is [`0`], the candidate is a zero. If the remainder is not zero, discard the candidate.
4. Repeat step two using the quotient found with synthetic division. If possible, continue until the quotient is a quadratic.
4. Find the zeros of the quadratic function. Two possible methods for solving quadratics are factoring or using the quadratic formula.
