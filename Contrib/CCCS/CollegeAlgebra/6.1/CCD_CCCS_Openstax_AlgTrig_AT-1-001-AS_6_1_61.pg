BEGIN_PGML

The fox population in a certain region has an annual growth rate of [$a]% per year.  In the year 2012, there were [$b] foxes counted in the area.  

Write a function, [`f(t)`], that models the number of foxes in the population at [`t`] years after 2012.  Assume a continuous growth rate.

[`f(t)=`][_______________]{$ans1}   [@ AnswerFormatHelp("formula") @]*


What is the fox population predicted to be in 2020?

[_______________]{$ans2}  [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
*Continuous Growht/Decay Formula*

Continuous growth or decay is represented by the formula

[`` A(t) = ae^{rt}``]
where
+ [`a`] is the initial value,
+ [`r`] is the continuous growth rate per unit time,
+ and [`t`] is the elapsed time.

If [`r>0`], then the formula represents continuous growth. If [`r<0`] then the formula represents continuous decay.
