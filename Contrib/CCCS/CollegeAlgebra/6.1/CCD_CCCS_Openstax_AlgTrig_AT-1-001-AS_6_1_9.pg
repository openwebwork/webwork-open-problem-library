#  Main text
BEGIN_PGML

For the following exercises, consider this scenario: 

For each year [`t`], the number of trees in Forest A is represented by the function  [`A(t)=[$a](1.015)^t `].  In the nearby Forest B, the number of trees is represented by the function [`B(t)=[$b](1.025)^t `].


1. Which forest's population is growing at a faster rate?
[_________________]{$popup2} 

2. Which forest had a greater number of trees initially?
[_________________]{$popup1} 

3. Initially, by how many trees did the larger forest exceed the smaller forest?
[_________________]{$ans1}

4. Which forest will have a greater number of trees after 30 years?
[_________________]{$popup2} 

5. After 30 years, by how many trees will the larger forest exceed the smaller forest?  Round to two decimal places.
[_________________]{$ans2}
