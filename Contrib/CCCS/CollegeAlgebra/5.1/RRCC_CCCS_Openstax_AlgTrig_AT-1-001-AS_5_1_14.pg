BEGIN_PGML
Determine whether[`f(x)= [$f] `] has a minimum or maximum value, and find the value of the minimum or maximum. Also, find the axis of symmetry.

The value of the [____________]{$popup1}  is [_____________]{$ans1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

The axis of symmetry for [`f(x)`] is given by [___]{$popup2} [_____________]{$ans2}[@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function is the line that defines where the parabola is symmetric about. The axis of symmetry is the straight line that goes through the vertex of the parabola.

A quadratic function of the form [`f(x) = a(x-h)^2+k`] has a vertex at the point [`(h,k)`] and the axis of symmetry is the line [`x=h`].

A quadratic function of the form [`f(x) = a(x-h)^2+k`] will have a minimum value if [`a`] is positive because that would mean the parabola faces upward.

A quadratic function of the form [`f(x) = a(x-h)^2+k`] will have a maxmimum value if [`a`] is negative because that would mean the parabola faces downward.
