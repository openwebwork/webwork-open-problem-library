# Parameters

$P0 = random(15000,30000,1000); #initial population
$a = random(8000,18000,1000);
$b = Compute("$P0+$a"); #population after 5 years
$c = Compute("$b + 3*$a"); #end population
$k = Compute("ln($b/$P0)/5"); #continuous growth rate value, not as a percent


#$P0 = sprintf("%0.0f", $P0); #initial population rounded to the nearest integer, forces students to round to nearest integer, they are marked incorrect if they dont round.
#$P0 = Round($P0); #initial population rounded to the nearest integer, forces students to round to nearest integer, they are marked incorrect if they dont round.
#$P0 = Round($P0,1); #rounded to one decimal, but does not force students to actually round, they are still marked correct if they do not round to one decimal place.

$time=Compute("ln($c/$P0)/$k"); #doubling time unrounded
$time = sprintf("%0.0f", $time); #doubling time rounded to the nearest integer

BEGIN_PGML

The population of a certain city was [`[$P0]`], then 5 years later the pouplation was [`[$b]`].

END_PGML

Section::Begin("Part 1");

Context("LimitedNumeric");

BEGIN_PGML

Write the exponential function representing this scenario modeled as a continuous growth model.

 [`P(t) = `][_______________]{$f}  [@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
*Continuous Growht/Decay Formula*
Continuous growth or decay is represented by the formula

[`` A(t) = ae^{rt}``]
where
+ [`a`] is the initial value,
+ [`r`] is the continuous growth rate per unit time,
+ and [`t`] is the elapsed time.

If [`r>0`], then the formula represents continuous growth. If [`r<0`] then the formula represents continuous decay.

For this problem, you are given the initial population of [`[$P0]`] and the total population after 5 years. 

With this information, you can set up the continuous growth model as: 

[`` P(t) = [$P0]e^{rt}``]

Then use the data from 5 years later

[`` [$b] = [$P0]e^{r\cdot 5}``]

to solve for the continuous growth rate [`r`].

Then you have all the information you need to write the exponential function representing this scenario.
