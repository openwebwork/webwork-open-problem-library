BEGIN_PGML
A certain radioactive isotope has a half-life of [`{[$hl]}`] minutes.  If we initially have 
[`{[$w]}`] grams of this substance, how many half-lives will pass until [`{[$u]}`] grams remain?  Your answer should be a whole number.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Each time the initial amount cuts in half, one half-life has passed.

For example, if the initial amount was 24 grams, and we wanted to know how many half-lives will pass to get to 3 grams, we can notice that 

[`24/2 = 12`] (one half-life has passed)

[`12/2 = 6`] (two half-lives have passed)

[`6/2 = 3`] (three half-lives have passed)

So a total of three half-lives would have passed to get to 3 grams.

BEGIN_PGML

What length of time is needed for this decay process to occur? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.

 [_______________]{$ans2} minutes

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Some formulas that might be helpful here:

The formula for a continuous exponential model is [`A(t) = A_0e^{kt}`] where [`k<0`] means exponential decay.

If we have an exponential decay model, then the half life is [`t = -\frac{\ln(2)}{k}`]
