BEGIN_PGML

A vacant lot is being converted into a community garden.  The garden and a walkway around its perimeter have an area of [$a] square feet.  Find the width of the walkway if the garden measures 12 feet wide by 15 feet long.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Here you need to determine the width of the walkway, `x`. 

The total length of the garden and the walkway would be `x+15+x` and the total width of the garden and the walkway would be `x+12+x`. You are also given the total area of the garden and the walkway. 

Now, can you use that information to set up an equation for the total area of the garden and the walkway? Then, can you solve that equation to answer the question?
