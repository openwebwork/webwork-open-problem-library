#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

A car and truck are driving in opposite directions on a straight section of highway.  If the car is traveling at [`[$cspeed]`] mph and the truck is moving at [`[$tspeed]`] mph, when will the vehicles be [`[$distance]`] miles apart?

[`t = `] [________]{$time} hours

END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
*D = RT*

x = the time the vehicles are traveling for.

In x hours, the car has traveled [`[$cspeed] \cdot x`] miles.  In x hours, the truck has traveled [`[$tspeed] \cdot x`] miles.

The total distance is [$distance] miles:

[`[$cspeed]x + [$tspeed]x = [$distance]`]

[`[$sum]x = [$distance]`]

[`x = [$time]`] hours
