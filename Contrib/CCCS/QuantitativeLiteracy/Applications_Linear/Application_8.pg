#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

Stephanie walks [`[$walk]`] minutes to meet her jogging partner and then jogs for [`[$jog]`] minutes. Her jogging rate was twice as fast as her walking rate.  If she walked and jogged a total of [`[$total]`] feet, how fast did she jog?

Jogging Speed = [__________]{$jspeed} ft per minute

END_PGML


############################
#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We don't know how fast she is walking or how fast she is jogging.

`x` = walking speed

`2x` = jogging speed

*D = RT*

Distance she walked = [`x \cdot [$walk] = [$walk]x`]

Distance she jogged = [`2x \cdot [$jog] = [$j]x`]

The total distance she traveled was [$total].

[`[$walk]x + [$j]x = [$total]`]

[`[$lhs]x = [$total]`]

[`x = [$wspeed]`]

She walks at a rate of [$wspeed] ft/min and jogs at a rate of [`2 \cdot [$wspeed] = [$jspeed]`] ft/min.
