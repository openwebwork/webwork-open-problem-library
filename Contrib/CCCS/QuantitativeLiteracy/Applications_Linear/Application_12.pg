#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

Pam earned grades of [$grade1] and [$grade2] on her first two math tests.  After taking the third test, her test average is [$average].  What grade did she get on the third test?

grade = [_______]{$grade3}

END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = Pam's grade on her third test.

To find an average, we add up the test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

[``Average = \frac{Test\;1 + Test\;2 + Test\;3}{3}``]

[``\frac{[$grade1]+[$grade2] +x}{3} = [$average]``]

[``\frac{[$sum]+x}{3} = [$average]``]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:

[`[$sum] + x = [$rhs]`]

[`x = [$grade3]`]
