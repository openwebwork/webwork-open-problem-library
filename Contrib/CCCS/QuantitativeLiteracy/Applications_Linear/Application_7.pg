BEGIN_PGML

A [$total]-inch party sub sandwich is cut into three pieces.  The first piece is [$factor] as long as the second piece.  The third piece is [$a] inches longer than the second piece.  Find the length of each piece.

First Piece = [________]{$first} inches

Second Piece = [_________]{$second} inches

Third Piece = [________]{$third} inches

END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First Piece = [`[$f]x`]

Second Piece = `x`

Third Piece = [`x + [$a]`]

The total is [$total]:

[`[$f]x + x + x + [$a] = [$total]`]

[`[$lhs]x + [$a] = [$total]`]

[`[$lhs]x = [$rhs]`]

[`x = [$second]`]

First = [`[$f]\cdot [$second] = [$first]`] inches

Second = [`[$second]`] inches

Third = [`[$second] + [$a] = [$third]`] inches
