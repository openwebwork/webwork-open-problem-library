BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Key words to look for:

*increased by* means addition.  The number increased by [$a] would be [`x + [$a]`].

*less than* is subtraction, but pay attention to order! [$a] less than a number: [`x - [$a]`]

*difference* is also subtraction.  The difference of [$a] and a number: [`[$a] - x`]

*product* means multiply.  The product of [$a] and a number: [`[$a]x`]

*quotient* is division.  The quotient of a number and [$a] is [`\frac{x}{[$a]}`].

*twice* means mulitply by two. But attention to which word the 'twice applies to.  For example:

Twice the sum of a number and [$a] is [`2(x + [$a])`] because the twice applies to the entire sum.

The sum of twice a number and [$a] is [`2x + [$a]`] becaue the twice only applies to the number x.

The correct answers are [$answerstring].
