#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

The Memorial Spartans scored [$pts] points more than the West Regents in a basketball game.  Together, both teams scored a total of [$total] points.  How many points did the Spartans score during this game?

Number points = [_________________]{$spartans} 

END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = the number of points scored by the Regents

x + [$pts] = the number of points scored by the Spartans

The total number of points is [`[$total]`]:

[`x + x + [$pts] = [$total]`]

[`2x + [$pts] = [$total]`]

[`2x = [$rhs]`]

[`x = [$rhs] \div 2 = [$regents]`]

The Spartans scored [`[$regents] + [$pts] = [$spartans]`] pts.
