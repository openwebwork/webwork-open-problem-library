BEGIN_PGML
The Jones family took a [`[$m]`] mile canoe ride down the Indian river in two hours. After lunch the return trip back up the river took three hours. Find the rate of the canoe in still water and the rate of the current.

Rate of the canoe in still water: [_______________]{$ans1} mph [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Rate of the current: [_______________]{$ans2} mph [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = rate of the canoe in still water

y = the rate of the current

When the boat is traveling with the current, its net speed is:  x + y

When it is traveling against the curent, its net speed is: x - y

Going with the current (downstream) [$m] miles was traveled in two hours. Since D = RT:

[`[$m] = (x + y) \cdot 2`]

Going against the current (upstream) [$m] miles was traveled in three hours.

[`[$m] = (x - y) \cdot 3`]

The equations are:

[`2x + 2y = [$m]`]

[`3x - 3y = [$m]`]

Multiply the first equation by 3 and the seocnd equation by 2:

[`6x - 6y = [$RHS1]`]

[`6x - 6y = [$RHS2]`]

[`12x = [$RHS]`]

[`x = [$ans1]`]

Plug this into any equation to get [`y = [$ans2]`].

The canoe is moving at [$ans1] mph in still water and the current is moving at [$ans2] mph.
