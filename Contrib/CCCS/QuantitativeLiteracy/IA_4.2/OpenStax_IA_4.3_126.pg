BEGIN_PGML
Tickets to a Broadway show cost [`$[$a]`] for adults and [`$[$c]`] for children.  The total receipts for [`[$n]`] tickets at one performance were [`$[$total]`].  How many adult and child tickets were sold?

Number of Adult tickets: [_______________]{$adult} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

Number of Child tickets: [_______________]{$child} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a = the number of adult tickets sold.

c = the number of child tickets sold.

The total number of tickets sold was [$n].

[`a + c = [$n]`]

The total amount of money brought in was $[$total].

[`[$a]a + [$c]c = [$total]`]

Multiply the first equation by -[$c] and add them together:

[`-[$c]a + -[$c]c = [$RHS1]`]

[`[$a]a + [$c]c = [$total]`]

[`[$Coeff]a = [$RHS]`]

[`a = [$adult]`]

Plug this into any equation to get [`c = [$child]`].

[$adult] adults and [$child] children bought tickets.
