#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
Jackie has been offered positions by two cable companies.  The first company pays a salary of [`$[$base1]`] and a commission of [`$[$comm1]`] for each cable package sold. The second pays a salary of [`$[$base2]`] plus a commission of [`$[$comm2]`] for each package sold. How many cable packages would need to be sold to make the total pay the same?

Number of Cable Packages: [_______________]{$ans1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*



END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let y = total salary and x = number of cable packages sold.  

Then the first company's salary with x packages sold is:

[`y = [$base1] + [$comm1]x`]

The second company's salary with x packages sold is:

[`y = [$base2] + [$comm2]x`]

We can use substitution to solve:

[`[$base1] + [$comm1]x = [$base2] + [$comm2]x`]

[`[$Coeff]x = [$RHS]`]

[`x = [$x]`]

She must sell [$x] packages for the salaries to be equal.
