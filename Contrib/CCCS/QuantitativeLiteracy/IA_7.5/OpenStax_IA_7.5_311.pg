#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
At the end of the day Dodie can clean her hair salon in [`[$t1]`] minutes.  Ann, who works with her, can clean the salon in [`[$t2]`] minutes.  How long would it take them to clean the shop if they work together? Round to the nearest tenth.

Time: [_______________]{$ans}minutes [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*



END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = time it takes them working together 

In x hours, Dodie will complete [`\frac{x}{[$t1]}`]-th of the job.

In x hours, Ann will complete [`\frac{x}{[$t2]}`]-th of the job.

Together, they will have cleaned one salon in x hours:

[`\displaystyle \frac{x}{[$t1]} + \frac{x}{[$t2]} = 1`]

Multiply every term by [`[$lcd]`] to clear the fractions.

[`[$t2]x + [$t1]x = [$lcd]`]

[`[$sum]x = [$lcd]`]

[`x = [$ans]`]
