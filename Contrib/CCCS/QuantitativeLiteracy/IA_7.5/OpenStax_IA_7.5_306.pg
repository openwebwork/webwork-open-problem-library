#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
It takes Sam [`[$t1]`] hours to rake the front lawn while his brother, Dave, can rake the lawn in [`[$t2]`] hours. How long will it take them to rake the lawn working together?  Round to the nearest tenth.

Time: [_______________]{$ans}hours [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*



END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = time it takes them working together 

In x hours, Sam will complete [`\frac{x}{[$t1]}`]-th of the job.

In x hours, Dave will complete [`\frac{x}{[$t2]}`]-th of the job.

Together, they will have completed one yard in x hours:

[`\displaystyle \frac{x}{[$t1]} + \frac{x}{[$t2]} = 1`]

Multiply every term by [`[$lcd]`] to clear the fractions.

[`[$t2]x + [$t1]x = [$lcd]`]

[`[$sum]x = [$lcd]`]

[`x = [$ans]`]
