BEGIN_PGML
A boat travels [`[$dw]`] miles downstream in the same time as it travels [`[$da]`] miles upstream.  The speed of the current is [`[$w]`] mph. What is the speed of the boat?

Speed: [_______________]{$a}mph [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let x = speed of the boat

When the boat travels against the current (upstream), its net speed is:

x - [$w]

When the boat travels with the current (downstream), its net speed is:

x + [$w]

Since [`D = RT`], [`T = \frac{D}{R}`]

The time it takes the boat to travel [$da] miles against the current is:

[`\frac{[$da]}{x - [$w]}`]

The time it takes the boat to travel [$dw] miles with the current is:

[`\frac{[$dw]}{x + [$w]}`]

Since these times are equal, we can write the equation:

[`\displaystyle \frac{[$da]}{x - [$w]} = \frac{[$dw]}{x + [$w]}`]

Set the cross product equal:

[`[$da](x + [$w]) = [$dw](x - [$w])`]

[`[$left] = [$right]`]

[`[$coeff]x = [$const]`]

[`x = [$a]`]
