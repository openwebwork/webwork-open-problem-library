#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
Ronald can shovel the driveway in [`[$t1]`] minutes, but if his brother Donald helps it would take [`[$T]`] minutes.  How long would it take Donald to shovel the driveway alone? Round to the nearest tenth.

Time: [_______________]{$t2}minutes [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*



END_PGML

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
x = time it takes Donald shovel alone

In [$T] hours, Ronald will complete [`\frac{[$T]}{[$t1]}`]-th of the job.

In [$T] hours, Donald will complete [`\frac{[$T]}{x}`]-th of the job.

Together, they will have completed one driveway in [$T] hours:

[`\displaystyle \frac{[$T]}{[$t1]} + \frac{[$T]}{x} = 1`]

Multiply every term by [`[$lcd]`] to clear the fractions.

[`[$T]x + [$const] = [$lcd]`]

[`[$const] = [$coeff]x`]

[`x = [$t2]`]
