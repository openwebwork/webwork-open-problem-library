#  Main text
 
BEGIN_PGML
It cost a bicycle company [`$[$cost1]`] to make [`[$bikes1]`] bikes in its first month of operation and [`$[$cost2]`] to make [`[$bikes2]`] bikes during its second month.  Find a linear equation to express the company's monthly production cost, [`y`], in terms of the number, [`x`] of bikes it makes.

[`y = `][____]{$ans}  [@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*

#  Solution
 
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let x = number of bicycles and y = the company's monthly production cost.

It costs [`$[$cost1]`] to make [`[$bikes1]`], we can use the ordered pair [`([$bikes1], [$cost1])`].

It costs [`$[$cost2]`] to make [`[$bikes2]`], we can use the ordered pair [`([$bikes2], [$cost2])`].

That makes the slope,

[`m = \frac{[$cost2] - [$cost1]}{[$bikes2]-[$bikes1]} = [$slope]`]

and we can use the point-slope equation to get:

[`y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)`]

[`y - [$cost1] = [$slope](x - [$bikes1])`]

[`y - [$cost1] = [$LHS]`]

[`y = [$ans]`]
