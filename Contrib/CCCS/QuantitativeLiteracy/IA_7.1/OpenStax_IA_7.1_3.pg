BEGIN_PGML

Determine the values of x for which the rational expression is undefined.  If there is more than one value, enter your answers as a comma separated list.  If there is no value that makes the expression undefined enter "NONE".

[`[$f1]`]

[`x =`] [_______]{$ans1}

[`[$f2]`]

[`x =`] [_______]{$ans2}

#  Solution
BEGIN_HINT
Division by zero is undefined. To determine when a rational expression is undefined, set the denominator = 0.
END_HINT

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
PART A:

Rational expressions are undefined when the denominator is zero.

[`[$first]x^2 + [$middle]x + [$last] = 0`]

[`([$a1]x + [$b1])([$c1]x + [$d1]) = 0`]

[`[$a1]x + [$b1] = 0`] or [`[$c1]x + [$d1] = 0`]

[`x = [$ans1]`]

PART B:

[`x^2 + [$asq] = 0`]

[`x^2 = -[$asq]`]

You can't the square root of a negative number, so this equation has no solution.  There are no values of x that make this expression undefined.

In other words, when you square a number, you will always get a positive answer.  There is no number that can be squared to give -[$asq].
