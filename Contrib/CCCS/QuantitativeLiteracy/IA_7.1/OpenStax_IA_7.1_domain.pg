BEGIN_PGML

For each function below:
a.  Determine the values of x for which the rational expression is undefined. If there is more than one value, enter your answers as a comma separated list.  If there is no value that makes the expression undefined enter "NONE".
b.  Find the domain of the function.  Write your answer in interval notation. Use INF for [`\infty`].



[`f(x) = [$f1]`]
a.  The expression is undefined when [`x =`] [_______]{$ans1}
b.  The domain of [`f`] is [______]{$domain1}



[`g(x) = [$f2]`]
a.  The expression is undefined when [`x =`] [_______]{$ans2}
b.  The domain of [`g`] is [______]{$domain2}

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Division by zero is undefined, so to determine where a rational expression is undefined set the denominator = 0.  

For [`f(x)`]:

[`[$a1]x + [$b1]=0`]

[`[$a1]x = -[$b1]`]

[`x = [$ans1]`]

The domain is the set of all numbers where the function is NOT undefined.  That would be every number except for [`x = [$ans1]`].  In interval notation this is [`[$domain1]`].

We can do the same thing for the 2nd function, [`g(x)`].  Start by setting the denominator to zero:

[`x^2 + [$n2] = 0`]

[`x^2 = -[$n2]`]

There is no number that can be squared to give [`-[$n2]`].  Or if you try to solve for x by taking the square root of both sides, you won't get a real solution because we can't take the square root of a negative number. That means there are no values of x that make the expression undefined and the domain is all real numbers or [`[$domain2]`].
