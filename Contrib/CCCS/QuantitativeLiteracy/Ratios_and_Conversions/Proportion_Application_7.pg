# Proportion application

Context("LimitedNumeric");

$mpg = random(12, 30);
$gal = random(6, 10);
$mileage = $mpg*$gal;
$cost = random(2, 3, 0.01);
$total = $cost*$gal;

TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

Set up a proportion to solve the application problem. 

Jesse's car gets [$mpg] miles per gallon of gas. If Las Vegas is [$mileage] miles away, how many gallons of gas are needed to get there and then home? If gas is $[$cost] per gallon, what is the total cost of the gas for the trip?

Gas Needed:   [________]{$ans1} gallons

Cost of Gas: [________]{$ans2} dollars

 
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Jesse get [$mpg] miles per 1 gallon of gasoline.  We want to know how many gallons of gas she will need to drive to Las Vegas and back.  Las Vegas is [$mileage] miles away, so the roundtrip will be [`2 \cdot [$mileage] = [$rdtrip]`] miles.

Let x = the number of gallons of gas need to drive [$rdtrip] miles.  We can use the proportion:

[``\frac{[$mpg]}{1}=\frac{[$rdtrip]}{x}``]

Set the cross products equal:

[`[$mpg]x = [$rdtrip]\cdot 1`]

[`[$mpg]x = [$rdtrip]`]

[`x = [$rdtrip] \div [$mpg] = [$ans1]`]

If gas is [`$[$cost]`] per gallon, she will spend:

[`[$cost]\cdot [$ans1] = [$ans2]`]

Jesse will need [$ans1] gallons of gas and will spend $[$ans2] on gasoline.
