#  Setup

Context("Numeric");

# Problem can be factored as (x + a)(x + b) = 0
#Solutions are x = -a, -b
$a = non_zero_random(-10, 10, 2);
$b = non_zero_random (-10, 10);

#expanded form
$first = 1;
$middle = $a + $b;
$last = $a*$b;

#problem is x(x + c) = n(x + d)
#x^2 + (c - n)x -nd = 0
$n = 2;
$c = $middle + $n;
$d = $last/-$n;

$right = Compute("x(x + $c)")->reduce;
$left = Compute("$n(x + $d)")->reduce;

#For solution

BEGIN_PGML
Solve the quadratic equation [`[$right]=[$left] `] by factoring. If there is more 
than one correct answer, enter a comma 
separated list.

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First, distribute on both the left and right sides:
[`x^2 + [$c]x = [$n]x + [$m]`]

Then set the right hand side to zero by subtracting [`[$n]x`] and [`[$m]`] from both sides:

[`x^2 + [$middle]x + [$last] = 0`]

Now we can factor by looking for two numbers with a product of [`[$last]`] and a sum of [`[$middle]`].  Those numbers are [`[$a]`] and [`[$b]`].

[`(x + [$a])(x + [$b]) = 0`]

We can finish by setting both factors to zero and solving for x:

[`x + [$a] = 0`] and [`x + [$b] = 0`]

[`x = -[$a], -[$b]`]
