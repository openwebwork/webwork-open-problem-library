BEGIN_PGML

The figure below shows a satellite orbiting Earth. The satellite passes directly over two tracking stations [`A`] and [`B`], which are [`[$d]`] miles apart. When the satellite is on one side of the two stations, the angles of elevation at [`A`] and [`B`] are measured to be  [`83.9^\circ`] and [` 86.2^\circ`] respectively. How far is the satellite from station [`A`] and how high is the satellite above the ground? Round answers to the nearest whole mile.
