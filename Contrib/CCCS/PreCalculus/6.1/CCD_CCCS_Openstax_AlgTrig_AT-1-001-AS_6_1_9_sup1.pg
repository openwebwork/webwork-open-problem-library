BEGIN_PGML

For the following exercises, consider this scenario: 

For each year [`t`], the number of otters in Ocean [`A`] is represented by the function  [`A(t)=[$a]([$base1])^t`].  In Ocean [`B`] , the number of sea otters is represented by the function [`B(t)=[$b]([$base2])^t`].


1. Which oceans's sea otter population is declining at a faster rate?
[_________________]{$popup2} 

2. Which ocean had a greater number of sea otters initially?
[_________________]{$popup2} 

3. Initially, by how many sea otters did Ocean [`B`] exceed Ocean [`A`]?
[_________________]{$ans1}

4. Which ocean will have a lesser number of sea otters after [``[$e]``] years?
[_________________]{$popup2} 

5. After [``[$e]``] years, by how many sea otter inhabitants will Ocean [`A`] exceed Ocean [`B`]?  Round to the nearest whole number.
