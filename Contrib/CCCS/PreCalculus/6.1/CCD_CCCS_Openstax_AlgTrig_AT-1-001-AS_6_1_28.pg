BEGIN_PGML
An investment account, where interest is compounded monthly, is represented by the formula,
[``A(t) = [$p]\left(1+\frac{[$r]}{12}\right)^{12t}``], where [`t`] is measured in years after the initial investment.  

What is the principal value of the account?  In other words, what is [`A(0)`]?

[_________________]{$answer1} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("number") @]*

What is the interest rate for the account?  Enter the answer as a percentage, including the percent (%) symbol.

[_________________]{$answer2}[@ AnswerFormatHelp("number") @]*

How much money is in the account at time [`t = [$t]`]?

BEGIN_PGML

Suppose the initial investment of [`[$p]`] dollars is deposited into another account where interest is compounded continuously at the same rate of [`[$ContIntRate]`]%.   

How much money would be in this account at time [`t = [$t]`]?

[_________________]{$answer4} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("number") @]*

How much more interest would you receive in the account where interest is compounded continuously compared to the account where interest is compounded monthly? (Include 3 decimal places in your answer)
