BEGIN_PGML

For the following exercises, consider this scenario: 

For each year [`t`], the number of trees in Forest A is represented by the function  [`A(t)=[$a]([$base1])^t`].  In the nearby Forest B, the number of trees is represented by the function [`B(t)=[$b]([$base2])^t`].


1. Which forest's population is decreasing at a faster rate?
[_________________]{$popup2} 

2. Which forest had a greater number of trees initially?
[_________________]{$popup1} 

3. Initially, by how many trees did the larger forest exceed the smaller forest?
[_________________]{$ans1}

4. Which forest will have a greater number of trees after 30 years?
[_________________]{$popup1} 

5. After [$e] years, by how many trees will the larger forest exceed the smaller forest?  Round to the nearest whole number.
[_________________]{$ans2}
