BEGIN_PGML
A large mixing tank currently contains [$a] gallons of water, into which [$b] pounds of sugar have been mixed. A tap will open, pouring [$c] gallons of water per minute into the tank at the same time sugar is poured into the the tank as a rate of [$d] pounds per minute. Write the rational function that describes the concentration of sugar (given in pounds of sugar per gallon of water) in the tank after  [`t`]  minutes.
