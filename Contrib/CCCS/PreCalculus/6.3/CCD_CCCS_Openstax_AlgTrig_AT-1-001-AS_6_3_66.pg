#  Setup
$Magnitude1 = random(4, 6, 0.1);
$Magnitude2 = random(7, 9.5, 0.1);

$function = ("log(I_{1}/I_{2}) = M_{1} - M_{2}");

The intensity levels, [`I_{1}`] and [`I_{2}`], of two earthquakes measured on a seismograph can be compared by the formula `[$function]`, where [`M_{1}`] and [`M_{2}`] are the magnitudes of the two respective earthquakes, given by the Richter Scale. In August 2009, an earthquake of magnitude `[$Magnitude1]` hit the town of Tortuga. In March 2013, that same region experienced another earthquake, this time with a magnitude of `[$Magnitude2]`. How many times greater was the intensity of the 2013 earthquake compared to the 2009 earthquake? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
