BEGIN_TEXT
Dan is filling a swimming pool with water at a constant rate.$BR
 The table below shows the depth of the water over time.
$BR
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ begintable(7) \}
\{ row( "$SPACE $BBOLD Time Filling (hours) $EBOLD $SPACE", @row_one ) \}
\{ row( "$SPACE  $BBOLD Depth of Water (feet) $EBOLD $SPACE" , @row_two ) \}

\{$radio->print_a()\}

END_TEXT
ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Notice that the water depth increases by \(.5\) each hour after
the first. $BR There is only one answer that has a rate of .5 foot per hour so we know the answer has to be to multiply .5 by 6 and add 1.
