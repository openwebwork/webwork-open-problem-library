BEGIN_TEXT
The number of bacteria in a refrigerated food product is given by
$BCENTER
\( N(T) = $a T^2 - $b T + $c \),
$ECENTER




 for  \($lower_limit < T < $upper_limit \). The variable
 \(T\) is the temperature of the food. 

$PAR
When the food is removed from the refrigerator, the temperature is given by 
\(T(t) = $d t + $e \) , where \(t\) is the time in hours.
END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Find the composite function \( N(T(t)) \):
$PAR
$BCENTER
\( N(T(t)) =\)  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$ECENTER

# Tell WeBWork how to test if answers are right.  These should come in the
