SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 


$BR

$BR
\(a^ba^c = a^{bc}\) is false, we multiply powers with equal base by
adding the exponents, not by multiplying them.


$BR
\(a^ba^c = a^{b+c}\) is true, this is the correct way to multiply powers with equal base.

$BR
\(a^{-b} = \frac{1}{a^b}\) is true, you can change the sign in an exponent and replace multiplication with division by that power.




$BR
\(a^{-b} = -a^b\) is false. (In fact, a power with a positive base is
never negative.)



$BR \(a^b = ab\), 
not at all, exponentiation is as different from
multiplication as multiplication is from addition.
