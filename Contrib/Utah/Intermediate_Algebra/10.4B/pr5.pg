At time \( t = 0 \), in seconds, a pair of sunglasses
is dropped from the Eiffel Tower in Paris.  At time \( t \),
its height in feet above the ground is given by:
$BR
$BR
\( h(t) = -16t^2 + $h \).
$BR
$BR
(a) Look at the function to determine the height
from which the sunglasses were dropped.  Include units
in your answer.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
\{ AnswerFormatHelp("units") \}
$BR
$BR
(b) When do the sunglasses hit the ground?  Include units
in your answer.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
\{ AnswerFormatHelp("units") \}
$BR$BR Hint: Think about how the x-intercept(s), y-intercept, and the vertex of the graph correspond to different parts of the scenario of this problem.
