BEGIN_TEXT
We want to build a pen for sheep and we have $a feet of fencing. We plan to build the pen next to the river so that we only need to include thee sides.  Let \(y\) be the length of the side opposite the river \(x\) be the lengths of the sides perpendicular to the river.   See the picture below. (Click on it to enlarge).  $BR$BR

$PAR \{ image("sheep_field_prob_1.gif") \} $PAR
  

a) Find an equation for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).$BR$BR

\(y\) =  \{ans_rule(40)\} $BR$BR

b) Find an equation for the area of the field in terms of \(x\) (\(y\) should not appear in this equation).$BR$BR

\(A\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}

$BR$BR
The equation you found in part b) can be thought of as a function.  The input is the length \(x\) and the output is the area.  Think about the graph of the function and use either the intercepts of vertex to answer the next question.$BR$BR

c) Find the value of x that produces the largest total area.$BR$BR
\{ans_rule(30) \} feet$BR$BR

d) Find the value of y that produces the largest total area.$BR$BR
\{ans_rule(30) \} feet$BR$BR

e) What is the maximum total area? $BR$BR
Area: \{ans_rule(30) \} square feet.
