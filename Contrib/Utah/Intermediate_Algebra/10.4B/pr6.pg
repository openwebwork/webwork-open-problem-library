A ball is thrown up on the surface of a moon.  Its height
above the lunar surface (in feet) after \(t\) seconds is given by the formula$BR$BR
\[h=$ac t-\frac{$c}{$b}t^2.\]$BR

a. For practice, graph your function.  (Hint: Try finding the x-intercepts. Graph these.  Then find the x-coordinate of the vertex.  Substitute this in to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.   You can use a calculator to help with these computations, but do not use a graphing calculator.)


$BR$BR
b. Where on the graph can you find the information about the maximum height? 
 $BR \{ $popup1->menu() \}  

$BR$BR
c. Find the time that the ball reaches its maximum height.$BR
$BR time: \{ans_rule(20)\} seconds $BR
$BR$BR
d.Find the maximal height attained by the ball $BR
$BR height:  \{ans_rule(20)\} feet
