#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A rectangular lawn has a length that is $n yards greater
than the width.  The area of the lawn is $A square yards.
$BR
Note:  The formula for the area of a rectangle is $BITALIC
Area = length \(\times\) width $EITALIC.
$PAR
a) Write the polynomial equation for the area of the
lawn.  Use the variable \(x\) to represent the width
of the lawn.$BR$BR

Answer:  \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
b)  Solve the equation and give the width of the lawn.  $BR$BR
NOTE: State the units in your answer.$BR 
$BR
Width:  \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
END_TEXT

#  Answer

$ans_a = "x*(x+$n)=$A";
ANS(Picky_equation_cmp($ans_a));

$ans_b = $w;
