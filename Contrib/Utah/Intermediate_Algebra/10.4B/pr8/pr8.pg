BEGIN_TEXT

A rancher has \($a\) feet of fencing to enclose a field and run a fence down the middle of the corral dividing it into two parts.  There are three sides of fence with length \(x\) and two sides with length \(y\).  See the picture below. (Click on it to enlarge).  $BR$BR

$PAR \{ image("quadratic_field_prob.gif") \} $PAR
  

a) Find an equation for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).$BR$BR

\(y\) =  \{ans_rule(40)\} $BR$BR

b) Find an equation for the area of the field in terms of \(x\) (\(y\) should not appear in this equation).$BR$BR

\(A\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}

$BR$BR
The equation you found in part b) can be thought of as a function.  The input is the length \(x\) and the output is the area.  Think about the graph of the function and use either the intercepts of vertex to answer the next question.$BR$BR

c) Find the value of x that produces the largest total area.$BR$BR
\{ans_rule(30) \} feet$BR$BR

d) Find the value of y that produces the largest total area.$BR$BR
\{ans_rule(30) \} feet$BR$BR

e) What is the maximum total area? $BR$BR
Area: \{ans_rule(30) \} square feet.
