\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/powers/",
"Powers")\} and
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/radicals/",
"radicals")\} provide a beautiful illustration of how mathematics
starts from simple beginnings and then expands in a consistent manner
until it reaches results and concepts (like anything non=zero to the
power zero equals one) that aren't obvious and may seem strange at
first.


$BR

If \(32^x=\frac{1}{8}\), then \(x=\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-3/5));




SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD \(\pi\)
We know that \(32=2^5\) and hence \(2=32^{\frac{1}{5}}\). We also know 
that \(8 = 2^3\).  Hence \(8=32^{\frac{3}{5}}\)
and \(\frac{1}{8} = 32^{-\frac{3}{5}}.\)
$BR
 So \(x=-\frac{3}{5}.\).
