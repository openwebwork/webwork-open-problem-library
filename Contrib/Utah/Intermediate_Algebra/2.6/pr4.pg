#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
According to one mathematical model, the average life expectancy for American
men born in 1900 was 55 years. Life expectancy has increased by about 0.2 years
for each birth year after 1900. 
$PAR
a) Write a function \(m(t)\) that models the average life expectancy of a man born \(t\) years after 1900. 
$BR
Answer: \(m(t)=\) \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b)  According to your model, men born in what year will have average life expectancy of $n years? (Note: You are asked for a year, not a value for \(t\).) 
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(20) \}
