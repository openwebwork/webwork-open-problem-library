BEGIN_TEXT
Julia's phone plan has a base rate of ${DOLLAR}24.00 per month which includes unlimited talk and texting. She pays for ${DOLLAR}0.04 for each megabyte of data she uses.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The additional cost for using \(m\) megabytes of data is \( .04m \).
$BR  This means the total cost of her phone plan is \(24.00+0.04m  \)
