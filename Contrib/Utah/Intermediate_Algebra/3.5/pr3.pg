TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
There are currently $a frogs in a (large) pond.  The frog population grows exponentially,
tripling every $d days.
$BR
How long will it take (in days) for there to be $b frogs in the pond?
$BR
Time to $b frogs: \{ ans_rule(20) \} days
$BR
The pond's ecosystem can support $c frogs.  How long until the situation becomes critical?
$BR
Time to $c frogs: \{ ans_rule(20) \} days
