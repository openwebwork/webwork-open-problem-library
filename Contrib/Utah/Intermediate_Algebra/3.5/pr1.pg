Answer the following questions regarding the populations of the six towns above.  Whenever you need to enter several towns in one answer, enter your answer as a comma separated list of numbers.  For example if town $BITALIC 1${EITALIC}, town $BITALIC 2${EITALIC}, town $BITALIC 3${EITALIC}, and town $BITALIC 4${EITALIC}, are all growing you  could enter $BBOLD 1, 2, 3, 4 $EBOLD; or $BBOLD 2, 4, 1, 3 $EBOLD; or any other order of these four numerals separated by commas.

(a) Which of the towns are growing?  \{ ans_rule(20) \}

(b) Which of the towns are shrinking?  \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR

The formula \( f(t) = ab^t \) represents exponential growth if the base \( b > 1 \) and exponential decay if \( 0 < b < 1 \). Towns $q_grow are growing and towns $q_decay are shrinking.
$PAR
In the exponential function \( f(t) = ab^t \), the parameter \(a\) gives the value of the function when \(t = 0\).  We see that town $large_pop has the largest initial population ($a[2]) and town $small_pop has the smallest initial population ($a[1]).
