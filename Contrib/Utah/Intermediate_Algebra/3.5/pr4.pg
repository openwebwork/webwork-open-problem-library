BEGIN_TEXT
The cost of a parking ticket is $DOLLAR$a for the first offense, but the cost $cost[$tag] for each additional offense.  Write a formula for the cost \( C(n) \) as a function of the number of tickets \( n \).

Remember to use the variable "\( n \)" in your answer.
$PAR
\(\ C(n) \) = \{ans_rule(20) \}
