TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 








Line \(L\) is defined by \[y=\frac{1}{2}x+1.\]
The slope of \(L\) is
$BR 
$BR
\(y = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}. 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
A line that's perpendicular to \(L\) has the slope
 \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-2));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
The slopes of two lines are negative reciprocals of each other.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The original line has a slope of \(\frac{1}{2}\),
and a line that's perpendicular has a slope of \(-2\).
