SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
$BR
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}$nevr1 x+$mult y&=&5\\ $nevr1 x+$mult y &=& 6\\ \end{array} \)
has no solution, since the left hand sides of the system are equal, but the right hand sides are not.  5 does not equal 6. 
$BR 
$BR
\(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&5\\ $uni1 x+$uni2 y &=& 6\\ \end{array}\)
has a unique solution. 
$BR
$BR
 \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&5\\ $infi1 x+$infi2 y &=& $infi3\\ \end{array}\)
has infinitely many solutions.  The second equation can be obtained
from the first by multiplying with \($mult_factor\) and so it is redundant.
Solving the first equation for \(y\) gives 
\(y=-\frac{2}{3}x+\frac{5}{3}\).  The infinitely many solutions of the
system are the coordinates of the points on the line described by that equation.
