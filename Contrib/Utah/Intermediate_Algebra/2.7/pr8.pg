twice their difference.  The smaller integer is

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Calling the two numbers \(x\) and \(y\) we get the two equations
\(x+y= 48\) and \(x+y=2(x-y)\).  Subtracting \(2(x-y)\) on both sides of the second equation gives the linear equation
\(-x+3y=0\)
Therefore we have to solve the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
x&+y&=&48\\
-x&+3y&=&0\\
\end{array}
\]

Its solution is \(x=36\) and \(y=12\).
