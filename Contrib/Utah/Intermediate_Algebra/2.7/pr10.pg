#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
One day, a deli sold a total of $numTotal hamburgers and hot dogs.
The revenue from these sales was $showMoneyTotal.  The hamburgers were
$showBurgerPrice each and the hot dogs cost $showHotdogPrice 
each.
$PAR
a) Write an equation that describes the total number of hot dogs and burgers being sold in terms of \( x \) and \( y \). 
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$PAR
b) Write an equation that relates the total revenue from that day to \( x \), the number of burgers sold, and \( y \), the number of hot dogs sold.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$PAR
c) How many $items[$choose] did the store sell that day? (Include the word $items[$choose] in your answer).
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(15) \}

#  Answer

$ans_a = "x + y = $numTotal";
$ans_b = "$burgerPrice * x + $hotdogPrice * y = $moneyTotal";
$ans_c = $Answers[$choose];

ANS(equation_cmp($ans_b,vars=>['x','y']));
ANS(num_and_unit_checker($ans_c,$items[$choose]));
