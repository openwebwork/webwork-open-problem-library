BEGIN_TEXT
You are given a scenario which can be modeled by a quadratic function. Each part of the scenario corresponds to a different part of the graph of the quadratic function.  Choose the part of the graph that gives information about the specified part of the scenario.   $BR$BR

SCENARIO: The height of a baseball \(t\) seconds after being hit is modeled by:$BR$BR
 \[ h(t)=-16t^2+75t+3.5\]$BR

Parts of the scenario:$BR $BR 

A) The height of the ball when it is hit.  \{ $popup1->menu() \}   $BR $BR 
B) The time when the ball hits the ground.  \{ $popup2->menu() \}   $BR $BR  
C) A part of the graph unrelated to the scenario.  \{ $popup3->menu() \}  $BR$BR 
D) The maximum height of the ball.  \{ $popup4->menu() \}  $BR $BR 
E) The time when the ball is at its highest.  \{ $popup5->menu() \}
