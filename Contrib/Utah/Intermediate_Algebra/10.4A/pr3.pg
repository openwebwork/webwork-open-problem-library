Suppose that the height \( s \) of a ball (in feet) at time \( t \) (in seconds) is
given by the formula \( s(t) = - 16(t - 1)^2 +64\).  This function is graphed below on the interval
\( 0 \leq t \leq 3 \).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The ball is released at time \(t=0\), which corresponds to the 
vertical intercept of the graph at point A, so the ball is released from
a height of \(s(0)=48\) meters. The highest point of the graph is C, which
corresponds to the ball's highest point, and occurs when \(t=1\). The ball hitting the 
ground corresponds to the horizontal intercept at point G, which 
happens when \(t=3\).
