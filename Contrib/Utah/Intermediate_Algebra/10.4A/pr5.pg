BEGIN_TEXT
You are given a scenario which can be modeled by a quadratic function. Each part of the scenario corresponds to a different part of the graph of the quadratic function.  Choose the part of the graph that gives information about the specified part of the scenario.   $BR$BR

SCENARIO: A publishing house has printed 10,000 copies of a book and is deciding what price they should sell the book at. If the price is low, they sell many copies, but make little or no profit on them.  If the price is high, the profit on each book is substantial, but the do not sell many copies.  The following model describes the profit which the publishing house earns if the price of the book is given by \(x\) dollars. $BR$BR
 \[ f(x)=-60x^2-1740x-940\]$BR

Parts of the scenario:$BR $BR 

A) The price which maximizes the profit.  \{ $popup1->menu() \}   $BR $BR 
B) The amount they lose if they give the book away for free.  \{ $popup2->menu() \}   $BR $BR  
C) The largest possible profit.  \{ $popup3->menu() \}  $BR$BR 
D) The price at which the publisher goes from losing to making money. \{ $popup4->menu() \}  $BR $BR 
E) The price at which the publisher goes from making to losing money. \{ $popup5->menu() \}
