#  Setup

Context(Currency);

$price = random(30000,33000,100);
$displayPrice = Currency($price);

$d = random(2000,2700,10);
$depreciation = Currency($d);

$answer = random(5,11,1);
$b = $price - $d*($answer);
$value = Currency($b);

#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
In 2003, the price of a certain automobile was approximately 
$displayPrice with a depreciation of $depreciation per year.
$PAR
a) Write a function \(f(t)\) which models the value of the car \(t\) years  after 2003.  Write the function in slope-intercept form.
$BR
Answer: \(f(t)=\) \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b)   After how many
years will the car's value be $value?  Solve the equation to answer the question above. (Note: Include the units, in this case $BITALIC years.$EITALIC)
$BR
Answer: \(t=\) \{ans_rule(20) \}

#  Note:  This should been to be changed whenever an Equation
#         MathObject is written or a better equation checker is written.
