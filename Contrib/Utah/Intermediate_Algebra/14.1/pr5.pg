Suppose a mining company will supply \($x1\) tons of 
ore per month if the price is \($y1\) dollars per ton 
but will supply \($x2\) tons per month if the price is \($y2\) dollars per ton.  Assume the supply function is of the form 
\( f(x)= mx+b \), where \(x\) is the number of tons of ore supplied in one month, and \(f(x)\) is the price in dollars per ton. Find the slope, 
\(m\) and \(y\)-coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept, \(b\) $BR
