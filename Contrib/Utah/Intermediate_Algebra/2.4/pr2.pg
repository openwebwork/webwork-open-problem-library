Write the following equation in $BBOLD slope-intercept $EBOLD form to help you answer the following questions.

\[ $a x - $b y + $c = 0 \]

$PAR
a) What is the slope of the line? 
$BR
\( m = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) What is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line?$BR
\( b = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR

Writing an equation in slope intercept form means solving for y. 
\[ $a x - $b y + $c = 0 \]
gives
\[ - $b y = - $a x - $c\]
so that
\[ y = $md x + $kd \]

From the slope intercept form we can easily identify the slope as \( $md \) and the y-intercept as \( $kd \).
