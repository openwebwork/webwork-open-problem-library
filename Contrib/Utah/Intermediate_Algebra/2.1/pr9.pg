$PAR
The graph below illustrates your north-south distance in miles from
the edge of a lake in hours from noon (where positive values mean
you are north of the lake). When the graph passes through the axis,
it means you pass by the edge of the lake (so your distance is 0).
Complete the following description of your journey, selecting the
correct descriptions of directions and filling in the numerical values
for the indicated distances and speeds.

"At noon I am a distance of \{ ans_rule(5) \} miles from the lake
relaxing. I then jump on my bike and start to cycle 
\{ $dirOne->menu() \} the lake at a speed of \{ ans_rule(5) \} mph.
At 3pm I stop for a rest and a picnic for three hours.
I then jump back on my bike and cycle \{ $dirTwo->menu() \} the lake
at a speed of \{ ans_rule(5) \} mph. At 8pm I arrive at my house
which is a distance of \{ ans_rule(5) \} miles from the lake."

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Since the graph measures the distance between you and the lake, your
initial distance is the absolute value of the vertical intercept, so
\($b1\) miles. Initially, because the graph is moving
\{ $dirOne->correct_ans() \} the
x-axis, you are cycling \{ $dirOne->correct_ans() \} the lake.
The speed you are travelling
is equal to the absolute value of the slope of the distance graph,
so \($a1 \) mph. After the picnic, since the graph is moving
\{ $dirTwo->correct_ans() \}
the x-axis, you are cycling \{ $dirTwo->correct_ans() \} the lake at
a speed of
\($c1\) mph (the absolute value of the slope). You arrive at your
house at 8pm, so the distance of your house to the lake will be the
absolute value of the distance function at that time, so \($d\) miles.
