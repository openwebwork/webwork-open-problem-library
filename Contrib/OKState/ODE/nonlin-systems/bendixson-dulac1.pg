$BR
$BR
Consider the following systems \(x' = f(x,y), y' = g(x,y) \).
Compute the expression in the (simpler) Bendixson-Dulac theorem
(\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \)) and 
decide if the theorem applies or not (if it applies, then the system
has no closed trajectory).  The region you take
is the largest region in which both \(f\) and \(g\) are defined.
