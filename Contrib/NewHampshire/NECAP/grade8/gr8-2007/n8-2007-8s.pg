Four people have dinner together at a restaurant.  They pay equal portions of the cost,$BR in dollars, of the dinner, \(d\), and the $DOLLAR 10 tip.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The total cost is the price of the dinner plus the tip, which is \(d+10\).
$BR
Splitting this into four equal parts makes each part \((d+10)\div 4\).$BR
When an expression is not parenthesized, multiplication and division are done$BR
before addition and subtraction so  \(d+10\div 4= d+\frac{10}{4}\).
