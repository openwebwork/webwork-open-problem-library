BEGIN_TEXT
The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a regular polygon is \(540^\circ\).  $PAR
That means that the polygon must have \{ans_rule(3)\} sides.

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(5)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
It is not necessary to memorize a formula to do this problem.  Just notice that
if we$BR draw lines from any vertex of such a polygon to all non-adjacent vertices we have split the$BR
polygon into triangles.  Since the sum of the measures of the interior angles
of a triangle is \(180^\circ\) $BR if the polygon has sum \(540^\circ\), it
is split into 3 triangles by this procedure $BR so it must be a pentagon (5 sided).
