When a knight sets out on a quest he must choose a road to follow.$PAR
3 out of every 5 knights takes the High Road.  The others take the Low Road.$PAR
Of the knights taking the High Road 80% are successful in their quest. The others fail.$PAR
Of the knights taking the Low Road 40% are successful in their quest. The others fail.$PAR
a) A knight is chosen at random.  The probability that he will take the Low Road is \{ans_rule(3)\}.$PAR
b) A knight is chosen at random.  The probability that he will take the High road and succeed in his quest is \{ans_rule(3)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) If 3 out of every 5 knights take the High Road then 40% take the Low Road so
the probability is 0.4.$PAR
b) 60% of the knights take the High Road.  Of these 80% succeed so the probability is \(0.6\times 0.8=.48\).$PAR
ON THE EXAMINATION, IT WAS REQUIRED THAT THE WORK IN OBTAINING YOUR ANSWER
BE SHOWN $BR  AN EXPLANATION SIMILAR TO THAT ABOVE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR FULL CREDIT.
