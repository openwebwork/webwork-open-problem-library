BEGIN_TEXT
Triangle ABC has a base of 5 inches and a height of 4 inches.$BR
Triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF.  Triangle DEF has dimensions$BR
that are 3 times as great as those of triangle ABC.  The area of triangle$BR
DEF is \{ans_rule(3)\} times as great as the area of triangle ABC.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The base of triangle DEF is 3 times as great as the base of triangle ABC.$BR
The altitude of triangle DEF is 3 times as great as the altitude of triangle ABC.$BR
The area of a triangle is half the base times the altitude so triange $BR
DEF is 9 times the area of triangle ABC.
$PAR
ON THE EXAMINATION, IT WAS REQUIRED THAT THE WORK IN OBTAINING YOUR ANSWER
BE SHOWN $BR  AN EXPLANATION SIMILAR TO THAT ABOVE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR FULL CREDIT.
