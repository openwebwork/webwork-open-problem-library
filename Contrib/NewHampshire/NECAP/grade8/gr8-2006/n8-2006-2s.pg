BEGIN_TEXT
IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR.
THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
Katie makes a necklace using the pattern of 2 red beads followed by 3 blue beads.$BR She uses a total of 75 beads for the necklace.
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}


END_TEXT
ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Since the pattern uses 2 red beads and 3 blue beads, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the
beads $BR must be red (whenever the number of beads is a multiple of 5). $BR
 So the number of red beads is \(\frac{2}{5} \times 75=30\).
