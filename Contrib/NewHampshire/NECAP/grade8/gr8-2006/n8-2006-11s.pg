BEGIN_TEXT
The ramp shown below is a triangular prism.
$BR

\{ image( insertGraph($graph), tex_size=>100,
    height=>300, width=>450
    ) \}

$PAR
The volume of this ramp is \{ans_rule(2)\} cubic feet
END_TEXT
ANS(Real(240)->cmp );
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The base is a right triangle of area \(\frac{5\times 12}{2}=30\) square feet $BR and the altitude is 8 feet so the volume is \(30\times 8=240\) cubic feet.$PAR
When this problem was given on the examination there was a crucial omission in $BR the diagram. The right angle idicator for the rectangle was missing.  A very
observant $BR student could point out that without that indicator, it would be
completely certain that $BR the quadrilateral actually is a rectangle and if it
is not then the altitude is not 8 feet$BR since it is the length of the side
of the quadrilateral.  Thus it would not be clear$BR what the volume is. $PAR
What should the student do when she recognizes this error.  This is a difficult
decision.  $BR I would suggest that the student tell the person who is proctoring the exam of the problem $BR and then give the answer that the problem writer expected (I am almost certain that the$BR quadrilateral was meant to be a rectangle).
