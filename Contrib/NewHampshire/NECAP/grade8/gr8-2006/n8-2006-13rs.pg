IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR.$BR
THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
Larry buys a sweater that has a regular price of $DOLLAR $p. $BR
The sweater is on sale for 30% off.  The sale price of the sweater is
$Dollar \{ans_rule(3)\}

END_TEXT
ANS(Real($ans)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The discount is 30% of $DOLLAR $p which is $DOLLAR $disc. $BR Thus, the sale 
price is $DOLLAR $p - $DOLLAR $disc = $DOLLAR $ans.$PAR
ON THE EXAMINATION, IT WAS REQUIRED THAT THE WORK IN OBTAINING YOUR ANSWER
BE SHOWN $BR  AN EXPLANATION SIMILAR TO THAT ABOVE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR FULL CREDIT.
