BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The best way to handle this problem, if the answer is not immediately clear to you,$BR is to add a positive quantity to \(n\) and see what happens to \(p\).  $BR
Suppose \(m\) is positive and we repace \(n\) by \(n+m\). Calling the resulting
value$BR of \(p\) by the name \(p'\) we obtain the equation$PAR
\(p'=2(n+m)-10=2n-10+2m\).  $PAR
This tells us that when we increase \(n\) by \(m\) we increase \(p\) by \(2m\).
