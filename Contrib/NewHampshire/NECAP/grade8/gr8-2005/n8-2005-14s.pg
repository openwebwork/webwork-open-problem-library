Look at this pattern.$PAR
0, 2, 6, 12, 20,...$PAR
The next two terms in this pattern are \{ans_rule(3)\} followed by \{ans_rule(3)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The pattern intended is undoubtedly increasing difference by multiples of 2, $BR
that is 0+2=2,+4=6,+6=12,+8=20,+10=30,+12=42.$PAR
It is certainly true that there are other patterns that start in this way and $BR
a very clever student can find such.  However, if you don't use the pattern that
the $BR examiners anticipate, you will be graded wrong.  Unfair? maybe. Realistic? yes.

$PAR
THIS QUESTION HAD A SECOND PART ON THE NEAP EXAMINATION.$BR 
 "Use words or symbols to describe the pattern." $BR
GIVING THE INTENDED ANSWER WOULD GIVE YOU CREDIT.  BEING CLEVER AND AVOIDING IT WOULD NOT.
