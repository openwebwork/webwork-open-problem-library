BEGIN_TEXT
Ken wants to earn $tot to buy a computer game.  He uses the equation below to$BR the number of hours, \(h\), he needs to babysit to earn the  $tot.$PAR
\(5h+$b=$totx\).$PAR
Ken needs to babysit for \{ans_rule(3)\} hours to earn enough money to buy the
computer game.

ANS(Real($h)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR  Solution  $PAR
What remains is to just solve the equation.  Subtracting $b from each side we get$PAR \(5h=$h5\)  $BR
   so \(h=$h\);
