$PAR Solution $PAR
The perimeter is the length of the boundary, so it would be in units of feet.$BR
Starting in the lower left and going clockwise the perimeter is the sum of lines
of length$BR \(6+2+3+2+3+4=20\ \)feet.$PAR
An easy  way to find the area is to think of the garden as consisting of a
2 foot by 3 foot $BR (= 6 square foot) rectangle at the top of the diagram and a
4 foot by 3 foot (= 12 square foot) rectangle$BR at the bottom.  This gives an
area of 18 square feet.

The question on the NECAP examination had a third part: $BR What is the perimeter of a rectangle that has the same area as the garden?$BR  There are many correct answers, including $BR
18 for a rectangle with dimensions 6 feet and 3 feet.$BR
22 for a rectangle with dimensions 9 feet and 2 feet.$BR
\(4 \sqrt{18}=12 \sqrt{2}\) for a square of side \(\sqrt {18}\).$BR
Since there were actually infinitely many correct answers, we could not check all $BR possible answers in WeBWorK and so we did not include the question.
