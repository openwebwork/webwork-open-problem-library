BEGIN_TEXT
The students at Maple Grove School are selling flowers.  Their goal is to sell 1500 flowers$PAR
On the first day, the students sold 547 flowers.$PAR
On the second day, the students sold 655 flowers$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
There are two ways to attack this problem.$PAR  One way is to add up the number of flowers sold in the first two days and subtract$BR that from 1500. $BR
 \(547+655=1202\)$BR \(1500-1202=298\).$PAR
A second way is to subtract the number sold the first day from the goal and then subtract$BR the number sold the first day from the first result.$BR
 \(1500-547=953\)$BR \(953-655=298\).$PAR
Most people would prefer the first method because they find addition easier than subtraction.
