BEGIN_TEXT
For a science project, Ms. Mullins put her class into 6 groups with 4 students
in $BR each group and no students left over.  In a mathematics project, Ms Mullins will $BR put her class into groups with 2 students in each group and no students left over.$PAR

ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Since the mathematics groups are half the size of the science groups she will
have $BR
twice as many mathematics groups as science groups.  Thus she will have 12 science groups.
