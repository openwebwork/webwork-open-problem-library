BEGIN_TEXT
IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NECAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT$BR A CALCULATOR. 
 THIS IS A NECAP PROBLEM FOR WHICH A  CALCULATOR $BR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
Look at this statement:$PAR
Any transformation of the triangle LMN on a coordinate grid results in a congruent image.$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Reflections, rotations and translations preserve angles and lengths.$BR
A dilation by scale factor 2 doubles length and so does not preserve congruence.
