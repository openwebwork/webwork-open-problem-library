BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
It seems that the NECAP folks think that using the word dice will corrupt 11-th graders.$PAR
For the product to be an odd number, both dice will have to show odd numbers.$BR
Think of having a red die and a green die.$BR  We will list the cases by ordered pairs listing
the number on the green die first$PAR
(1,1), (1,3),(1,5),(3,1),(3,3),(3,5), (5,1), (5,3)$BR
(another way of thinking of this is that the only pair of odds we can exclude is (5,5).)
$PAR
  
Thus our probaility is \(\frac{8}{36}=\frac{2}{9}\).
