IF YOU ARE PREPARING FOR A NECAP EXAMINATION, DO NOT USE A CALCULATOR ON THIS
PROBLEM $BR SINCE CALCULATORS WERE NOT PERMITTED ON THIS PROBLEM IN THE NECAP EXAM.$PAR
Harold is planning a party for 32 people.  He has some round tables and some $BR
square tables.$PAR
There are 6 chairs at each round table$PAR
There are 4 chairs at each square table.$PAR
The fewest number of tables Harold needs for 32 people with no chairs left over is 
\{ans_rule(1)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The idea is to use as many round tables as possible and then just enough square $BR square tables to seat the rest of 32 people without any empty chairs.  $BR
The largest multiple of 6 less than 32 is 30 but if we cannot add a full table if $BR we use 5 tables because only two people are left over.  The next possibility is 4 round$BR table which hold 24 people.  Then we can add square tables for the other eight people. $BR Thus our answer is 6.$PAR
ON THE NECAP EXAM YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SHOW YOUR WORK OR EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING $BR  AN EXPLANATION SIMILAR TO THAT ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
