BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
A rhombus is a parallelogram with 4 congruent sides.$BR  A rectangle is a parallellogram with 4 right angles. $BR A rhombus does not have to be a rectangle. $BR The only kind of rectangle that is also a rhombus is a square.$BR  So the only thing that
a rectangle and rhombus have in common is that they are both parallelograms.$BR
Thus the answer is that they have 2 pairs of parallel sides.
