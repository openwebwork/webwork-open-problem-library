BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR  SOLUTION  $PAR
A parallelogram with four angles of measure \(90^\circ\) is a rectangle so thatis possible.$BR
The angles of a rhombus must add up to \(360^\circ\).  But an acute angle has
measure less than \(90^\circ\) so four of them cannot add up to \(360^\circ\).$BR

A rhombus has sides of equal lengths so it cannot have sides that measure 4 cm, 4 cm, 8cm, 8cm.$BR

Opposite sides of a parallelogram must have equal length, so a parallelogram cannot have sides that measure 2 cm, 4cm, 6 cm, 8 cm.
