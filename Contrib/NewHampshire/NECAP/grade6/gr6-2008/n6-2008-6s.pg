BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR  SOLUTION  $PAR
There are four flowers and the fourth stencilled is a lily.  That means that
the eight will also be a lily and so will the flower $BR with number that is
each multiple of four.  28 is the largest multiple of four that is less than
or equal to 30 $BR so the twenty eighth flower stencilled is a lily.  The
twenty ninth must hen be a tulip and the thirtieth must be a daisy.
