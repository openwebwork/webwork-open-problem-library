IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NECAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT$BR A CALCULATOR 
 THIS IS A NECAP PROBLEM FOR WHICH A  CALCULATOR $BR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR 
The 24 students of Mr. Allen's class voten on which flavor of ice cream they liked best $BR The circle graph below compares the number of votes each flavor received. 

$BR

\{ image( insertGraph($graph), tex_size=>$TEXSIZE,
    height=>$HEIGHT, width=>$WIDTH
    ) \}

$PAR
\{ans_rule(1 )\} students voted for Chocolate.$PAR
\{ans_rule(1 )\} students voted for Vanilla.$PAR
\{ans_rule(1 )\} students voted for Strawberry.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
There are 24 students in the class.  The circle graph showed that half of the
students$BR voted for chocolate so half of the 24 voters (that is, 12 students)
voted for chocolate.$BR  Similarly, one quarter of the voters (that is, 6 students) voted for each of vanilla and strawberry.$PAR
IN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NECAP EXAM YOU WERE EXPECTED $BR
 TO SHOW YOUR WORK.  SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION $BR
 ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
