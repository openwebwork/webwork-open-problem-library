BEGIN_TEXT
Juan made cones and cylinders out of paper.$BR
He cut a total of 10 circles for bases.  Juan made 4 cones.

END_TEXT
ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Each cone requires 1 base, so after using 4 circles for the cones there were 6 circles left.$BR
Each cylinder requires 2 bases, so 6 circles are enough for 3 cylinders.
