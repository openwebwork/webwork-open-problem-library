$PAR Solution $PAR
The four triangles fit on the four sides of the square to form a pyramid.$BR
To see that it can't be a cube, notice that a cube has no triangular faces (and has 6 faces)$BR
To see that it can't be a cone, notice that a cone has a circular face.$BR
To see that it can't be a prism notice that a prism has a pair of congruent bases plus $BR
sides that are parallelograms.
