Michelle states that 90 students were supporting the home team.$BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
From the graph, it appears that approximately \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the students$BR
 supported the home team.  If that estimate is correct then the answer would $BR
be \(\frac{3}{2}\times 90=135\).$PAR  Now we will look at the other answers to see$BR if they are reasonable.$PAR
\(120=\frac{4}{3}\times 90\) so if there were 120 students \(\frac{3}{4}\) would
be$BR supporting the home team. But we can see that \(\frac{1}{4}\) support the$BR
 visitors. But there are some students who are not sure so 120 can't be correct.
$PAR \(150=\frac{5}{3}\times 90\).  So if there were 150 students, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of them$BR would be supporting the home team.  Now \(\frac{3}{5} <\frac{5}{8}\) and so if \(\frac{3}{5}\) of$BR the students supported the home team, there would be more than half as many that$BR were not sure 
as the number who supported and a careful look at the graph shows$BR that this is not true.$PAR
180 is certainly wrong because that would mean that only half of the students supported $BR the  home team and the graph shows that is not true.
