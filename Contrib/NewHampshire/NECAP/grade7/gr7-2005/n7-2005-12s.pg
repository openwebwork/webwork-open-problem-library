BEGIN_TEXT
The manager of a restaurant uses the formula below to decide what to charge for a meal.$PAR
\(p=(f\div 3)\times 10\)$PAR
In the formula, \(p\) is the price, in dollars. that customers pay for a mean and$BR
\(f\) is the food cost to make the meal.$PAR
If the food cost is $DOLLAR 4.50 then the price of the meal is $\{ans_rule(3)\}

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(15)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Just substitute 4.50 for \(f\) to get the equation \(p=(4.50\div 3)\times 10\).
$BR Now this gives us p = 15.
