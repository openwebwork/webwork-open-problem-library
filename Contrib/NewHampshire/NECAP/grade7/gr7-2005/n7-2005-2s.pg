Angie has $DOLLAR5.00 to buy as many peaches as possible.  She knows that the price$BR of peaches is $DOLLAR0.89 or $DOLLAR0.99 per pound.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
If peaches cost $DOLLAR0.99 per pound, Angie can buy just over 5 pounds,$BR
If peaches cost $DOLLAR0.89 per pound, Angie can buy less than 6 pounds (since $BR \(6\times 0.89=5.34\)). Therefore Angie can buy between 5 and 6 pounds.
