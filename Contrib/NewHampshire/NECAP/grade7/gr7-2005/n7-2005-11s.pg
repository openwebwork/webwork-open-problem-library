The ratio of triangles to squares is \{ans_rule(1)\}  :  \{ans_rule(3)\}.

The values in your answers should have greatest common divisor l.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The question as given in the NECAP examination was: $BR 
"What is the ratio of oranges to apples?".  Since it is$BR 
hard to make oranges and apples with our graphics program $BR
we used triangles and squares.  Since NECAP did not supply $BR
answers, we used the usual x : y form for a ratio.  To set up $BR
the problem so that there was just one choice of answer, we $BR
added the condition that the values should have common denominator 1.$BR
It is not clear exactly what answers NECAP considered correct for the $BR
problem as they stated it, but with 4 triangles and 6 squares the ratio $BR
would have to be a pair with where the second entry was \(\frac{3}{2}\) times the first.
