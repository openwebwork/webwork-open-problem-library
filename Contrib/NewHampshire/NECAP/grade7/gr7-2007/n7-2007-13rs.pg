IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR
THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR

The correct price of a CD at a store is $DOLLAR 8.99.  The CD's were incorrectly sold for $a1 each.$BR  100 CD's were sold at the incorrect price. $BR
The store lost \{ans_rule(4)\} altogether 

END_TEXT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The loss on each cd was $b1 so the total loss was \(100\times\) $b1=$b2.
