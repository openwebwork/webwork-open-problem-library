BEGIN_TEXT
IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NECAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR
 THIS IS A NECAP PROBLEM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
Five people applied for jobs at a store.  Only two of these people will be hired. $PAR The number of different pairs of people who could be hire is \{ans_rule(1)\}.

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(10)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
To do this problem without knowing any particular formulas you could work as follows.$BR
We could start by saying that there are 5 choices for the first person to be hired.$BR Then there are four people left so there would be four ways to choose a
second person.$BR
So the first thought might be to just multiply 5 by 4 to get 20.$BR
But you have to remember that any particular pair of people could be chosen in
$BR two different ways (for example John first and Mary second or Mary first and John second).$BR  Thus we must divide by 2 to get an answer of 10.
$PAR

IN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NECAP EXAM YOU WERE EXPECTED $BR
 TO SHOW YOUR WORK.  SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION $BR
 ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
