$PAR Solution $PAR
A pyramid has a base face with triangular faces on all of the sides, meeting
in a vertex above the base.$BR  A triangular pyramid has a base with three
sides plus three faces that meet at the vertex above the base$BR.  A rectangular pyramid has one more side in the base and thus one more face. $BR
A prism has two congruent bases with rectangular faces joining corresponding
sides.
