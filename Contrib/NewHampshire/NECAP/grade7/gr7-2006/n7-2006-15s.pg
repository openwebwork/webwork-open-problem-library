BEGIN_TEXT
IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR THIS IS A NEAP PROBLEM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR   
Look at this diagram. (comment- this seems a little silly since it is not 
much of a diagram).
$PAR

\{ image( insertGraph($graph), tex_size=>100,
    height=>400, width=>400
    ) \}

$PAR
Ms. Heron gave her son and grandchildren 12 acres of farmland.$PAR
She have her son half of the 12 acres. $PAR
She split the rest equally among the 3 grandchildren.$PAR
a) She gave each grandchild \{ans_rule(2)\} acres. $PAR
b) The fraction of the farm that she gave each grandchild  \{ans_rule(3)\}

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(2)->cmp );
Context("LimitedFraction");
ANS(Compute("1/6")->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) She gave her son half of the twelve acres (that is, 6 acres). This left
6 acres $BR for the 3 grandchildren.  So each got \(\frac {1}{3} \) of 6 acres,
which is 2 acres.
b) 2 acres is \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) of the farm.
$PAR
ON THE NEAP EXAMINATION, STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO SHOW THEIR WORK ON BOTH PARTS$BR OF THIS QUESTION.  SOMETHING LIKE THE SOLUTIONS ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
