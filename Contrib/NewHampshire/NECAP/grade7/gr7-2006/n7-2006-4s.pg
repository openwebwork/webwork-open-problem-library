BEGIN_TEXT
Jenn is making lemonade for a picnic.$PAR
Each lemon has about 5 fluid ounces of juice.$PAR
She needs \(1\frac{1}{2}\) cups of juice.$BR

\{$radio->print_a()\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Jenn needs 12 ounces of juice.  3 lemons would be about 15 ounces. $BR
That would almost certainly be enough.  If the lemons were large and each
had $BR 6 fluid ounces then 2 would be enough.
