BEGIN_TEXT
Travis has a photograph that is 4 inches wide and 6 inches tall.$PAR
a) Travis enlarges the photograph proportionally so that it is 16 inches wide.
So it must be \{ans_rule(1)\} inches tall.$PAR
b) Can Travis enlarge the photograph proportionally to 8 inches by 10 inches?$BR Answer y (for yes) or n (for no).  \{ans_rule(1)\}

END_TEXT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) If Travis multiplies the width by 4 to get a width of 16 inches, then to
enlarge $BR he must multiply the height by 4 to get a height of 24 inches.
$PAR
b) If the width is to be 8 inches, which is double 4 inches then the height would
have $BR to be 12 inches.  If the height were to be 8 inches, which is \(\frac{4}{3}\times 6\ inches\) then $BR the width would have to be \(\frac{4}{3}\times 4\ inches = 5\frac{1}{3}\ inches\).$BR So it is impossible to  enlarge the photograph proportionally to 8 inches by 10 inches.$PAR
ON THE NEAP EXAMINATION YOU WERE ASKED TO EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO b. $BR 
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION ABOVE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR FULL CREDIT.
