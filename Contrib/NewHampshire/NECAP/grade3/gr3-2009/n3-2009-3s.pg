BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
"Mrs. Linz give 10 more piano lessons than drum lessons." is the answer.$PAR
Since Mrs. Linz gives three drum lessons:$BR
"Mrs. Linz give 1 more piano lesson than drum lessons. " 
would mean that she  gives 4 piano lessons.$BR
"Mrs. Linz give 1 fewer piano lesson than drum lessons. " would mean that she  gives 2 piano lessons.$BR
"Mrs. Linz give 10 fewer piano lessons than drum lessons. " would mean that she
gives 3-10 = -7 piano lessons.
