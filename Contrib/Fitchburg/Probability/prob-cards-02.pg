BEGIN_PGML
Suppose that you have [$total] cards. [$num1] are [$color1] and [$num2] are
[$color2]. The cards are well shuffled. You randomly draw two cards,
*with replacement*.

* [`G_1`] = the event the first card drawn is [$color1]
* [`G_2`] = the event the second card drawn is [$color1]
* [`E`] = the event at least one card is [$color1].

a) [`P(G_1\text{ and }G_2)`] = [__]{$ans1}
b) [`P(E)`]                  = [__]{$ans2}
c) [`P(G_2|G_1)`]            = [__]{$ans3}
