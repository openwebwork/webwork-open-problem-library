A soft-serve ice cream shop sold [$total] ice creams in a day. The following
table identifies the ice creams they sold by flavor and whether they were
served in a cup or cone. Fill in the missing values.

a) What is the probability that a randomly selected ice cream was served in a cup? [____]{$cup/$total}
b) What is the probability that a randomly selected ice cream was either chocolate or swirl? [____]{($chocolate+$swirl)/$total}
c) What is the probability that a randomly selected ice cream was chocolate served in a cup? [____]{$cupchocolate/$total}
d) What is the probability that a randomly selected ice cream was strawberry, given that it was served in a cone? [____]{$conestrawberry/$cone}
e) What is the probability that a randomly selected ice cream was not chocolate? [____]{($total-$chocolate)/$total}
