BEGIN_PGML
Suppose that you have [$total] cards. [$num1] are [$color1] and [$num2] are
[$color2]. The [$color1] cards are numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., [$num1].
The [$color2] cards are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... [$num2]. The cards are
well shuffled. You randomly draw one card.

* [`G`] = the event the card drawn is [$color1]
* [`E`] = the event the card drawn is even-numbered

a) [`P(G)`]              = [__]{$ans1}
b) [`P(E)`]              = [__]{$ans2}
c) [`P(G\text{ and }E)`] = [__]{$ans3}
d) [`P(G\text{ or }E)`]  = [__]{$ans4}
e) [`P(G|E)`]            = [__]{$ans5}
f) [`P(E|G)`]            = [__]{$ans6}
