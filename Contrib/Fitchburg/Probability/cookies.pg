BEGIN_PGML
In a box of assorted cookies, [$cookies]% contain chocolate, [$nuts]%
contain nuts, and [$both]% contain both chocolate and nuts. [$p] is
allergic to both chocolate and nuts.

a) What is the probability that a cookie contains chocolate or nuts
  (they can't eat it)? [___________]{Percent($allergic)}
b) What is the probability that a cookie does not contain chocolate or nuts
  (they can eat it)? [___________]{Percent($safe)}
