[[$SOL]]

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information, start with the equation in slope-intercept form, that is, [` y = mx+b`].  Then substitute in any known information.  The desired line is parallel to the line [` [$linestr] = [$rhs]`], so first we need to write this in slope-intercept form to find the slope.  To do this, solve the equation for [`y`]. 

[`` [$linestr] = [$rhs] ``]

Subtract [` [$xterms] `] from both sides to get:

[`` [$yterms] = [$mxterms] + [$rhs] ``]

And then divide through by [$c] to get:

[`` y = [$g1] + [$yigiven] ``]

This is the equation of the given line in slope-intercept form.  Therefore the slope of this equation is [`m_1=[$slope]`] and the slope [` m_2`] of the desired line is found from 

[`` m_1  m_2 = -1 ``]
or
[`` m_2 = -\frac{1}{[$slope]} = [$islope] ``] 

We write the slope-intercept form with this slope as:

[`` y = [$g2] + b ``]
And use the point [` [$pt] `] to find [`b `].  

[`` 
\begin{eqnarray}
[@$b+1@]* & = &  ($islope)(\{$a+1\}) + b \\
[@$b+1@]* & = & $g3 + b 
\end{eqnarray} 
``] 

Next, subtract [` [$g3] `] from both sides:

[`` [$yi2] = b``]
 and finally plug this value of b into the equation:

[`` y = [$g2] + [$yi2] ``]
