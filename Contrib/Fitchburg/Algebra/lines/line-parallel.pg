BEGIN_PGML

Find an equation of the line that is parallel to  [`[$line1] = [$rhs] `],
and passes through the point [` [$pt] `].
Write your answer in slope-intercept form.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information,
start with the equation in slope-intercept form, that is, [` y = mx+b`].
Then substitute in any known information.  The desired line is parallel
to the line [` [$line1] = [$rhs]`], so first we need to write this in
slope-intercept form to find the slope.  To do this, solve the equation
for [`y`].

[``` [$line1] = [$rhs] ```]

Subtract [` [$xterms] `] from both sides to get:

[``` [$yterms] = [$xterms] + [$rhs] ```]

And then divide through by [`[$c]`] to get:

[``` y = [$g1]```]

This is the equation of the given line in slope-intercept form.
Therefore the slope of this equation and the desired equation is [`m=[$m]`].

We write the slope-intercept form with this slope as:

[``` y = [$g2] + b ```]

And use the point [` [$pt] `] to find [`b `].

[```
\begin{aligned}
[$y0] & = ([$m])([$x0]) + b \\
[$y0] & = [$m*$x0] + b
\end{aligned}
```]

Next, subtract [` [$m*$x0] `] from both sides:

[``` [$b] = b```]

and finally plug this value of [`b`] into the equation:

[``` y = [$m] x + [$b] ```]
