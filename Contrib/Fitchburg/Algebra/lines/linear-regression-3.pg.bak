BEGIN_PGML
The Men's 100m freestyle (swimming) world records in given years are in the table below:
[@display_matrix([[1970,51.94],[1975,50.59],[1980,49.44],[1985,48.95],[1990,48.42],[1995,48.21],[2000,47.84]],'top_labels'=> ['year', 'Time (sec.)']); @]*

Let [`x`] be the number of years since 1970.  Find a linear model for [`T(x)`], the time of the world record that best fits this data. Write your answer in the form [`T(x) = m x + b`].  ( Use WebCAS or another software package and write the slope and y-intercept to at least 4 decimal places.)
  
[_]{}{30}

Use this linear model to predict the world record in this year's Olympics (2008).  Give your answer to hundredth's of a second.   
  
[_]{}{10} 

For your curiosity, the world record that was achieved in the 2008 Olympics was 47.05 seconds.  (Note: this is not what the linear model predicts.)
