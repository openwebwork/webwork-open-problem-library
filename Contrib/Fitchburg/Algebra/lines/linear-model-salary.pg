BEGIN_PGML
[$p] works at Electromania, an electronics super store.  [$p->They] [$p->verb('earn')]
a $[$weekly_pay] weekly salary and a commission of $[$commission] for 
each mp3 player [$p->they] [$p->verb('sell')]. 

Write a linear model that determines the amount of money that [$p] makes by selling [`x`] mp3 players.  (Write your answer as a linear function, with function name [`L`]. ) 

[_]{$f}{25}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We are looking for a linear function with name [` L`] as a function of [`x `], the number of mp3 players that she sells. 

In general a linear function has the form:

[`` L(x) = mx + b ``]

where [`m`] is this case will be her commission or [$commission].  The [`b`] term is her weekly pay or [$weekly_pay].  Therefore the function will be
[``
L(x) = [$commission] x + [$weekly_pay] ``]
