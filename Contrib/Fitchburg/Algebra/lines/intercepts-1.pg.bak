[[$SOL]]

First, let's find the x-intercept.  Recall that this means that you should set y=0.  Substitute this into the equation. 

[`` 0 = [$slope] x + [$yi] ``]

Then we need to solve for [` x `].  Next, subtract [`[$yi] `] from both sides. 

[`` [$yint2] = [$slope] x ``] 

And then divide both sides by [`[$slope] `]  or you can also multiply by [` [$invslope] `]

[`` \left([$yint2]\right)\left([$invslope]\right) = x ``] 

so the x-intercept is [` x = [$xi] `]. 

To find the y-intercept, substitute in [`x=0`] and solve for [`y`].  In this case, this is very straightforward. 

[`` y = [$slope] (0)+[$yi] = [$yi]``]

so the y-intercept is [` [$yi] `].
