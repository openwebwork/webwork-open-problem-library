[[$SOL]]

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information, start with the equation in slope-intercept form, that is, [` y = mx+b`].  Then substitute in any known information.  The desired line is parallel to the line [` [$linestr] = [$rhs]`], so first we need to write this in slope-intercept form to find the slope.  To do this, solve the equation for [`y`]. 

[`` [$linestr] = [$rhs] ``]

Subtract [` [$xterms] `] from both sides to get:

[`` [$yterms] = [$mxterms] + [$rhs] ``]

And then divide through by [$c] to get:

[`` y = [$g1]+[$yigiven]``]

This is the equation of the given line in slope-intercept form.  Therefore the slope of this equation and the desired equation is [`m=[$slope]`].  

We write the slope-intercept form with this slope as:

[`` y = [$g1] + b ``]
And use the point [` [$pt] `] to find [`b `].  

[`` 
\begin{eqnarray}
[$bb] & = &  ([$slope])([$aa]) + b \\
[$bb] & = & [$saa] + b 
\end{eqnarray} 
``] 

Next, subtract [` [$saa] `] from both sides:

[`` [$yi] = b``]
 and finally plug this value of b into the equation:

[`` y = [$slope] x + [$yi] ``]
