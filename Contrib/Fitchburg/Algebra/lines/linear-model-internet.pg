$yint  = random(30, 50, 5);
$slope = random(2,  4);

$min = random(10, 20, 5);

$gb = random(25, 40, 5);
$x  = $gb - $min;

$f = Formula("C(x)=$yint+$slope*x");
$g = Formula("$yint+$slope*(x-$min)");
$c = $g->eval(x => $gb);

BEGIN_PGML
The Interweb Connection Enterprise (or ICE) sells internet connection service.  It's monthly charges are $[$yint] for up to [$min] Gb (Gigabytes) of downloaded pages and $[$slope] for each Gb above the initial [$min] Gb.

Write a linear model that determines the monthly cost of internet service from ICE for each Gb over [$min], where [`x`] is the amount of downloads above [$min] Gb.    (Write your answer as a linear function, with function name [`C`]. )

[_]{$f}{25}

If Charlie downloads [@[$gb]@]*Gb one month, how much does he pay?  
[_]{$c}{15} 

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First, to determine the linear function, recall that it should be in the form [` C(x)=mx+b `], that is, we need to find [`m `] and [` b`].  Since there is a fixed cost for download (regardless of the amount downloaded), [`b = [$yint]`].  

Also, the per Gb rate (above [$min] Gb) is $[$slope] per Gb, thus [` m = [$slope]`].  Therefore the linear function is 

[`` C(x) = [$slope] x + [$yint] ``] 

For the second question, Charlie downloads [$gb] Gb in one month, which is [`x=[$x]`] Gb above [$min] Gb (recall what [` x`] is defined as).  Therefore we evaluate the function for this value of [`x`]. 

[``
C([$x])= [$slope] ([$x]) + [$yint] = [$c]
``]

So Charlie owes the Interweb Connection Enterprise $[$c] this month.
