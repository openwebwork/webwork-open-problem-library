# SOLUTION() works like TEXT() except that it's only shown if the "show
# solutions" flag is given. $SOL evaluates to "Solution: " in bold. Note the
# MathObjects embedded in math expressions in the solution. Remember that they
# are stringifying to their TeX representations.
SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$SOL
In this case we should write the line in slope-intercept form.  First the given line is
$BR
\( $f \)
$BR
and subtracting \($d x\) from both sides leaves
$BR
\( $c y = -$d x + $rhs \)
$BR
and finally, dividing by \($c\), we get
$BR
\( y = \frac{-$d}{$c} x + \frac{$rhs}{$c} \)
$BR
which is now in slope intercept form and the slope is the coefficient of the \(x\) term which is
$BR
\( m = \frac{-$d}{$c} = $g \)


END_SOLUTION

# This finishes everything up. It should always be the last executable line in
# the file.
