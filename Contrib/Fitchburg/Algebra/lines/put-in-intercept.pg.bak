BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[[$SOL]]

In this problem, we desire to write the line in the form:

[`` \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 ``]

There are two ways that we can do this, and we'll go through both, but you only need to do one. 

*REARRANGE TECHNIQUE* 

In this case, we use algebra to rearrange the given line into the intercept form.  We'll start by writing down the equation as given:
[`` y = [$f1] + [$yi] ``]

Next, get the x terms on the left side.  Subtract [`[$f1]`] from both sides:
[`` y - [$f1] = [$yi] ``] 

Then we divide both sides by [$yi]. 
[`` \frac{ y- [$f1]}{[$yi]} = 1 ``] 
And simplifying and rearranging we get:

[``\frac{x}{[$xi]} + \frac{y}{[$yi]} = 1 ``]

*FIND INTERCEPTS TECHNIQUE* 

In this case, we will explicitly find the x and y-intercepts and then substitute them into the correct form. 

Let's start with the line

[`` y = [$f1] + [$yi] ``]

Since this is in slope-intercept form, the y-intercept is the constant term on the right side or [$yi]. 

To find the x-intercept, recall, we need to set [` y=0`] and solve for [` x`]. 
[`` 0 = [$f1] + [$yi] ``]
Subtract [$yi] from both sides: 
[`` -[$yi] = [$f1] ``] 
and then divide by [` [$slope] `]. 
[`` -\frac{[$yi]}{[$slope]} =x ``] 
and simplify to get 
[`` [$xi] = x ``]
so [$xi] is the x-intercept. Next, plug these into the intercept form to get:
[``\frac{x}{[$xi]} + \frac{y}{[$yi]} = 1 ``]
