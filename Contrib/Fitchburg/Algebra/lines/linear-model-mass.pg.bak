BEGIN_PGML
The following table lists the population in Massachusetts in a few given years.

year Population (in Millions)   
1980 5.6   
1990 6.0   

Let [`x`] be the number of years since 1980. We seek a linear model and apply the answer during the next few steps.  

Find the slope of the line.  [`m=`][_]{}{15}. 

Write the linear model (as a linear function.  For example, [` P(x) = 0.5x+30.4 `].    
[_]{}{20}

Use the linear model above to estimate the population of Massachusetts in 1985. (Write your answer in millions.  For example, if you answer is 7,500,000, then write 7.5)

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[[$SOL]]

First, we write two points.  The first point (for year 1980) means x=0 and y=5.6 (number of millions of people) or [` (0,5.6)`] and the second point is when x=10 and y=6 or [` (10,6) `]. 

The slope of the line through these points is

[`` m = \frac{6-5.6}{10-0} = 0.04 ``] 

To write the linear model, it takes on the form [` P(x)=mx+b `], where the slope m is that above and [`b`] is the y-intercept (or the y value when x=0).  This value is 5.6, therefore the linear model is 

[`` P(x) = 0.04 x + 5.6 ``] 

And finally, the population of Massachusetts in 1985 is found by substituting [`x=5`] into the function or
[`` P(5) = 0.04(4) + 5.6 = 5.8 ``]
So there were 5.6 million people in Massachusetts in 1985.
