[[$SOL]]

In this case, we need to find the equation of the line based on the graph.  It's generally easiest to find the equation in slope-intercept form, so we will need both the slope and the y-intercept.  It hard to just look at the line to get either the slope or the y-intercept, but it appears that there are two points that are easy to see on the graph (since they fall on integer coordinates).  

These points appear to be [` ([$a],[$b])`] and [` ([$c],[$d])`], so we will find the line that passes through these points.  First, find the slope from the two points:

[`` m = \frac{[$b]-[$d]}{[$a]-[$c]} = [$slope] ``]

Then substitute this into the slope-intercept form of the line: 

[`` y = [$slope] x + b ``]

Next, substitute in the point [` ([$a],[$b])`] or

[`` 
\begin{eqnarray}
[$b] & = &  ([$slope])([$a]) + b \\
[$b] & = & [$q] + b 
\end{eqnarray} 
``] 

Next, substract [` [$q] `] from both sides:

[`` [$yint] = b``]
 and finally plug this value of b into the equation:

[`` y = [$slope] x + [$yint] ``]
