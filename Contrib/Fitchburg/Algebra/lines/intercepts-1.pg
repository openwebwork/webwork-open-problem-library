BEGIN_PGML

Find all intercepts of [` y=[$slope] x + [$yint] `].  For each, list
either DNE (if there are no intercepts), a single number or a set of
numbers separated by commas.

x-intercepts: [_]{$xint}{10}

y-intercepts: [_]{$yint}{10}

$yint2    = Fraction(-$b,     $bottom);
$invslope = Fraction($bottom, $top);

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First, let's find the x-intercept.  Recall that this means that you
should set y=0.  Substitute this into the equation.

[`` 0 = [$slope] x + [$yint] ``]

Then we need to solve for [` x `].  Next, subtract [`[$yi] `] from both sides.

[`` [$yint2] = [$slope] x ``]

And then divide both sides by [`[$slope] `]  or you can also multiply by
[` [$invslope] `]

[`` \left([$yint2]\right)\left([$invslope]\right) = x ``]

so the x-intercept is [` x = [$xint] `].

To find the y-intercept, substitute in [`x=0`] and solve for [`y`].
In this case, this is very straightforward.

[`` y = [$slope] (0)+[$yint] = [$yint]``]

so the y-intercept is [`` [$yint] ``].
