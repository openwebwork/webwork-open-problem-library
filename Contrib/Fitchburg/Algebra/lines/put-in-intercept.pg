BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

In this problem, we desire to write the line in the form:

[`` \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 ``]

There are two ways that we can do this, and we'll go through both, but you only need to do one. 

*REARRANGE TECHNIQUE* 

In this case, we use algebra to rearrange the given line into the intercept form.  We'll start by writing down the equation as given:
[``` y = [$f] ```]

Next, get the x terms on the left side.  Subtract [`[$mx]`] from both sides:
[``` y - [$mx] = [$yi] ```] 

Then we divide both sides by [$yi]. 

[``` \frac{ y- [$mx]}{[$yi]} = 1 ```]

And simplifying and rearranging we get:

[```\frac{x}{[$x0]} + \frac{y}{[$y0]} = 1 ```]

*FIND INTERCEPTS TECHNIQUE* 

In this case, we will explicitly find the x and y-intercepts and then substitute them into the correct form. 

Let's start with the line

[``` y = [$f] ```]

Since this is in slope-intercept form, the y-intercept is the constant term on the right side or [$yi]. 

To find the x-intercept, recall, we need to set [` y=0`] and solve for [` x`]. 

[``` 0 = [$f] ```]

Subtract [$yi] from both sides: 

[``` -[$yi] = [$mx] ```]

and then divide by [` [$m] `]. 

[``` -\frac{[$yi]}{[$m]} =x ```]

and simplify to get 
[`` x = [$x0] ``]
so [`[$x0]`] is the x-intercept. Next, plug these into the intercept form to get:

[```\frac{x}{[$x0]} + \frac{y}{[$y0]} = 1 ```]
