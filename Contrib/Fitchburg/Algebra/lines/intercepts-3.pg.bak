$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

For this problem there are two parts.  First, we find the \(x\)-intercepts. In this case there are two.  Set \(y=0\) in the equation given above that is
$BR
\(0= $f1  \).
$BR
Then factor the quadratic.  Recall to factor a quadratic with the coefficient of the \(x^2\) is 1, you need to find two numbers whose product is the constant term (in this case $c) and whose sum is the linear coefficient (in this case $b).  These two numbers are $negx0 and $negx1.  Therefore you can write the quadratic as:
$BR
\( 0 = (x-$x0)(x-$x1)\) 
$BR
So the \(x\)-intercepts are the values of \(x\) that make this 0 or \(x=\)\{$x0\} and \{$x1\}. 
$BR
Next, we find the \(y\)-intercept.  This means that set \(x=0\) in the equation given above that is
$BR
\( y=$yi \).
