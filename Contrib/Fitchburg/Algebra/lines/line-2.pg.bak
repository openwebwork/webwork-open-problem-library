[[$SOL]]

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information, start with the equation in slope-intercept form, that is, [` y = mx+b`].  Then substitute in any known information. We know neither the slope or the y-intercept in this case, but easily can find the slope from the two points:

[`` m = \frac{[$b]-[$d]}{[$a]-[$c]} = [$slope] ``]

Then substitute this into the slope-intercept form of the line: 

[`` y = [$slope] x + b ``]

Next, substitute in the point [` ([$a],[$b])`] or

[`` 
\begin{eqnarray}
[$b] & = &  ([$slope])([$a]) + b \\
[$b] & = & [$q] + b 
\end{eqnarray} 
``] 

Next, substract [` [$q] `] from both sides:

[`` [$yint] = b``]
 and finally plug this value of b into the equation:

[`` y = [$slope] x + [$yint] ``]
