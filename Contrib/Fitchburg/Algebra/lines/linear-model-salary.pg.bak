Sandra works at Electromania, an electronics super store.  She earns a $[$weekly_pay] weekly salary and a commission of $[$commission] for each mp3 player she sells. 

Write a linear model that determines the amount of money that Sandra makes by selling [`x`] mp3 players.  (Write your answer as a linear function, with function name [`L`]. )

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[[$SOL]]

We are looking for a linear function with name [` L`] as a function of [`x `], the number of mp3 players that she sells. 

  In general a linear function has the form:

[`` L(x) = mx + b ``]

where [`m`] is this case will be her commission or [$commission].  The b term is her weekly pay or [$weekly_pay].  Therefore the function will be
[``
L(x) = [$commission] x + [$weekly_pay] ``]
