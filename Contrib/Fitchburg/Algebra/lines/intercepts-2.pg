BEGIN_PGML

Find all intercepts of the equation [`[$lhs] = [$rhs]`]. Write your
answer as a number or a list of numbers separated by commas.  There
is no need to write your answer as a point.

x-intercepts: [_]{$xi}{10}.

y-intercepts: [_]{$yi}{10}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For this problem there are two parts.  First, we find the [`x`]-intercept.
This means that set [`y=0`] in the equation given above that is

[``` [$c] x+[$d] (0) = [$rhs]. ```]

Then divide through by [$c].

[``` x = \frac{[$rhs]}{[$c]} = [$xi] ```]

Next, we find the [`y`]-intercept.  This means that set [`x=0`] in the
equation given above that is

[``` [$c] (0) +[$d] y = [$rhs]. ```]

Then divide through by [$d].

[``` y = \frac{[$rhs]}{[$d]} = [$yi] ```]
