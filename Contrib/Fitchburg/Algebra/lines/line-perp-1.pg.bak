$y0 = random(-5, 5);
($x1, $y1) = (non_zero_random(-5, 5), non_zero_random(-5, 5));

$g = Formula("x=$x1");

BEGIN_PGML

Find an equation of the line that is perpendicular to  [` y = [$y0]`], and passes through the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

[___]{$g}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

In this case, notice that the line is horizontal (since the slope is 0).
A line that is perpendicular to a horizontal is vertical, which has the form:

[`` x= a ``]

Thus we need to find a line of this form that passes through [`([$x1],[$y1])`], and
this means that [` a=[$x1] `], therefore the line is

[`` x = [$x1]. ``]
