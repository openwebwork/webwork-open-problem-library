Find an equation of the line through [` ([$a],[$b]) `] and [` ([$c],[$d])`].
Write your answer in slope-intercept form.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information,
start with the equation in slope-intercept form, that is, [` y = mx+b`].
Then substitute in any known information. We know neither the slope or
the y-intercept in this case, but easily can find the slope from the
two points:

[``` m = \frac{[$b]-[$d]}{[$a]-[$c]} = [$slope] ```]

Then substitute this into the slope-intercept form of the line:

[``` y = [$slope] x + b ```]

Next, substitute in the point [` ([$a],[$b])`] or

[```
\begin{aligned}
[$b] & =  ([$slope])([$a]) + b \\
[$b] & = [@ $slope *$a @] + b
\end{aligned}
```]

Next, subtract [` [@ $slope *$a @] `] from both sides:

[``` [$yint] = b```]
 and finally plug this value of [`b`] into the equation:

[``` [$f] ```]
