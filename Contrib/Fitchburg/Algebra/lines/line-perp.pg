BEGIN_PGML

Find an equation of the line that is perpendicular to
[`[$line1] = [$rhs] `], and passes through the point [` [$pt] `].
Write your answer in slope-intercept form.

END_PGML

$xterms = Formula("$d x")->reduce;
$mxterms = Formula("-$d x")->reduce;
$yterms = Formula("$c y")->reduce;

$g1 = Formula("-$d/$c x + $rhs/$c")->reduce;
$g2 = Formula("-$d/$c x")->reduce;

$g3 = Formula("$c/$d x")-> reduce; 

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[``` [$line1] = [$rhs] ```]

Subtract [` [$xterms] `] from both sides to get:

[``` [$yterms] = [$mxterms] + [$rhs] ```]

And then divide through by [`[$c]`] to get:

[``` y = [$g1]```]

This is the equation of the given line in slope-intercept form.
Therefore the slope of this equation is [`m=[$m1]`].

Therefore the slope of this equation is [`m_1=[$m1]`] and the
 slope [` m_2`] of the desired line is found from

[`` m_1  m_2 = -1 ``]
or
[`` m_2 = -\frac{1}{[$m1]} = [$m2] ``]

We write the slope-intercept form with this slope as:

[`` y = [$g3] + b ``]
And use the point [` [$pt] `] to find [`b `].

[``
\begin{aligned}
[$y0] & = ([$m2])([$x0]) + b \\
[$y0] -\left([$m2*$x0]\right) & =  b \\
[$b] & = b
\end{aligned}
``]

and finally plug this value of [`b`] into the equation:

[``[$f] ``]
