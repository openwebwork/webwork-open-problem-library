BEGIN_PGML
There is a unit of temperature called Kelvin that is often used in physics.  The conversion from Fahrenheit to Kelvin can be written as a line.  If [`32^{\circ}`]F is [`273.15^{\circ}`]K and [`212^{\circ}`]F is [`373.15^{\circ}`]K.  Find the conversion from degrees K to degrees F.  (The answer should be written in terms of K.) 

F=[_]{$g}{20}.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First, note that since we are finding a function from degrees K to F, then the degrees K act like [`x`] and F acts like [`y`].   The slope would be
[``` 
\begin{aligned}
m  & = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \\
& = \frac{212-32}{373.15-273.15} \\
& = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5}
\end{aligned}
```]
Now we can either use the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form to find the line. 
The point slope form can be found with
[```
F = \frac{9}{5} (K - 273.15) + 32 
```]
