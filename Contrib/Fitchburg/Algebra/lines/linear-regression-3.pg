BEGIN_PGML
The Men's 100m freestyle (swimming) world records in given years are in the table below:

[$tab]*

Let [`x`] be the number of years since 1970.  Find a linear model for [`T(x)`], the time of the world record that best fits this data. Write your answer in the form [`T(x) = m x + b`].  ( Use WebCAS or another software package and write the slope and y-intercept to at least 4 decimal places.)
  
[_]{$line}{30}

Use this linear model to predict the world record in the 2008 Olympics.  Give your answer to hundredth's of a second.

[_]{Formula("$m x + $b")->eval(x=> 38)}{10} 

For your curiosity, the world record that was achieved in the 2008 Olympics was 47.05 seconds.  (Note: this is not what the linear model predicts.)
