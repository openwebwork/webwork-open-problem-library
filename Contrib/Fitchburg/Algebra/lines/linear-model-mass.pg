BEGIN_PGML
The following table lists the population in Massachusetts in two given years.

[$tab]*

Let [`x`] be the number of years since [$year1]. We seek a linear model and apply the answer during the next few steps.  

Find the slope of the line.  [`m=`][_]{$m}

Write the linear model (as a linear function.  For example, [` P(x) = 0.5x+30.4 `].  
[_]{$f}{20}

Use the linear model above to estimate the population of Massachusetts in [$x]. (Write your answer in millions.  
[_]{$predict}{20}
END_PGML

$x2 = $year2 - $year1;
$x3 = $x - $year1;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To find the slope of the line, we turn the table into points. The [`x`] value will be the year minus the first year or [`[$year1]`].  The first line in the table is the point 
[`(0,[$pop1])`] and the second row is [`([$x2],[$pop2])`].

The slope of the line through these points is

[``` m = \frac{[$pop2]-[$pop1]}{[$x2]-0} = [$m] ```] 

To write the linear model, it takes on the form [` P(x)=mx+b `], where the slope m is that above and [`b`] is the y-intercept (or the y value when x=0).  This value is [$pop1], from the first point. The linear model is 

[`` [$f] ``] 

And finally, the population of Massachusetts in [$x] is found by substituting 
[`x=[$x3]`] into the function or

[``` P() = [$m]([$x3]) + [$pop1] = [$predict] ```]
So we estimate that there were [$predict] million people in Massachusetts in [$x].
