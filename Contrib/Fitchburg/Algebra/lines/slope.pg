do {
    ($x0, $y0) = (random(-5, 5), random(-5, 5));
    ($x1, $y1) = (random(-5, 5), random(-5, 5));
} until ($x1 != $x0);
$m = Fraction("($y1-$y0)/($x1-$x0)");

BEGIN_PGML
Find the slope of the line through [` ([$x0],[$y0]) `] and [` ([$x1],[$y1])`].

[`m`] = [_]{$m}{30}.

Write your answer as a fraction.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Recall that we need to use the formula for the slope through the two points [`(x_1,y_1)`] and [`(x_2,y_2)`] is given by

[``` m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} ```]

Therefore in this problem it should be

[``` m = \frac{[$y1]-[$y0]}{[$x1]-[$x0]} = [$m] ```]
