BEGIN_PGML

Find an equation of the line that is perpendicular to  [`[$linestr] = [$c] `],
and passes through the point [`([$x0],[$y0])`].  Write your answer in slope-intercept form.

$xterms  = nicestring([$a],    ['x']);
$mxterms = nicestring([ -$a ], ['x']);
$yterms  = nicestring([$b],    ['y']);

$mxterms2 = nicestring([$m], ['x']);

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information, start with the equation in
slope-intercept form, that is, [`y = mx+b`].  Then substitute in any known information.
The desired line is parallel to the line [` [$linestr] = [$c]`], so first we need to
write this in slope-intercept form to find the slope.  To do this, solve the equation for [`y`].

[`` [$linestr] = [$c] ``]

Subtract [` [$xterms] `] from both sides to get:

[`` [$yterms] = [$mxterms] + [$c] ``]

And then divide through by [$a] to get:

[`` y = [$mxterms2] + [$const2] ``]

This is the equation of the given line in slope-intercept form.  Therefore the slope
of this equation is [`m_1=[$slope]`] and the slope [` m_2`] of the desired line is found from

[`` m_1  m_2 = -1 ``]

or

[`` m_2 = -\frac{1}{[$m]} = [$mperp] ``]

Use the point-slope form of the line with slope [$mperp] and point [`([$x0],[$y0])`]:

[``
\begin{align*}
y & =  m(x-x_0) + y_0 \\
& =  [$mperp] (x-[$x0]) +[$y0] \\
& =  [$ans_rhs]
\end{align*}
``]
