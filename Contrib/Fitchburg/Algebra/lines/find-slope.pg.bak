$a = random(-5, 5);
$b = random(-5, 5);

$c = non_zero_random(-5, 5, 1);
$d = random(-5, 5);

$rhs = $c * $b + $d * $a;
$f   = Formula("$d x + $c y")->reduce;
$m   = Fraction(-$d, $c)->reduce;

BEGIN_PGML
Find the slope of the line [`[$f]=[$rhs]`].

[`m=`][_]{$m}{5}.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In this case we should write the line in slope-intercept form.  First the given line is

[``` [$f]=[$rhs] ```]

and subtracting [`[$d] x`] from both sides leaves

[` [$c] y = [@-$d@] x + [$rhs] `]

and finally, dividing by [`[$c]`], we get

[` y = \frac{-[$d]}{[$c]} x + \frac{[$rhs]}{[$c]} `]

which is now in slope intercept form and the slope is the coefficient of the [`x`] term which is

[` m = \frac{-[$d]}{[$c]} = [$m] `]
