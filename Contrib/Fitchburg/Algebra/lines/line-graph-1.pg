BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

In this case, we need to find the equation of the line based on the graph.
It's generally easiest to find the equation in slope-intercept form, so we
will need both the slope and the y-intercept.  It hard to just look at the
line to get either the slope or the y-intercept, but it appears that there
are two points that are easy to see on the graph (since they fall on integer
coordinates).

These points appear to be [` ([$a],[$b])`] and [` ([$c],[$d])`], so we will
find the line that passes through these points.  First, find the slope from
the two points:

[`` m = \frac{[$b]-[$d]}{[$a]-[$c]} = [$slope] ``]

Then substitute this into the slope-intercept form of the line:

[`` y = [$slope] x + b ``]

Next, substitute in the point [` ([$a],[$b])`] or

[``
\begin{aligned}
[$b] & = ([$slope])([$a]) + b \\
[$b] & = [$q] + b
\end{aligned}
``]

Next, substract [` [$q] `] from both sides:

[`` [$yint] = b``]
 and finally plug this value of b into the equation:

[`` y = [$f] ``]
