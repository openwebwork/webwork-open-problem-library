BEGIN_PGML
Find an equation of the line with slope [``[$slope] ``]
that passes through the point  [` ([$a],[$b])`].  Write your solution
in slope-intercept form.

$c = Compute("$slope*$a");

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When trying to find the equation of a line with some information, start with the equation in slope-intercept form, that is, [` y = mx+b`].  Then substitute in any known information.  In this case, we know the slope is [`m=[$slope]`], or

[`` y = [$slope] x + b ``]

Next, substitute in the point [` ([$a],[$b])`] or

[```
\begin{aligned}
[$b] & =   ([$slope])([$a]) + b \\
[$b] & =  [$c] + b
\end{aligned}
```]

Next, substract [` [$c] `] from both sides:

[``` [$yint] = b```]

and finally plug this value of b into the equation:

[``` y = [$slope] x + [$yint] ```]
