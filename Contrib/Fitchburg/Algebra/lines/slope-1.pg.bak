# SOLUTION() works like TEXT() except that it's only shown if the "show
# solutions" flag is given. $SOL evaluates to "Solution: " in bold. Note the
# MathObjects embedded in math expressions in the solution. Remember that they
# are stringifying to their TeX representations.
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[[$SOL]]
Recall that we need to use the formula for the slope through the two points [`(x_1,y_1)`] and [`(x_2,y_2)`] is given by 
  
[` m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} `]
  
Therefore in this problem it should be
  
[` m = \frac{[$d]-[$b]}{[$c]-[$a]} = [$m] `]

END_PGML_SOLUTION

# This finishes up the solution
