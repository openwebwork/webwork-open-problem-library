BEGIN_PGML
The goal of this problem is to use completing the square to write a 
quadratic in standard form, [` q(x) = a(x-h)^2 +k `]

Consider the quadratic equation given by [`q(x)=[$quad]`].

First, factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms:

[`q(x)=`][___]{$a}[``\biggl(``][_______]{$ans1}[``\biggr)[$plusC]``]

END_PGML

$bovera = Compute("$b/$a")->reduce;
$partA = Compute("x^2 +$bovera x")->reduce; 

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let the coefficient of [`x^2`] be [`a =[$a]`].  Factor this out of the first 
two terms leading to:

[``q(x) = [$a] \biggl([$partA] \biggr) [$plusC]``]
END_PGML_SOLUTION

Section::Begin("Part 2: Finding the Perfect Square");

$fr = Compute("$b/$a")->reduce;
$part2 = "$a\left(x^2" . ($a*$b < 0  || '+') . $fr->TeX . " x \right)";

BEGIN_PGML
The quadratic is now [`q(x) = [$part2][$plusC]`].

We now wish to find the first term as a perfect square:

[` q(x) = [$a]\left(x^2+[$fr]x +\right.`] [___________]{$hsq} 
[`\left. \right)[$plusC]+`][__________]{$additional}

END_PGML

$ahsq = Formula("$a * $hsq")->reduce; 

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
For this step, we need to find the term that will make a perfect square and the outer
term is adjusted.  The term inside the parentheses is found by taking half of the 
[`x`] coefficient and then squaring it.  In this case, it is [``[$hsq]``]. 

Since you have included [``[$a] \cdot [$hsq] =[$ahsq]``], you also need to 
[@ $ahsq < 0 ? 'add' : 'subtract' @] it as well, resulting in the last term.

$dd    = 4 * $asq;
$part3 ="$a\left(x^2" . ($a*$b < 0  || '+') . $fr->TeX . " x + " . $hsq->TeX . "\right)"
. ($d <0 ? '' : '+') . $d->TeX; 
# $part3 = "$a\left(x^2 + $fr x + \frac{$bsq}{$dd}\right)+" . $d->TeX;
$inner = Compute("x+$h")->reduce;


BEGIN_PGML
From the last part you wrote [`q(x)=[$part3]`].  Write [`q(x)`] as a perfect square:

[`q(x)=[$a](`][______________]{$inner}[`)^2`] [@($d <0 ? '' : '\(+\)')@] [`[$d]`]

END_PGML

$innersq = "x^2" . ($a*$b < 0  || '+') . $fr->TeX . " x + " . $hsq->TeX; 
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
For the last step, we write the term [``[$innersq]``] as a perfect square.  This can be
found by taking half of the [`x`] coefficient.  Thus 

[``q(x)=[$part3] = [$a] \left([$inner]\right)^2``] [@($d <0 ? '' : '\(+\)')@] [``[$d]``]
