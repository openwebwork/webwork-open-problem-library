$a = non_zero_random(-1, 1) * random(2, 5);

BEGIN_PGML

The goal of this problem is to use completing the square to write a quadratic in standard form, [` q(x) = a(x-h)^2 +k `]

Section::Begin("Part 1: Factoring out the leading Coefficient");

$quad  = Formula("$a x^2 + $b x + $c")->reduce;
$plusC = $c < 0 ? $c : "+" . $c;

BEGIN_PGML
Consider the quadratic equation given by [`q(x)=[$quad]`].

First, factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms:

[`q(x)=`][___]{$a}([_______]{Formula("x^2+($b/$a)x")})[`[$plusC]`]

END_PGML

$bovera = Compute("$b/$a")->reduce;
$partA  = Compute("x^2 +$bovera x")->reduce;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let the coefficient of [`x^2`] be [`a =[$a]`].  Factor this out of the first 
two terms leading to:

[``q(x) = [$a] \biggl([$partA] \biggr) [$plusC]``]

Context('Fraction');
$h   = Fraction(-$b,   2 * $a);
$hsq = Fraction($b**2, 4 * $a**2);

$additional = -1 * $hsq * $a;

BEGIN_PGML
The quadratic is now [``q(x) = [$a]\bigl([$partA]\bigr) [$plusC]``].

We now wish to find the first term as a perfect square by adding inside and outside the parentheses making sure
that you are adding 0.

[` q(x) = [$a]\left([$partA] +\right.`] [___________]{$hsq} [`\left. \right)[$plusC]+`][__________]{$additional}

END_PGML

$ahsq = Formula("$a * $hsq")->reduce;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
For this step, we need to find the term that will make a perfect square and the outer
term is adjusted.  The term inside the parentheses is found by taking half of the 
[`x`] coefficient and then squaring it.  In this case, it is [``[$hsq]``]. 

Since you have included [``[$a] \cdot [$hsq] =[$ahsq]``], you also need to 
[@ $ahsq < 0 ? 'add' : 'subtract' @] it as well, resulting in the last term.

$d     = Fraction(4 * $a * $c - $b * $b, 4 * $a);
$plusd = ($d < 0 ? '' : '+') . "$d";
$part3 = Formula("x^2 - 2 $h x + $hsq")->reduce;

$inner = Compute("x-$h")->reduce;

BEGIN_PGML
From the last part you wrote [``q(x)=[$a]\left([$part3]\right)[$plusd]``].  Write [`q(x)`] as a perfect square:

[`q(x)=[$a](`][______________]{$inner}[``)^2[$plusd]``]

END_PGML

# $innersq = "x^2" . ($a*$b < 0  || '+') . $fr->TeX . " x + " . $hsq->TeX;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
For the last step, we write the term [``[$part3]``] as a perfect square.  This can be
found by taking half of the [`x`] coefficient.  Thus 

[``q(x)=[$a]\left([$part3]\right)[$plusd] = [$a] \left([$inner]\right)^2[$plusd]``]
