$year = 1995 + random(4, 20);

$power = 5 * exp(0.245 * ($year - 1995));

BEGIN_PGML
The use of wind power across the globe is increasing in an exponential way
(The Economist, December 6, 2008). If the number of megawatts of generated
electricity can be written as

[```P (t) = 5e^{0.245t} ```]

where [`P(t)`] is the number of megawatts (MW) of power generated by wind
turbines in the world and t is given in the number of years since 1995.

Use the model to estimate the number of megawatts of wind power generated in
[$year]. Leave at least 5 or 6 decimal places.

Power generated = [_____]{$power}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The value of [`t`] when in [$year] is [$year-1995]. Plug this into the model
[```
  \begin{aligned}
  P([$year-1995]) = 5 e^{0.245 \cdot [$year-1995]} = [@Round($power,6)@]
  \end{aligned}
```]
