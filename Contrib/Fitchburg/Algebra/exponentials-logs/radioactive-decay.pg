BEGIN_PGML
A sample of burned wood is found to contain [$m] mg of carbon-14.
If it initially contained [$m0] mg of carbon-14, find the age of the wood.
(Hint: recall that the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years).

age = [____]{$age} years. (Round your answer to the nearest year.)

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let [`k = 5730`] be the half-life of carbon.  We'll use an exponential model
for this or
[```
  m(t)  = a e^{k t}
```]
and since [`m(0)=a = [$m0]`] and then using the half-life, we know that when
[`t=5730`], then [`m(5730) = \frac{1}{2} [$m0]`] so
[```
m(5730) = \frac{1}{2} [$m0] = [$m0] e^{5730 k}
```]
Solve for [`k`]:
[```
\begin{aligned}
\ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) & = 5730 k \\
\frac{1}{5730} \ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) & = k
\end{aligned}
```]
This means that the model for the amount carbon is
[```
m(t) = [$m0] e^{t\ln(1/2)/5730}
```]

Now we use the [$m] mg that was given in the problem
[```
\begin{aligned}
[$m] = [$m0] e^{t \ln (1/2)/5730} \\
\frac{[$m]}{[$m0]} & = e^{t \ln(1/2)/5730} \\
\ln \left(\frac{[$m]}{[$m0]}\right) &= t \ln(1/2)/5730 \\
\frac{5730}{\ln(1/2)} \ln\left(\frac{[$m]}{[$m0]}\right) & = t \\
[@ -5730/log(2)*ln($m/$m0) @] & = t
\end{aligned}
```]
and rounding leaves with the answer [`t\approx[$age]`].
