$year = 1905 + random(0, 90, 10);

$pop = 2.805 * exp(0.00913 * ($year - 1900));

BEGIN_PGML
The population model for Massachusetts between 1900 and 2000 is
[```P(x) = 2.805 e^{0.00913x} ```]
where [`P(x)`] is the population of Massachusetts in millions and [`x`] is
the number of years since 1900.

Use the model to estimate the population in Massachusetts in [$year]. Leave your
answer in millions and leave at least 5 or 6 decimal places.

Population = [____]{$pop}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The value of [`x`] when in [$year] is [$year-1900]. Plug this into the model
[```
  \begin{aligned}
  P([$year-1900]) = 2.805 e^{0.00913 \cdot [$year-1900]} = [@Round($pop,6)@]
  \end{aligned}
```]
