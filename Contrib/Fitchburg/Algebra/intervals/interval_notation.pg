BEGIN_PGML
Let [`A=[[$a],[$b]), B=(-\infty,[$c])`] and [`C=[[$d],\infty)`].
Write the following set operations using interval notation:

a. [`A \cup B=`] [_____]{$ans1}
b. [`A \cup B \cup C= `] [_____]{$ans2}
c. [`A \cap C=`] [_____]{$ans3}

$solnA = $c >= $a ? 'Since the intervals \(A\) and \(B \)  overlap, the union is from \(-\infty \) '
  . "to $c" :
  'Since the intervals \(A\) and \(B \) do not overlap, then the union is just';

$solnB = $c > $d ? "The union of all three intervals is the collection overlap "
. "of all three (or the shadow of all three).  Since there are no gaps on "
. "the overlap, this is \((-\infty,\infty)\)." :
"In this case intervals \(B\) and \(C\) do not overlap, but \(A \) and \(C\) "
. "do, therefore the union of all three is the union of \(B\) and \(C\) "
. "or \((-\infty,$c) \cup [$d,\infty)\)";

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
These can often be done with graphs of number lines:

>> [!!]{$graph}{400} <<

Where the set [`A`], [`B`] and [`C`] are shown from bottom to top.

a. [$solnA] or [`[$ans1]`].

b. [$solnB]

c. [`A \cap C`] is the common interval between [`A`] and [`C`]. This is between
[$d] and [$b] and taking into account the fact that [$d] is included, but
[$b] is not, the answer is [`[$ans3]`].
