BEGIN_PGML

This problem talks about how to put in square roots in WeBWorK.  Generally, one uses the 'sqrt' function.  For example, to enter [`\sqrt{5}`], type [| sqrt(5) |].

This will also work with functions.  One can enter [`\sqrt{2x+1}`] as [| sqrt(2x+1) |]

Enter [`\sqrt{[$a]}`]  [________]{$ans1}

Enter [`\sqrt{[$f]}`]  [________]{$ans2}

Often, WeBWorK problems will require you to put in an answer exactly.  If the answer has a square root, then you should put it in as such instead of use a calculator to 'turn it into a decimal', which is actually an approximation.

Enter [`\sqrt{[$a]}`] [_________]{$ans1}  (Note: enter this as a decimal.  That is use you calculator).


Now try to enter [`\sqrt{[$a]}`] as a decimal [________]{$ans1->cmp(tolerance=>0)}

You should notice that you it won't accept a decimal.  In this case, put in your answer as a square root.  In general, it is always recommended to enter things in exact form (that is, don't use a calculator to turn it into a decimal.

### Roots as Powers ###

Recall that another way to express a square root is using the power of 1/2.  For example, [`\sqrt{5}`] can also be written as [`5^{1/2}`].

Enter in [`\sqrt{[$a]}`] using a power [_______]{$ans1->cmp(tolerance=>0)}

Enter in [`\sqrt{[$f]}`] using a power [________]{$ans2}

The easier way to enter cube roots or other roots is with the power.  Recall that a cube root is the power to the 1/3.

Enter [`\sqrt[3]{[$b]}`]  [___________]{$ans3->cmp(tolerance=>0)}

Enter [`\sqrt[[$root4]]{[$b4]}`] [_________]{$ans4->cmp(tolerance=>0)}

Enter [`\sqrt[[$root5]]{[$f5]}`] [_________]{$ans5}
