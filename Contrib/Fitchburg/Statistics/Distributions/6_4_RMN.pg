BEGIN_PGML
Suppose that the distance of fly balls hit to the outfield (in baseball) is
normally distributed with a mean of [$mu] feet and a standard deviation of [$sigma]
feet.

a. If one fly ball is randomly chosen from this distribution, what is the
probability that this ball traveled less than [$a] feet?.[____]{$Pa}
b. If one fly ball is randomly chosen from this distribution, what is the
probability that this ball traveled more than [$b] feet?.[____]{$Pb}
c. If one fly ball is randomly chosen from this distribution, what is the
probability that this ball traveled between [$c] and [$d] feet?.[____]{$Pcd}
d. The [$k]th percentile of the distribution of fly balls is [____]{$Xk} feet.
e. The middle [$m]% of fly ball distances fall between [____]{$X1} and [____]{$X2} feet.
