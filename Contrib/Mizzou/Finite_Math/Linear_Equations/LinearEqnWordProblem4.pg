A hockey arena merchandise shop sells two types of jerseys: practice jerseys and game-worn jerseys.  Practice jerseys cost $p1 while game-worn jerseys cost $p2 each.  If during one particular month, the merchandise shop sells $u total jerseys and earns a revenue of $r, how many of each type of jersey did they sell that month?

Number of practice jerseys = \{ans_rule(5)\}

Number of game-worn jerseys = \{ans_rule(5)\}
