BEGIN_TEXT
Our second evening exam for this course is on \{ $exam1 -> menu() \}.
$PAR
As indicated in the syllabus, to request an Alternate Exam for a scheduled conflict, students must submit a request via the Alternate Exam Request Form at least \{ $weeks->menu()\} week(s) before of the exam.  
$PAR
Failure to do so will result in an automatic exam score penalty of \{ $percent -> menu() \}.
$PAR
Note: You can find the Alternate Exam Request Form in our Blackboard course site under "Exam Information"; you can also find it by \{ htmlLink("javascript:windowpopup();", "clicking here.") \}
$PAR
The location of your evening exams depends on which section you are in, and are posted on Blackboard. Students are required to take the exams in their assigned locations.  
$PAR
Each exam will start promptly at the time indicated in this syllabus. All students are expected to arrive at their assigned exam locations early enough to be seated and ready to begin the exam at the indicated start time. It is each student's responsibility to make all necessary arrangements to arrive at the correct exam location on time. Students who live off campus should take extra care to arrange for reliable transportation and to arrive on campus well in advance of the exam start times. Students who arrive late or miss an exam due to lack of transportation will not be given extra time or a make-up exam. Additionally, students who take the exam in the wrong room will be penalized by taking 10% off their exam score. These policies apply to the Final Exam as well.
