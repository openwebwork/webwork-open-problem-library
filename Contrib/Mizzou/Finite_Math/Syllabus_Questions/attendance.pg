BEGIN_TEXT
Attendance is vital to your success in this course.  You are expected to attend all scheduled class sessions, and attendance will be taken regularly.  If you are to miss class for any reason, you are responsible for any notes or announcements given during class.  Students who arrive late or leave early may be considered absent.  All absences are treated equally, regardless of the reason – there are no “excused” or “unexcused” absences.  Although we understand that there may be legitimate reasons for missing class, it is expected that students will limit their absences in order to avoid the penalties outlined below.
$PAR
Any students who reach the equivalent of 3 full weeks of absences from class will be subject to a letter grade reduction for their ﬁnal course grade. (i.e. A grade of B+ would be reduced to B, A- reduced to B+, etc.) Additionally, prior to April 8, students who miss the equivalent of three weeks of class time and have an exam average of lower than a C- will be dropped from the class due to poor attendance. This means that, if you $PAR

(a) are in a section that meets two days a week, miss \{$absences2day->menu()\} class periods, and have an exam average of lower than a C-, or $BR

(b) are in a section that meets three days a week, miss \{$absences3day->menu()\} class periods, and have an exam average of lower than a C- $PAR

then prior to April 8 you will be dropped from the class due to poor attendance and after April 8 you will be subject to a letter grade reduction for your ﬁnal course grade

$PAR
Don't skip class unless absolutely necessary.  Research consistently show that students who attend class regularly have higher achievement scores than those who do not!
