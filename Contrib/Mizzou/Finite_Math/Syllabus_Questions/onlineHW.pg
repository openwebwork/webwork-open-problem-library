BEGIN_TEXT
In $course, there will be online homework due every \{ $weekdays -> menu() \}
at \{ $times -> menu() \}.  Every week a new assignment will become available exactly when the previous assignment is due.  So students will have at least a full week to work on each online homework assignment.
$PAR
The only exceptions to this are this assignment (due $formattedDueDate), weeks in which we have exams, $breakName, and the last online homework.  Online homework will not be due during exam weeks or $breakName.  And, due to Reading Day and Finals Week, the last online homework will be due on $lastHW at $hwTime.
$PAR
There will be \{ $num_homeworks -> menu() \} online homework assignments, and each online homework will be worth \{ $points -> menu() \} points.  At the end of the semester we will drop \{ $drop -> menu() \} online homework(s) before computing your total score.
$PAR
As stated in the syllabus, there will be absolutely no make-ups or extensions on the online homework for any reason.  You will be given at least one full week to work every assignment, and you may attempt every problem as often as needed - the system will always keep your highest score.
$PAR
The key to success is getting started early on each assignment; they will cover material presented in class during the prior week.  We suggest that every $hwDay, you print a copy of the new assignment and begin working on the problems over the weekend.  You then have most of the week to ask about the questions in class, get help at your instructor's office hours, etc.
$PAR
Again, there will be no make-ups or extensions given for the online homework for any reason.
