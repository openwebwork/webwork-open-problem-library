BEGIN_TEXT
A list of assigned homework can be found in our Blackboard course site under "Calendar and HW." The list is also available on the web by \{ htmlLink( "javascript:windowpopup();", "clicking here." ) \}
$PAR
The written homework will not be collected. However, nearly every week there will be an in class $BBOLD pop-quiz $EBOLD in which students must solve one or two problems from the written homework. 
$PAR
The first quiz will be during Week 2; there will not be in-class quizzes during exam weeks. There will be a total of 11 in-class quizzes, each worth \{ $points -> menu()\} points.  There are a total of 50 points available to be earned from in-class quizzes.  One in-class quiz (your lowest score) will be dropped before computing your total in-class quiz score. 
$PAR
$BBOLD Important Notes:$EBOLD $BR
These are pop-quizzes in the sense that your instructor will not announce in advance the day of the quiz or the problem(s) appearing on the quiz. However, those problems will always be from the \{htmlLink("javascript:windowpopup();","Calendar and HW List") \} and from a section recently covered in class.  It is your responsibility to keep up with the homework (both written and online), and to ask about any problems you have trouble with.
$PAR
No make-ups will be given for the in-class quizzes, except for University approved travel.  MU athletes who miss a quiz due to team travel must provide a letter or email from the Total Person Program.
