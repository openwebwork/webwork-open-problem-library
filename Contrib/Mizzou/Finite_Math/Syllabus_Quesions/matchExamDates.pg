Exam 1, Exam 2 and Exam 3 are each worth 100 points. The final exam is cumulative and is worth 200 points.
$PAR
The location of your evening exam depends on which section you are in and will be announced on Blackboard when available. 
    
$PAR
Each exam will start promptly at the time indicated in this syllabus. All students are expected to arrive at their assigned exam locations early enough to be seated and ready to begin the exam at the indicated start time. It is each student's responsibility to make all necessary arrangements to arrive at the correct exam location on time. Students who live off campus should take extra care to arrange for reliable transportation and to arrive on campus well in advance of the exam start times. Students who arrive late or miss an exam due to lack of transportation will not be given extra time or a make-up exam. Additionally, students who take the exam in the wrong room will be penalized by taking 10% off their exam score. These policies apply to each of our three evening exams and to the final exam. 
$PAR
Practice exams will be provided by the Learning Center, and you can find exams from previous semesters, with solutions, in our Blackboard course site under "Exam Information."
