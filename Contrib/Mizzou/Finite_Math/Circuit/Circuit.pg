Engineers constructed the following circuit with two relays (labeled 1 and 2).  In order for current to travel through the circuit from point A to point B, at least one of the two relays needs to be activated.  However, both relays 1 and 2 are faulty.  Relay 1 works probability \($a\), and relay \(2\) works with probability \($b\).  Assuming the relays work independently, what is the probability that the current can travel from point A to point B?

The probability that the current can travel from pount A to B is \{ANS_RULE(10)\}.
