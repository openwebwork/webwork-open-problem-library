BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
The APY is given by\(APY = e^r -1 \).  With the problem at hand, we need to solve the equation
$PAR
\[
\left( 1 + \frac{r}{$compoundings_per_year} \right)^{$compoundings_per_year} - 1 = \left(1 + \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year2}\right)^{$compoundings_per_year2} - 1
\]
$PAR
for \(r\).  This yields \(r = $answerdec \text{ or } $answer $PERCENT\).
