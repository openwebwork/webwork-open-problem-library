BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is an application of the formula \(A = P(1+i)^n\) with 
\[
A = 2P, \text{ and } i = \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year}.
\]
$PAR
Note that we do not know \(P\) nor do we need to.  Plugging in all the known values, we see that we have to solve:
\[
2P = P\cdot \left(1 + \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year}\right)^{n}.
\]
$PAR
Dividing both sides by \(P\), and taking a natural log, we see that
\[
\ln\left( \frac{2P}{P} \right) = \ln\left(\left(1+\frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year}\right)^n\right).
\]
$PAR
Using the natural log rule \(\ln(x^r) = r \ln(x)\), we see that
$PAR
\[
\ln(2) = n \ln\left(1 + \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year} \right)
\]
$PAR
which yields \(n = $nvalue\).  Since we need to invest money for at least this amount of time to double the principal, we need to round up giving an answer of $answer $periods.
