BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
The APY is given by either \(APY = (1 + i)^m - 1\) or \(APY = e^r -1 \) depending on whether the interest is being compounded continuously or $m$ times per year.  With the problem at hand, we need to solve the equation
$PAR
\[
e^r - 1 = \left(1 + \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year2}\right)^{$compoundings_per_year2}
\]
$PAR
for $r$.  This yields \(r = $answerdec \quad \text{ or } \quad $answer $PERCENT\).
