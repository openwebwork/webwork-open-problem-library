If you invest \($principal\) into an account earning an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\), how much will you have in your account after \($time\) years if the interest is compounded $periodically1?  If the interest is compounded $periodically2?  If the interest is compounded continuously?

$PAR
If interest is compounded $periodically1: \{ANS_RULE(10)\} 
$PAR
If interest is compounded $periodically2: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
If interest is compounded continuously: \{ANS_RULE(10)\} 
$PAR
