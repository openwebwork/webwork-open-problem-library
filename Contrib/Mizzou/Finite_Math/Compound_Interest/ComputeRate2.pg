At what interest rate (compounded $periodically) should you invest if you would like to grow \($principal\) to \($amount\) in \($time\) $periods?

$PAR
\{ANS_RULE(10)\} \($PERCENT\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is an application of the formula \(A = P(1+i)^n\) with 
\[
A = $amount, P = $principal, i = \frac{r}{$compoundings_per_year}, \text{ and } n = $time.
\]
$PAR
Plugging in all the known values, we see that we have to solve:
\[
$amount = $principal \cdot \left(1 + \frac{r}{$compoundings_per_year}\right)^{$time}.
\]
$PAR
Next, divide both sides by \($principal\) and take the $time-th root:
\[
\left( \frac{$amount}{$principal} \right)^{\frac{1}{$time}} = 1 + i.
\]
$PAR
Subtracting \(1\) from both sides of the equation gives
\[
\frac{r}{$compoundings_per_year} = \left( \frac{$amount}{$principal} \right)^{\frac{1}{$time}} - 1
\]
$PAR
Finally, multiply both sides of the equation by $compoundings_per_year gives
$BR
\[
r = $dec.
\]
As a percentage correct to two decimal places it is $ans2$PERCENT.
