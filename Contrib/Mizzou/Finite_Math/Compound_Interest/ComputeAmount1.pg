If you invest \($principal\) in an account earning an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded $periodically, how much will be in your account after \($time1\) years?  After \($time2\) years?

$PAR
After \($time1\)  years: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}  (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
$BR

$PAR
After \($time2\) years: \{ANS_RULE(10)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
The first question is a simple application of \(A = P(1+i)^n\) with 
\[
P = $principal, \qquad i = \frac{r}{m} = \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year}, \qquad \text{and} \qquad n = mt = $compoundings_per_year \cdot $time1.
\]
This yields \(A = $answer1\).  The second part is done similarly.
