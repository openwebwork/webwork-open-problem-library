Suppose you deposit \($principal\) into two different bank accounts.  Account A earns an annual simple interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\).  Account B earns an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded $periodically.  After \($time\) years, how much is in each account.  How much more money interest did you earn in Account B than you did in Account A?


$PAR
Amount in Account A: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}  
$BR

$PAR
Amount in Account B: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$BR

$PAR
How much more interest did you earn in Account B than you did in Account A? \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR


 (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answers should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
The amount in Account A is given by \(A = P(1+rt)\) with 
\[
P = $principal, \qquad r = $dec, \qquad \text{and} \qquad t = $time.
\]
$PAR
This yields \(A = $answer1\) is in account A.  
$PAR
The amount in Account B  is given by \(A = P(1+i)^n\) with 
\[
P = $principal, \qquad i = \frac{r}{m} = \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year}, \qquad \text{and} \qquad n = mt = $compoundings_per_year \cdot $time.
\]
$PAR
This yields \(A = $answer2\) is in account B.
$PAR
Thus, there is \($answer2 - $answer1 = $answer3\) more in Account B.
