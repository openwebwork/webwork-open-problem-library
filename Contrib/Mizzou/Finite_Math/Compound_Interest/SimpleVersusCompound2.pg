Suppose you deposit \($Principal\) into two different bank accounts.  Account A earns an annual simple interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\).  Account B earns an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded $periodically.  After \($time\) years, how much is in each account.  How much more money interest did you earn in Account B than you did in Account A?


$PAR
Amount in Account A: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}  
$BR

Amount in Account B: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
