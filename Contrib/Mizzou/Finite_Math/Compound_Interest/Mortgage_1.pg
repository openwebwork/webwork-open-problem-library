Fifteen years ago a couple purchased a house for \( $house_value \) by paying a 20 $PERCENT down payment and financing the remaining balance with a 30-year mortgage at \($rate\)$PERCENT compounded monthly.
$PAR
(a) Find the monthly payment for this loan.
$PAR
Monthly Payment: \{ans_rule(10)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
$PAR
(b) Find the balance of the loan after \( $years1 \) years and after \( $years2 \) years?
$PAR

\{ endtable() \}
$ECENTER
(${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD The balance amounts should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
$PAR
(c) Find the total amount of interest paid by the couple during the \{$years2."th"\} year.
$PAR
Interest Paid During \{$years2."th"\} year: \{ans_rule(10)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
