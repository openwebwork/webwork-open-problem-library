Dan and Andrea estimate that they want to buy a house for \($house_value\), and they need to make a down payment of \($down $PERCENT\) of the cost of their house.  If they have \($months\) months to save for the down payment, how much do they need to invest into an account earning \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded continuously so that they can reach their goal?

$PAR
Dan and Andrea need to invest \{ANS_RULE(10)\}.

(${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD Your answer should have a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This an application of the formula \(A = Pe^{rt}\) with 
\[
A = $down_dec \cdot $house_value, r = $dec, \text{ and } t = $months/12.
\]
$PAR
This yields \(P = $answer\).
