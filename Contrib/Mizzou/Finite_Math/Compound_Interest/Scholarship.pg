BEGIN_TEXT

Most scholarships are established by making a one time deposit into an account.  The scholarship money is then taken from the earned interest on the account at the end of each investment year.  How much money should you deposit into an account earning an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded $periodically to establish an annual scholarship worth \($interest\)?
