BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you invest \($principal\) into an account earning an interest rate of \($initial_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded continuously for \($time1\) year(s) and thereafter earning an interest rate of \($secondary_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded $periodically.  How much money is in the account after \($time2\) years?

$PAR
The amount in the account is \{ANS_RULE(10)\}.
$PAR
(${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD Your answer should have a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

BEGIN_HINT
First, compute the amount of money in the account after \($time1\) year(s).
