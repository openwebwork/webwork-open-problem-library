Jaco from wants to buy a new bass guitar which costs \($guitar_price\) plus tax.  If his state's sale tax is \($sales_tax $PERCENT\) and he saves for \($months\) months, how much should he deposit into a bank account earning an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded continuously if he wants to meet his goal?

$PAR
Jaco needs to deposit \{ANS_RULE(10)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This an application of the formula \(A = Pe^{rt}\) with 
\[
A = $guitar_price, r = $dec, \text{ and } t = $months/12.
\]
$PAR
This yields \(P = $answer\).
