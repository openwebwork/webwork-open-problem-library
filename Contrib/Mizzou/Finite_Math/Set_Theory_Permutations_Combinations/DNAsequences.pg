A DNA sequence can be represented as a string of the letters ACTG (short for adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine).  
$PAR
$SPACE (a) How many DNA sequences are exactly $seq letters long?   \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
$SPACE (b) Given a DNA sequence of length $seq, how many single letter mutations are possible?

\{ANS_RULE(10)\}

$PAR
$SPACE (c) Given a DNA sequence of length $seq, how many double letter mutations are possible?

\{ANS_RULE(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
$SPACE (a) There are \(4\) possibilities for each sequence, and thus there are \(4^{$seq} = $answer1\) DNA sequences which are \($seq\) letters long.
$PAR
$SPACE (b) Given a sequence of \($seq\) characters, we want to count the number of ways to change one character.  There are \($seq\) characters, and each character has \(3\) possibilites in which to change (for example, an "A" can change to a "C", "G", or "T").  Thus there are \($seq \cdot 3 = $answer2\) possible single-letter mutations.
$PAR
$SPACE (c) To have a double-letter mutation, we choose two of the \($seq\) characters (and there are \( C($seq,2) = $a\) ways to choose two letters of the sequence of \($seq\) characters.  Furthermore, each character has \(3 \) possible new values, so the number of double-letter mutations possible is \(C($seq,2) \cdot 3^2 = $answer3\).
