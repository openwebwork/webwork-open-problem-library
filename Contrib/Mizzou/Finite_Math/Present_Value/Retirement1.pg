BEGIN_TEXT

A person wants to establish an annuity for retirement.  He wants to make \{$comp."ly"\} deposits for \( $deposit_years \) years so that he can then make \{$comp."ly"\} withdraws of \( $PMT \) for \( $withdraw_years \) years.  The annuity earns \( $rate \)$PERCENT compounded \{$comp."ly"\}.
$PAR
(a) How much will have to be in the account at the time he retires?
$PAR
Value of account at retirement: \{ans_rule(10)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

$PAR
(b) How much should be deposited each $comp for \( $deposit_years \) years in order to accumulate the required amount?
$PAR
\{ $comp2."ly"\} deposit: \{ans_rule(10)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
$PAR
(c) What is the total amount of interest earned during the \($total_years\)-year period?
$PAR
Total Interest Earned: \{ans_rule(10)\} 
(${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
