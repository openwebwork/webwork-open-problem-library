A family bought a house for \($house_value\).  They paid \($down $PERCENT\) down, and mortgaged the remainder over $time years at an annual interest rate \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded monthly.

$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
For the first part, we use the present value formula 
$PAR\[
PV = PMT \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i},
\]$PAR
with \(PV = $house_value \cdot (1 - $downdec) = $mortgage_amt, \text{ }i = \frac{$dec}{12}, \text{ and }n = $time \cdot 12\).  Plugging in, we have
$PAR\[
$mortgage_amt = PMT \frac{1 - \left(1 + \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{12 \cdot$time}}{\frac{$dec}{12}},
\]$PAR
which yields \(PMT = $answer1\).
$PAR
To find the amount of interest paid, we note that over the course of the $time years, we paid a total amount of 
$PAR\[
$answer1 \cdot 12 \cdot $time = $total.
\]$PAR
Since the house mortgage was for \($mortgage_amt\), we see that the total interest paid over the course of the entire mortgage was
$PAR\[
$total - $mortgage_amt = $answer2!
\]$PAR
