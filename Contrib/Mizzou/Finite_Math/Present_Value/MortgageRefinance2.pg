BEGIN_TEXT

A family purchased a house $time1 years ago for \($house_value\).  They paid \($down \)$PERCENT down, and mortgaged the remainder over 30 years at an annual interest rate \($annual_interest_rate1\)$PERCENT compounded monthly.  Since then, interest rates have dropped, and the family wants to refinance the unpaid balance of the mortgage by signing a $time2 year mortgage at \($annual_interest_rate2 \)$PERCENT compounded monthly.  How much interest will the family save by refinancing the mortgage?

$PAR
a) Find the monthly payment on the original mortgage: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
b) Find the unpaid balance of the mortgage after $time1 years: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
c) How much interest will the family save by refinancing the mortgage? \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR

(${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD Your answers should have a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
