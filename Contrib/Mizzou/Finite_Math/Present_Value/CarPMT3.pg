Rich buys a car for \($price\) and has two options for financing.  The dealership offers either financing of \( 0 \)$PERCENT compounded monthly for 5-years, or a \($rebate\) cash rebate.  If Rich takes the rebate, then he will apply the rebate to the cost of the car and finance the remaining balance with a loan for 5-years at \( $rate  \)$PERCENT compounded monthly through the Tiger's Credit Union.
$PAR
(a) What would Rich's monthly payment be if he takes the 5-year \( 0 \)$PERCENT financing?
$PAR
Monthly payment for 5-year \(0 \)$PERCENT financing = \{ ans_rule(8) \}
$PAR
Hint: The answer is a dollar amount and should include a dollar sign and have exactly two decimals.
$PAR
(b) What would Rich's monthly payment be if he takes the \($rebate\) rebate? 
$PAR
Monthly payment with \($rebate\) rebate = \{ ans_rule(8) \}
$PAR
Hint: The answer is a dollar amount and should include a dollar sign and have exactly two decimals.
$PAR
(c) Which of the two options is financially better for Rich? Enter either "1" (for Option 1) if the \(0  \)$PERCENT financing is better or enter "2" (for Option 2) if the \($rebate\) rebate is better. (Do not include the quotation marks in your answer.)
$PAR
Best Option is Option \{ ans_rule(3) \}
