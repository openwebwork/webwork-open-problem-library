A family purchased a house $time1 years ago for \($house_value\).  They paid \($down $PERCENT\) down, and mortgaged the remainder over 30 years at an annual interest rate \($annual_interest_rate1 $PERCENT\) compounded monthly.  Since then, interest rates have dropped, and the family wants to refinance the unpaid balance of the mortgage by signing a $time2 year mortgage at \($annual_interest_rate2 $PERCENT\) compounded monthly.  How much interest will the family save by refinancing the mortgage?

$PAR
a) Find the monthly payment on the original mortgage: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}

b) Find the unpaid balance of the mortgage after $time1 years: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}

c) How much interest will the family save by refinancing the mortgage? \{ANS_RULE(10)\}

$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
To find the monthly mortgage payment, we use the present value formula
$PAR\[
PV = PMT \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i},
\]$PAR
with \(PV = $house_value\cdot (1 - $downdec) = $mortgage_amt, \text{ }i = \frac{$dec1}{12}, \text{ and }n = 12 \cdot 30\).  Plugging in:
$PAR\[
$mortgage_amt = PM \cdot \frac{1 - \left(1 + \frac{$dec1}{12} \right)^{- 12 \cdot 30}}{\frac{$dec1}{12}},
\]$PAR
and so \(PMT = $answer1\).  
$PAR
To find the unpaid balance on the mortgage after $time2 years, we work backwards.  The unpaid balance after $time1 years can be viewed as the present value of a mortgage with a periodic payment of \(PMT = $answer1\) and having \(30 - $time1 = $time2\) years remaining.  Therefore, to find the unpaid balance after $time1 years, we again use the present value formula:
$PAR\[
PV = $answer1 \cdot \frac{1 - \left(1+ \frac{$dec1}{12} \right)^{-12 \cdot $time2}}{\frac{$dec1}{12}} = $answer2.
\]$PAR
Thus, the unpaid balance after $time1 years is \($answer2\).  Finally, to see how much money they saved by refinancing, we need to find their new payment:
$PAR\[
$answer2 = PMT \frac{1 - \left(1 + \frac{$dec2}{12} \right)^{- 12 \cdot $time2}}{\frac{$dec2}{12}}
\]$PAR
which yields that the new payment is \(PMT = $payment2\).  Thus, their monthly payment was reduced by 
$PAR\[
$answer1 - $payment2 = $reduced.
\]$PAR
This means that they saved a total of
$PAR\[
$reduced \cdot 12 \cdot $time2 = $answer3.
\]$PAR
