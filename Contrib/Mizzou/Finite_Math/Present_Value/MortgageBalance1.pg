BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
To find the monthly mortgage payment, we use the present value formula
$PAR\[
PV = PMT \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i},
\]$PAR
with \(PV = $house_value\cdot (1 - $downdec) = $mortgage_amt, \text{ }i = \frac{$dec}{12}, \text{ and }n = 12 \cdot $time\).  Pluggin in:
$PAR\[
$mortgage_amt = PM \cdot \frac{1 - \left(1 + \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{- 12 \cdot $time}}{\frac{$dec}{12}},
\]$PAR
and so \(PMT = $answer1\).  
$PAR
To find the unpaid balance on the mortgage after $time2 years, we work backwards.  The unpaid balance after $time2 years can be viewed as the present value of a mortgage with a periodic payment of \(PMT = $answer1\) and having \($time - $time2 = $time3\) years remaining.  Therefore, to find the unpaid balance after $time2 years, we again use the present value formula:
$PAR\[
PV = $answer1 \cdot \frac{1 - \left(1+ \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{12 \cdot $time3}}{\frac{$dec}{12}} = $answer2.
\]$PAR
Thus, the unpaid balance after $time2 years is \($answer2\).
