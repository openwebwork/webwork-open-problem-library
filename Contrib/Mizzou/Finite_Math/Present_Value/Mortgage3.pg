BEGIN_TEXT
Fifteen years ago a couple purchased a house for \( $house_value \) by paying a 20 $PERCENT down payment and financing the remaining balance with a 30-year mortgage at \( $rate \)$PERCENT compounded monthly.
$PAR
(a) Find the monthly payment for this loan.
$PAR
Monthly Payment: \{ans_rule(10)\}$BR
[Note: Your answer is a dollar amount and should have a dollar sign and exactly two decimal places.]
$PAR
(b) Find the balance of the loan after \( $years1 \) years and after \( $years2 \) years?
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ begintable(4) \}
\{ row( "After $years1 years", undef,"After $years2 years", undef) \}
\{ row( "\(n=\)", ans_rule(3),"\(n=\)", ans_rule(3)   ) \}
\{ row( "Loan Balance: ", ans_rule(10), "Loan Balance: ", ans_rule(10) ) \}
\{ endtable() \}
$ECENTER
[Note: Your answer for each loan balance should be a dollar amount and should have a dollar sign and exactly two decimal places.]
$PAR
(c) Find the total amount of interest paid by the couple during the \{$years2."th"\} year.
$PAR
Interest Paid During \{$years2."th"\} year: \{ans_rule(10)\}$BR
[Note: Your answer is a dollar amount and should have a dollar sign and exactly two decimal places.]
