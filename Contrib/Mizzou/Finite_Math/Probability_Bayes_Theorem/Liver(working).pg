BEGIN_TEXT
In a random sample of 1,000 people, it is found that $liver$PERCENT have a liver ailment.  Of those who have a liver ailment, $h_liv$PERCENT are heavy drinkers, $m_liv$PERCENT are moderate drinkers, and $n_liv$PERCENT are nondrinkers.  Of those who do not have a liver ailment, $h_n$PERCENT are heavy drinkers, $m_n$PERCENT are moderate drinkers, and $non_n$PERCENT are nondrinkers.
$PAR
If a person is chosen at random, and he or she is a heavy drinker, what is the empirical probability of that person having a liver ailment?
$PAR
\{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
