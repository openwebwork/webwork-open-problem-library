Recall that you will have an unlimited number of attempts to correctly answer a problem. However, $WW has a feature that will create a new version of the problem after it has been incorrectly answered a given number of times. In this way, a student is given an unlimited number of attempts on a problem, but only a finite number of tries for each instance of the problem.

For example, consider the simple addition problem below.  Notice the line ${LQ}You have 3 attempt(s) remaining before you will receive a new version of this problem.${RQ} This will keep you updated on the remaining number of attempts you have left before the problem regenerates. ${BBOLD}Go ahead and answer this problem incorrectly 3 times, by clicking the ${LQ}Submit Answers${RQ} button below, until the correct answer appears below the problem.${EBOLD}

Compute the following sum: \($a + $b = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

Notice that in addition to the correct answer, you also have a ${LQ}Generate a new version of this problem${RQ} button, and you will no longer be able to type into the answer box. All of the problems that you do for your homework will have the same behavior. Now go ahead and hit the ${LQ}Generate a new version of this problem${RQ} button.

A different problem is generated, and you should now see the message ${LQ}You have 3 attempt(s) remaining before you will receive a new version of this problem.${RQ}

At this point you may continue to play around by answering the question incorrectly to familiarize yourself with problem regeneration. After you are done, ${BITALIC}be sure to answer the question correctly in order to receive credit for the problem!${EITALIC}
