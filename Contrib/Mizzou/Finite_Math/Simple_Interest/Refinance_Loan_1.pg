After buying a new car, Jim decides to sell his old car to a friend Mark.  Jim accepts a \($d\) day note for \($p\) at \($i $PERCENT\) exact simple interest as payment (both principal and interest will be paid at the end of \($d\) days).  \($d2\) days later, Jim finds that he needs the money and sells the note to a third party for \($s\).  What annual exact simple interest rate will the third party receive for the investment?

$PAR
\{ANS_RULE(10)\} \( $PERCENT \)

(${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should be correct to two decimal places to be counted as correct.)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
---------------
$BR
${BBOLD} Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
The amount promised after the $d days (including interest) is found by using \(A = P\cdot (1 + rt\).  This amount is:
$PAR \[
A = $p\cdot\left( 1 + $dec \cdot \frac{$d}{365}\right) = $promised_amount.
\] $PAR
Again using \(A = P\cdot ( 1 + rt)\), the third party buys the note for \($s\) and $difference days later is given \($promised_amount\).  Therefore, to find his interest rate, use the same formula and solve for \(r\).
$PAR\[
$promised_amount = $s\cdot\left( 1 + r\cdot \frac{$difference}{365}\right)
\]$PAR
Therefore, \(r = $ansdec\) or \(r = $ans $PERCENT\).
