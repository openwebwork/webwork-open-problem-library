Suppose that an investor purchases \($shares \) shares at \( $purchase_price \) per share; holds the stock for \( $weeks \) weeks, and then sells the stock for \( $sell_price \) per share.  Find the annual rate of interest earned by this investment.  (Express the answer as a percentage, correct to three decimal places.)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Here we will solve for the interest rate \( r \) by applying the simple interest formula
\[ A = P(1 + rt). \]
We know from the information given that \(t = \frac{$weeks}{52}\).  Here, \( P \) is the total amount spent by the investor. This is the amount spent on the stock plus any additional commission.  Since \( $purchase_price \times $shares = $purch_principal \) we use the $purch_row row of the commission table to compute that the commission on the purchase of the stock is \( $purch_commission \).  Therefore, the total amount spent by the investor to purchase the stock is \(P = $net_purchase \).
$PAR
The computation of \( A \) is similar, but in that case we subtract the commission from the proceeds of the stock sale.  Since \[ $sell_price \times $shares = $sell_principal \] we use the $sell_row row of the commission table to compoute tht the commission on the sale of the stock is \($sell_commission \).  Therefore, the total amount received back by the investor after the sale is \( A = $net_sell \).  Then we have
\[ $net_sell = $net_purchase \left ( 1 + r \left ( \frac{$weeks}{52} \right )\right ). \]
Solving for \( r \), we obtain \( r = $interest_rate.\)  Therefore, the answer as a percentage is \( $answer \).  WeBWork will accept this answer correct to three or more decimal places.
