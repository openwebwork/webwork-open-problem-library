Suppose an investor purchases \( $n \) stocks at \($p\) per share, holds for \($w\) weeks and then sells the stocks for $DOLLAR \($a\) per share.  Find the annual simple interest rate earned by this investment.

$PAR
\{ANS_RULE(10)\} \( $PERCENT \)

$BR
${BBOLD} Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR

The cost of the first transaction (not including commission) is 
$PAR\[
$n \cdot $p = $transaction1.
\] $PAR
Thus, the amount of commission charged is 
$PAR \[
$c2 + $i2dec \cdot $transaction1 = $com1,
\] $PAR
and therefore the total cost of the first transaction is
$PAR \[
$transaction1 + $com1 = $cost1.
\] $PAR
Upon selling the stocks, the amount of the transaction (without commission) is given by
$PAR\[
$n * $a = $transaction2.
\]$PAR
Thus, the amount of commission charged is
$PAR\[
$c2 + $i2dec\cdot $transaction 2= $com2,
\]$PAR
and so the total cost of the second transaction is 
$PAR \[
$transaction2 + $com2 = $cost2.
\] $PAR
To find the interest rate earned with this transaction, we use the formula \(A = P(1 + rt\) to see that
$PAR\[
$cost2 = $cost1\cdot(1 + r\cdot \frac{$w}{12}).
\]$PAR
Solving for \(r\) yields \(r = $dec\) or \(r = $ans $PERCENT\).
