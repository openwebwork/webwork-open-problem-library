For services rendered, an attorney accepts a \($days\) day note for \($orig_p \) at \( $rate \)$PERCENT simple interest from a client. (Both interest and principal will be repaid at the end of \($days\) days.)  Wishing to be able to use her money sooner, the attorney sells the note to a third party for \($new_p\) after \($days_2\) days.  What annual interest rate will the third party receive for the investment?  (Enter your answer as a percentage correct to three decimal places.)
$PAR
Annual simple interest rate for third party: \{ ans_rule(6) \}$PERCENT
$BR
Note: Be sure that your answer is correct to three decimal places, and that it is expressed as a percentage (e.g. if the answer is 9.123 $PERCENT  enter  9.123 ) into the answer box.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Step 1: Compute the amount that will be paid at the end of \($days \) days to the holder of the note:

\[ A = P(1 + rt)\]
\[= $orig_p \left [ 1 + \left ( \frac{$rate}{100}\right ) \left ( \frac{$days}{360}\right ) \right ] \]
\[= $amt \]

Step 2: For the third party, we find the annual rate of interest \(r\) required to make \( $new_p \) grow to \( $amt \) in \( $t \) days; that is, we are to find \( r \) (which is to be converted to \(100r  \)$PERCENT ), given \( A = $amt \), \( P = $new_p \) and \( t = \frac{$t}{360} \),
\[ A = P(1 + rt) \]
\[ $amt = $new_p \left[ 1 + r\left ( \frac{$t}{360} \right ) \right ] \]
Solving, we obtain \( r = $answer\)$PERCENT.
