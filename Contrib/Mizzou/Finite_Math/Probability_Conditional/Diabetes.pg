It is estimated that approximately $D$PERCENT Americans are afflicted with diabetes.  Suppose that a certain diagnostic evaluation for diabetes will correctly diagnose $a$PERCENT of all adults over 
\(40\) with diabetes as having the disease and incorrectly diagnoses $b$PERCENT of all adults over \(40\) without diabetes as having the disease.
$PAR
$SPACE $SPACE a) Find the probability that a randomly selected adult over \(40\) does not have diabetes, and is diagnosed as having diabetes (such diagnoses are called "false positives").
$PAR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$BR
$PAR
$SPACE $SPACE b) Find the probability that a randomly selected adult of \(40\) is diagnosed as not having diabetes. 
$PAR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE \{ANS_RULE(10)\}

$SPACE $SPACE c) Find the probability that a randomly selected adult over \(40\) actually has diabetes, given that he/she is diagnosed as not having diabetes (such diagnoses are called "false negatives").  $PAR

(${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD it will be helpful to first draw an appropriate tree diagram modeling the situation)
