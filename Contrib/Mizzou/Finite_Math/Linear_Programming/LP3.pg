An accounting firm has $co4 hours of staff time and $co5 hours of reviewing time
available each week. The firm charges  $DOLLAR$co3  for an audit and 
 $DOLLAR$d  for a tax return. Each audit requires $co1 hours of staff 
time and $co2 hours of review time. Each tax return requires $b hours of 
staff time and $c hours of review time. 
$BR What number of audits and tax 
returns will yield the maximum revenue?
\{ans_rule(5)\} audits and  \{ans_rule(5)\} tax returns
$BR
What is the maximum revenue?

$DOLLAR \{ans_rule(10)\}
