If you make quarterly deposits of \($pmt\) into an ordinary annuity earning an annual interest rate of \( $r  $PERCENT\), how much will be in the account after \( $t \) years?  How much interest did you earn in those \( $t \) years?

$PAR
How much is in the account after \( $t\) years? \{ANS_RULE(10)\} 
$PAR
How much interest was earned after \( $t \) years? \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
(${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer is a dollar amount and should include a dollar sign)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is a simple application of 
\[
FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}
\]
$PAR
where \(PMT = $pmt, \text{ }i = \frac{$dec}{12}, \text{ and } n = 4 \cdot $t = $n\). Plugging everything in, we see that 
$PAR
\[
FV = $ans1.
\]
$PAR
Note that over the \($t\) years, the amount of money deposited into the account is
$BR
\[
$pmt \cdot 4 \cdot $t= $amount_payed.
\]
$PAR
Thus, the amount of interest is
\[
$ans1 - $amount_payed = $ans2.
\]
