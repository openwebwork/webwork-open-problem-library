Bob makes his first \($PMT\) deposit into an IRA earning \($rate \)$PERCENT compounded annually on the day he turns $birthday1 and his last \($PMT\) deposit on the day he turns $birthday2. ($deposits equal deposits in all.)  With no additional deposits, the money in the IRA continues to earn \($rate \)$PERCENT interest compounded annually until Bob retires on his 65th birthday.  How much is the IRA worth when Bob retires?
$PAR
Value of the IRA on Bob's 65th birthday: \{ans_rule(8)\}
$PAR
Hint: The answer is a dollar amount and should include a dollar sign and have exactly two decimals.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The solution has two steps.  First we use the formula
\[ FV = PMT\left[ \frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{i}\right] \]
with \( PMT = $PMT \), \( i = \frac{$rate}{100} \), and \( n = $deposits \) to compute the balance after $deposits years.  This comes to \( $balance1\). We now use the formula 
\[ A = P(1+i)^n \]
with \(P = $balance1\), \(i = \frac{$rate}{100} \), and \(n = $tillretire\).  Notice that we are asked to find the balance on Bob's 65th birthday, so we do not include that year when calculating interest.  His balance when he retires then comes to \($balance2\).
