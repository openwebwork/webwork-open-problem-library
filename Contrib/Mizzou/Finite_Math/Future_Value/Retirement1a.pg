Bob makes his first \($PMT\) deposit into an IRA earning \($rate \)$PERCENT compounded annually on the day he turns $birthday1 and his last \($PMT\) deposit on the day he turns $birthday2 ($deposits equal deposits in all.)  With no additional deposits, the money in the IRA continues to earn \($rate \)$PERCENT interest compounded annually until Bob retires on his 65th birthday.  How much is the IRA worth when Bob retires?
$PAR
Value of the IRA on Bob's 65th birthday: \{ans_rule(20)\}

(${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD The answer is a dollar amount, should include a dollar sign, and should be accurate to two decimal places).
