If you make weekly deposits of \($pmt \) into an ordinary annuity earning \( $r $PERCENT \) compounded weekly, how much money will be in your account after \($t \) years?  How much interest did you earn in your first year?

$PAR 
How much money is in the account after \( $t \) years? \{ANS_RULE(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is a simple application of 
\[
FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i},
\]
$PAR
where \(PMT = $pmt, \text{ }i = \frac{$dec}{52}, \text{ and } n = 52 \cdot $t = $n\). Plugging everything in, we see that 
$PAR
\[
FV = $ans1.
\]
$PAR
To find the interest earned in the first year, we first need to find the amount of money in the account after 1 year.  This is given by
$PAR\[
FV = $pmt \cdot \frac{\left(1 + \frac{$dec}{52} \right)^{52}-1}{\frac{$dec}{52}} = $after1.
\]$PAR
Thus, the interest earned in the first year is given by
$PAR\[
$after1 - 52\cdot $pmt = $ans2.
\]
