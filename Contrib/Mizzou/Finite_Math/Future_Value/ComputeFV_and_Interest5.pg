If you make monthly deposits of \($pmt\) into an ordinary annuity earning annual interest rate of \($r\)$PERCENT compounded monthly, how much will you have in your account after \($t\) years?  How much interest did you earn in the first year?  How much interest did you earn in the \($t\)th year?

$PAR
Amount in the account after \($t\) years:\{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
Interest earned in the first year: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR
Interest earned in the \($t\)th year:\{ANS_RULE(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is a simple application of 
\[
FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i},
\]
$PAR
where \(PMT = $pmt, \text{ }i = \frac{$dec}{12}, \text{ and } n = 12 \cdot $t = $n\). Plugging everything in, we see that after $t years, the amount in the account was:
$PAR
\[
FV = $ans1.
\]
$PAR
To find the interest earned in the first year, we first need to find the amount of money in the account after 1 year.  This is given by
$PAR\[
FV = $pmt \cdot \frac{\left(1 + \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{12}-1}{\frac{$dec}{12}} = $after1.
\]$PAR
Thus, the interest earned in the first year is given by
$PAR\[
$after1 - 12\cdot $pmt = $ans2.
\]
$PAR
Finally, to find the interest earned in the ${t}th year, we need the amount in the account after $t2 years and after $t years.  We already have the amount in the account after $t years (it is \($ans1\)).  The amount in the account after $t2 years is given by:
$PAR
\[
FV = $pmt \cdot \frac{(1 + $i)^{$n2} - 1}{$i} = $aftert2.
\]
$PAR
Therefore, the amount of money added to the account (through both periodic payments and interest) is
$PAR
\[
$ans1 - $aftert2 = $difference.
\]
$PAR
The amount of interest earned in the ${t}th tears is then
$PAR
\[
$difference -  12 \cdot $pmt = $ans3
\]
