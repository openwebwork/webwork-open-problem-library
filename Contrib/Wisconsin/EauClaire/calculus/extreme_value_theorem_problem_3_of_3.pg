BEGIN_PGML

At the end of the previous problem, we saw...

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Extreme Value Theorem*:

If a function [`f`] is continuous on a closed interval [`[a,b]`], then [`f`] has both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum on [`[a,b]`].
[@ closeDiv() @]*

[% Enter the passcode from the previous problem: [_]{$passcode2} %]

So far, we have been finding the absolute maximum and minimum from graphs. How do we find them from an algebraic expression?

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Closed Interval Method");

BEGIN_PGML

[@ openDiv({ "class" => "importantFormula" }) @]*
*Fermat's Theorem*:

If [`(c,f(c))`] is a local maximum or minimum, then either [`f'(c)=0`] or [`f'(c)`] does not exist.
[@ closeDiv() @]*

If [`f'(c)=0`] or [`f'(c)`] does not exist, we call the point [`(c,f(c))`] a _critical point_ (or [`c`] a _critical number_). The absolute maximum of [`f`] on a closed interval [`[a,b]`] can be [`a`], or [`b`], or one of the critical points. Anywhere else, the tangent line would slope up or down, so there would be nearby points both above and below (see "Why is Fermat's Theorem true?" in the previous problem).

If we can find the [`x`]-values for these points, we can plug them in and get the [`y`]-values. One will be the highest, and one will be the lowest!

[% Enter the passcode again: [_]{$passcode2} %]

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Finding critical numbers");

BEGIN_PGML

Let [`f(x)=[$f]`]. Let's find the absolute maximum and minimum of [`f`] on [`[[$x1-1],[$x2+2]]`].

[`f'(x)=`] [_]{$fp}

We need all values of [`c`] such that [`f'(c)=0`] or [`f'(c)`] does not exist. In this case, [`f'(c)`] will always exist, but we can set [`f'(c)=0`]. Type [`f'(c)`] in the box below (same as your previous answer, but replace each [`x`] with [`c`]):

[_]{$fpc} [` =0`]

Now let's factor it! The first box should be a constant, and the others should be [`(c+\mbox{something})`] or [`(c-\mbox{something})`]. (If WebWork won't accept your factors, try swapping the order.)

[_]{6}[`\cdot\Big(`][_]{Formula("c-$x1")}[`\Big)\cdot\Big(`][_]{Formula("c-$x2")}[`\Big)=0`]

Now solve for [`c`]. Enter the lower value first, and the higher one second: [`c=`] [_]{$x1} or [`c=`] [_]{$x2}.

These are our critical numbers!

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Choosing the correct maximum and minimum");

BEGIN_PGML

Recall that the interval is [`[[$left],[$right]]`].

To find the maximum and minimum, we test the critical numbers and the endpoints of the interval. List those four [`x`] values, separated by commas: [_]{List("$left,$x1,$x2,$right")};

Now we evaluate [`f`] at each of these [`x`]-values. Enter the [`x`]-values in increasing order on the left, then enter the correct [`y`]-value in each box on the right.

Enter the [`x`]-value at the left endpoint (the first number in the interval). Then find the [`y`]-value. of the interval:

[`f\Big(`][_]{$left}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y2};

[`f\Big(`][_]{$x1}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y3};

[`f\Big(`][_]{$x2}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y4};

[`f\Big(`][_]{$right}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y5};

The absolute maximum is the highest [`y`]-value: [_]{$y_max}

The absolute maximum is the lowest [`y`]-value: [_]{$y_min}

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Another example");

BEGIN_PGML

Let [`g(x)=x-3([$g_partial])^{\frac23}+[$d]`]. Let's find the absolute maximum and minimum of [`g`] on [`[[$c-1],[$c+1]]`].

[`g'(x)=`] [_]{$gp}

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Zero derivative");

BEGIN_PGML

Now let's solve the equation [`g'(c)=0`]. Fill in [`g'(c)`] in the box. Express it without any negative or fractional exponents (introducing fractions and roots as needed).

[_]{$gpc} [`=0`]

Now solve it for [`c`].

[`c=`] [_]{$c+8}


END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Nonexistent derivative");

BEGIN_PGML

But we also need the values where [`g'(c)`] does not exist. In this case, that will happen when [`\sqrt[3]{[$g_partial_c]}=0`]. Solve this for [`c`].

[`c=`] [_]{$c}

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Finishing the job");

BEGIN_PGML

Recall that the interval is [`[[$c-1],[$c+1]]`].

List the four [`x`] values that are either a critical number or an endpoint (separated by commas): [_]{List("$c-1,$c,$c+1,$c+8")}

You may have noticed that one of these numbers is outside the interval. We don't need to worry about that one! List the other three: [_]{List("$c-1,$c,$c+1")}

Now we evaluate [`g`] at each of these [`x`]-values (in increasing order), as before.

[`g\Big(`][_]{$c-1}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y6};

[`g\Big(`][_]{$c}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y7};

[`g\Big(`][_]{$c+1}[`\Big)=`] [_]{$y8};

The absolute maximum is the highest [`y`]-value: [_]{$ymax}

The absolute maximum is the lowest [`y`]-value: [_]{$ymin}
