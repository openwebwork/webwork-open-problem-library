Suppose that you have two consumption choices: good X, and good Y.  An indifference curve is the set of consumption choices with a CONSTANT utility.  For example if \(X=10\) and \(Y=6\) gives the same utility as consuming \(X=11\) and \(Y=5\), than these are both points on the same indifference curve.  An indifference map is the set of all indifference curves for EVERY given utility.  
$PAR
Consider the following utility map:
$BR \(U = \ln(X-$a)+\ln(Y-$b)\)

$PAR  A budget curve gives the set of possible consumption choices with a given income.  If you have an income of $$i and the price of good X is given by \(p_x\), and the price of good Y given by \(p_y\).  The equation for the budget line is given by: \($i = p_x X + p_y Y\).

$PAR
A utility maximizing combination of goods X and Y occurs when the budget line is tangent to an indifference curve.  

$PAR
Find X as a function of its price and the price of good Y:
$BR (If Y represents all other goods, than this function is just a demand curve for X).

$PAR \(X = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR (Use px for \(p_x\) and py for \(p_y\))


$PAR Let \(X_0\) be the value for X when \(p_x = $px\) and \(p_y = $py\).
$BR \(X_0 = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

       $PAR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD To find the point where the curves are tangent to each other, you need to find a point where both their slopes and coordinates are equal. To find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) you will need to use the rules of implicit differentiation and the fact that \(\frac{dU}{dx} = 0\). You will then have two equations.  Manipulate these equations to isolate X as a function \(p_x\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Using the rules of implicit differentiation we get:
$BR \(\frac{dU}{dx} = \frac{1}{x-$a}+\frac{1}{y-$b}\frac{dY}{dX}\)

$PAR Since utility is constant at all points on a utility curve: \(\frac{dU}{dX} = 0\).
$BR Therefore, after some algebra we find: \(\frac{dY}{dX} = \frac{Y-$b}{X-$a}\).

$PAR 
Now we can rearrange the budget function to get:
$BR \(Y = \frac{$i-p_x X}{p_y}\) 
$PAR \(\frac{dY}{dX} = -\frac{p_x}{p_y}\).


$PAR
For an indifference curve to be tangent to the budget function their slopes have to be equal:
$PAR  \(\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{Y-$b}{X-$a}\)
$PAR \(Y = \frac{p_x}{p_y}(X-$a)+$b\)

$PAR We now need to find for what value of X does this occur on the budget function:
$BR \(\frac{$i-X p_x}{p_y} =  \frac{p_x}{p_y}(X-$a)+$b\)
$PAR \( $i - X p_x = p_x(X-$a) + $b p_y\)
$BR \(2X p_x = $i-$b p_y + $a p_x\)
$BR \(X = \frac{$i-$b p_y}{2 p_x} + $a2\)

$PAR Therefore:
$BR \(X_0 = $x\)
