BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We have to look for the point where the additional cost of producing an extra fan is equal to the market price of the fan.

By inspection we can see that producing the 7th fan costs an additional $11, but the 8th fan costs an additional $13.  Since the market price for fans is $12, the profit maximizing level of production is 7 fans
