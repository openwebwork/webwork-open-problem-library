In this question you will derive a simple Laffer curve, which relates tax revenue to the tax rate.  

$PAR

Consider two simple labour supply and labour demand curves:
$BR Demand: \(w = b - c L\)
$BR Supply: \(w = a L\)
$BR Where \(w\) is wage, \(L\) is the quantity supplied or demanded of labour, and \(a,b,c\) are some constants.

$PAR If \(r\) is the tax rate (so if the income tax rate is 25% then r=.25) then:
$BR \(w_1 = \frac{1}{1-r}aL\)
$BR Where \(w_1\) corresponds to the labour supply curve under the income tax.  So a worker will receive \(w_1\) but will have to pay  \(w_1 - w\) to the government in the form of income tax. 

$PAR
If \(w^*_1\) and \(L^*\) are the equilibrium wage and quantity of labour supplied with an income tax (ei. quantity demanded equals quantity supplied), and \(w^* = w(L^*)\), then the total tax is: \(TAX = (w^*_1 - w^*)L^*\).

$PAR To simplify the analysis we can choose the units of the quantity of labour and the wage so that \(a,b,c=1\).

$PAR Find the tax rate as a function of \(r\)
$BR \(TAX = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR Find the revenue maximizing tax rate (\(r^*\)):
$BR \(r^* = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
You can simplify your solution a little by setting \(m=\frac{1}{1-r}\).

$PAR You can do this because if \(TAX = T(m)\), then \(\frac{dT}{dr} = \frac{dT}{dm}\frac{dm}{dr}\).  Since we are looking for \(\frac{dT}{dr}=0\), it follows that finding \(\frac{dT}{dm} = 0\), will yield the same answer so long as \(\frac{dm}{dr} \ne 0\).

$PAR
First find the equilibrium level of quantity of labour given the supply curve with the income tax:
$BR \(m L = 1- cL\) (I have left c as a constant because it has an interesting interpretation)
$BR \(L = \frac{1}{m+c}\)

$PAR
Now find the equilibrium wages:
$BR \(w_1 = \frac{m}{m+c}\)
$BR \(w = \frac{1}{m+c}\)

$PAR 
The tax revenue is \(TAX = (w_1-w)L\),
$BR \(T(m) = \frac{m-1}{m+c}\),
$BR Subbing in for r and letting \(c=1\):
$BR \(T(r) = \frac{r(r-1)}{(2-r)^2}\). 
$BR This is the Laffer Curve for this scenario.

$PAR 
\(\frac{dT}{dm} = \frac{(m+c)^2-2(m-1)(m+c)}{(m+c)^4}\)
$PAR \(0 = m+c - 2(m-1)\)
$BR \(m = c+2\),

$PAR Since \(m = \frac{1}{1-r}\),
$BR \(r^* = 1 - \frac{1}{m}\)
$BR \( r^* = 1 - \frac{1}{c+2}\)
$BR \(r^* = \frac{2}{3}\)

$PAR Therefore the revenue maximizing tax rate is about 67%.

$PAR INTERPRETATION:
$BR Notice how as c goes up so does \(r^*\).  c is related to the wage elasticity of demand for labour.  Specifically, a  way to express the elasticity (E) is: \(\frac{dw}{dL} E = \frac{w}{L}\).  Since \(c = \frac{dw}{dL}\) for the labour demand curve, the bigger c is, the more inelastic the demand for labour.  Therefore, in this example, the more inelastic the supply for labour, the higher the the revenue maximizing tax rate will be.
