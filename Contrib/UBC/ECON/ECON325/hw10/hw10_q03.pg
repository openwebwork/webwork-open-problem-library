###Random number generator seed based on student's login. No need to change.

It is hypothesized that the market share of a corporation should vary
more in an industry with active price competition than in one with duopoly
and tacit collusion. Suppose that in a study of the steam turbine generator
industry, it was found that in 4 years of active price competition, the
variance of General Electric's market share was $v1[0]. In the
following 7 years, in which there was duopoly and tacit collusion, this
variance was $v2[0]. Assume that the data can be regarded as an
independent random sample from two normal distributions. Test the null
hypothesis that the two population variances are equal against the
alternative that the variance of market share is higher in years of active
price competition. Answer the following, rounding off your answers to two
decimal places.

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(a) $EBOLD 
What is the test statistic?  \{  ans_rule(7) \} 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(b) $EBOLD  
With a 5 % significance level, what is the critical value? \{  ans_rule(7) \} 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(c) $EBOLD  What is the p-value for the test? \{  ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(d) $EBOLD 
 \{ $mc_e->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc_e->print_a() \}
$BR
To make a decision, two approaches can be used: compare the test statistic
with the critical value or interpret the p-value. You can check that both
approaches give the same conclusion.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
Solution: The test for equality of variances of two normal
distributions has as test statistic
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
F=\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
where \(s_{1}^{2} \) and \(s_{2}^{2} \) are the sample
variances. If we have samples of size \(n_{1}\)  and  \(n_{2},\)
we compare the ratio \(s_{1}^{2}/ s_{2}^{2} \) and compare this
with the F distribution on \( n_{1}-1\) and \( n_{2}-1\) degrees of freedom. Specifically 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\sim F_{\left( n_{1}-1\right) ,\left(
n_{2}-1\right) }
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
when \( H_{0}:\sigma _{1}^{2}=\sigma _{2}^{2} \) is true.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD
The test statistic is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}=\frac{$v1[0]}{$v2[0]}=$q1[0]. 
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD
In this case we compare 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}=\frac{$v1[0]}{$v2[0]}=$q1[0]
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
with the \(F_{3,6}\) distribution. This is a one-tailed test (the
alternative hypothesis is \( H_{a}:\sigma _{1}^{2}>\sigma _{2}^{2},\) 
consistent with the suggestion that prices will vary more in a market with
price competition), so we seek the upper 95% point on the \(
F_{3,6} \) distribution if testing at 5% significance level. This
value is (via tables or software) 4.757.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD
The p-value is the probability of observing a value of the test
statistic greater than the one observed (and so more consistent with \(H_{a}\)) when \(H_{0}\) holds. This is $q3[0].  
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (d) $EBOLD
If our test statistic is less than 4.757, we would not reject the
null hypothesis. Otherwise, we must reject at the 5 % significance level.
