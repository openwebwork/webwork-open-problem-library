## Main Text: where all text goes (Required)

BEGIN_TEXT
A publisher is interested in the effects on sales of college texts of
expensive three-colour cover designs. The publisher is planning to bring out
20 texts in the business area and randomly chooses 10 of them to have
expensive cover designs. The remaining 10 are produced with plain covers.
For those with expensive cover designs, first-year sales averaged $ $m1[0] and the sample standard deviation was $ $s1[0]. For the books with
plain cover designs, first-year sales averaged $ $m2[0] and the sample
standard deviation was $ $s2[0].

Assuming that the two population distributions are normal with the
same variance, test the null hypothesis that the population means are equal

expensive cover designs. Use a 5% significance level. Answer the following,

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD We have samples of size 10 from each of two normal distributions,
and interest resides in testing for equality of means. In particular, we
test \( H_{0}:\mu _{1}=\mu _{2} \) against \( H_{1}:\mu _{1} > \mu _{2},\)
where \( \mu _{1}\) is the mean first-year sales (in $) for books with the plainer covers. 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (i) $EBOLD
Now as the sample sizes are equal, the pooled estimate of the (assumed
common) population standard deviation is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
s_{p} &=\sqrt{\frac{$s1[0]^{2}+$s2[0]^{2}}{2}}=$q1[0]. 
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (ii) $EBOLD
With the two sample means denoted \(\bar{x}_{1}\) and  \(\bar{x
}_{2},\) the (absolute value of the) test statistic is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
 t &= \frac{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}{\sqrt{
\frac{2s_{p}^{2}}{10}}} =
 \frac{$m1[0]-$m2[0]}{\sqrt{
\frac{$s1[0]^{2}+$s2[0]^{2}}{10}}} = $q2[0]. 
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (iii) $EBOLD
Given the one-sided alternative hypothesis, we would reject \( H_{0} \) at the 5% significance level when the test statistic is greater than the 95-percent point of the t distribution with \(10+10-2=18\) degrees of freedom. This critical value is 1.734.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (iv) $EBOLD
If \(t>1.734\) we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we
do not reject \( H_{0} \) at the 5% significance level.
$BR
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD
The test for equality of variances of two normal
distributions has a test statistic
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
F=\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
where \(s_{1}^{2} \) and \(s_{2}^{2} \) are the sample
variances. If we have samples of size \(n_{1}\)  and  \(n_{2},\)
we compare the ratio \(s_{1}^{2}/ s_{2}^{2} \) and compare this
with the F distribution on \( n_{1}-1\) and \( n_{2}-1\) degrees of freedom. Specifically 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\sim F_{\left( n_{1}-1\right) ,\left(
n_{2}-1\right) }
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
when \( H_{0}:\sigma _{1}^{2}=\sigma _{2}^{2} \) is true.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (i) $EBOLD 
In this case we compare 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}=\frac{$s1[0]^2}{$s2[0]^2}=$q4[0] 
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
with the \( F_{9,9} \) distribution. Naturally this is a two-tailed
test (it doesn't matter which estimate divides which), we seek the upper and
lower 5% points on the \( F_{9,9}\) distribution if testing at 10% significance level. 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (ii) $EBOLD 

Now \( F_{9,9} \left( 0.05\right) = 0.3146 \)  and \( F_{9,9}\left( 0.95\right) = 3.1789\). If \( s_{1}^{2}/s_{2}^{2}\) falls between these values, we do not reject \(H_{0}\) at the
10% significance level. Alternatively and equivalently, we may reject \(
H_{0}\) at the 10% level if the maximum of \(s_{1}^{2}/s_{2}^{2}\) and
\( s_{2}^{2} / s_{1}^{2}\) is greater than \(F_{9,9}\left( 0.9\right) = 2.4403.\)
$BR
$BR
In fact this test requires the normality assumption to be a reasonable
one. If the distributions from which the data are taken are not normal, the
critical region tends to become too large and as a consequence too many type
I errors occur.
