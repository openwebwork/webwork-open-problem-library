A computer software company has submitted bids on two separate government contracts, A and B. The company estimates that it has a @xx[0] percent chance of winning contract A and a @yy[0] percent chance of winning contract B. The company believes that winning contract A is independent of winning contract B. Answer the following questions, rounding your answers to two decimal places where appropriate.

$BBOLD(a) $EBOLD What is the probability that the company will win both contracts?

the two contracts? \{ans_rule(7) \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Define the events A = {Company wins contract A} and
B = {Company wins contract B}. Initially these events are assumed independent. 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The event is the intersection of A and B; and if independent
this has probability \( P(A) \times P(B) = @x[0] \times @y[0] =@q1[0] \). 
$BR  
$BR
$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The event is question is the union of A and B, having probability \( P(A) + P(B) -P(A~\text{and}~B) = @x[0] + @y[0] -@x[0] \times @y[0] =@q2[0] \).  
$BR  
$BR
$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD It is now assumed that the events A and B are not independent, with the event A given B (denoted {A|B}) having probability @z[0]. The probability of A and B is therefore \( P(A~\text{and}~B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)= @z[0] \times @y[0]  =@q3[0] \). 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (d) $EBOLD The event is question is the union of A and B, now having
probability \( P(A) + P(B) -P(A~\text{and}~B) = @x[0] + @y[0] -@z[0] \times @y[0] =@q4[0] \).
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (e) $EBOLD We know that given contract B is won, the probability of winning contract A is @z[0]. Therefore, given that contract B is won, the probability of not winning contract A must be 1-@z[0]= @q5[0].
