## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects (Required)


###Random number generator seed based on student's login. No need to change.
Context("Numeric");

my $hash = crypt($studentLogin, 'a1');
# warn("crypt: $hash");

my $seed = 0;
$seed = $seed * 62 + $nums{$_} foreach split(//, substr($hash, -5, 5));
##warn("seed: " . $seed);

####Call R server
rserve_eval("set.seed($seed)"); ## can not combine with the rest

@p1=rserve_eval('

$mc1 = new_multiple_choice( );

$mc1 -> extra("No");

###
$mc2 = new_multiple_choice( );

####Build table

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The probability of A is found by summing the probabilities of
the disjoint events that comprise A. We see that A is the union of {Return between 10% and 20%} and {Return > 20%}. Adding the corresponding probabilities we find
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\( 
p(A)=@p4[0]+@p5[0]
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR   

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The probability of B is found by summing the probabilities of
the disjoint events that comprise B: We see that B is the union of {Return between 0% and 10%} and {Return <10%}. Adding the corresponding probabilities we find 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\( 
p(B)=@p1[0]+@p2[0]
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD The complement of an event A is the event that A does not occur. We find the probability of the complement of an event A by subtracting from unity the probability of the event A: In this case, we have \(1-(@p4[0]+@p5[0]). \)
$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (d) $EBOLD As events A and B are disjoint, they cannot both occur so the probability of their intersection is 0.

$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (e) $EBOLD As events A and B are disjoint, the probability of their union is
the sum of their probabilities, this being \( @p1[0]+@p2[0]+@p4[0]+@p5[0] \). 

$BR
$BR 
$BBOLD (f) $EBOLD Since A occurring precludes B from occurring, and vice versa, the two events are mutually exclusive.

$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (g) $EBOLD Events are exhaustive when their union is the sample space. Since there is a possibility that the return rate is between 0% and 10%, events
A and B are not exhaustive.
