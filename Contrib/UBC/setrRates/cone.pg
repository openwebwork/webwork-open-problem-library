An inverted conical water tank with a height of \($h\) meters and a radius of \($r\) meters is drained through a hole in the vertex at a rate of \($dV\) meters cubed per second.  What is the rate of change of the water depth when the water depth is \($h0\) meters?
$BR $BBOLD Remember: $EBOLD The volume of a cone is \(\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\).

$PAR

\(\left.\frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h=$h0} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Use similar triangles to show that the ratio of the height to the radius will stay constant at \($c\). So \(\frac{h}{r} = $c\), and \(r=\frac{h}{$c}\)

$PAR\(V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\)
$BR \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (\frac{h}{$c})^2 h\)
$BR \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \frac{1}{$c^2} h^3\)

$PAR \(\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi \frac{1}{$c2} h^2\frac{dh}{dt}\)

$PAR \(\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{dV}{dt}\frac{$c2}{ h^2 \pi}\)
$BR \(=\frac{$dV ($c2)}{$h20 \pi}\)
$BR \(=\frac{$c2}{ \pi}\)
