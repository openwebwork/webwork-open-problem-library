BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that you have five consumption choices: good \(x_1 \cdots x_5\).  An indifference surface is the set of consumption choices with a CONSTANT utility.  For example if \( (x_1, \cdots,x_5) = (2,1,1,1,1) \) gives the same utility as \( (x_1, \cdots, x_5) = (1,1,1,1,2) \) than these are both points on the same indifference surface.  An indifference map is the set of all indifference surface for EVERY given utility.  
$PAR
Consider the following utility map:
$BR \(\displaystyle U = \sum_{i=1}^{5}{\ln({x_i - a_i}) }\)
$BR Where \( (a_1, \cdots, a_5) = ($a1,$a2,$a3,$a4,$a5)\)

$PAR  The budget constraint gives the set of possible consumption choices with a given income.  If you have an income of $$i and the price of good \(x_i\) is given by \(p_i\). The equation for the budget line is given by: \(\displaystyle $i = \sum_{i=1}^{5}{p_i x_i}\).

$PAR
A utility maximizing combination of goods \(x_1 \cdots x_5\) occurs when the surface given by the budget constraint is tangent to an indifference surface.


$PAR
Find \(x_1\) as a function of \(p_1 \cdots p_5\)

$PAR \(x_1 = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR (Use p1 for \(p_1\) and likewise for \(p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5\).

$PAR The easiest way to solve this question is using Lagrange multiplier.
$BR We define the Lagrange function to be:
$BR \(\displaystyle \Lambda(x_1,\cdots,x_5,\lambda) = U(x_1,\cdots,x_5) -\lambda\left(\sum_{i=1}^{5}{p_i x_i} - $i\right)\)

$PAR Utility is maximized when all of the partial derivatives of the Lagrange function are equal to \(0\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

\(\displaystyle \Lambda(x_1,\cdots,x_5,\lambda) = U(x_1,\cdots,x_5) -\lambda\left(\sum_{i=1}^{5}{p_i x_i} - $i\right)\),

$PAR 

\(\displaystyle \frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i} - \lambda p_i\)
$BR \(\displaystyle 0 = \frac{1}{x_i-a_i} - \lambda p_i\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{\lambda} = p_i\frac{1}{x_i-a_i}\)

$PAR Similarly
$BR \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{\lambda} = p_i\frac{1}{x_j-a_j}\)

$PAR
\(\displaystyle p_i (x_j-a_j) = p_i(x_i-a_i)\)
$BR \(\displaystyle p_j x_j = p_i x_i - p_i a_i + p_j a_j \)
$BR \(\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{5}{p_j x_j} = p_i x_i - p_i a_i +\sum_{j=1}^{5}{p_j a_j}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle $i =  p_i x_i +\sum_{j=1,j \ne i}^{5}{p_j a_j}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle x_i = \left($i -\sum_{j=1,j \ne i}^{5}{p_j a_j}\right)\frac{1}{p_i}\)

$PAR Therefore:
$BR \(\displaystyle x_1 = \frac{$i- $a2 p_2 - $a3 p_3 - $a4 p_4-$a5 p_5}{p_1}\)

$PAR
An Economic Interpretation of the Lagrange Multiplier:
$BR
\(\displaystyle \frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i} - \lambda p_i\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \lambda = \frac{1}{p_i} \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}\)

$PAR Therefore \(\lambda\) is the marginal utility of a good divided by the price of that good, and is constant across all goods.  

$PAR In introductory economics class you learn that when an individual maximizes their utility, the marginal utility per price will be constant across all goods that they consume. Now you have a mathematical reason for why this must be the case.
