Suppose that all you do in a day is work, play and sleep.  Let \(x_1\) be the number of hours per day you spend playing, \(x_2\) is the number of hours you spend sleeping, and \(x_3\) is the number of hours you spend working.  Suppose that sleeping is free, but playing costs you $$p1 an hour.  Furthermore, you spend all the money you earn working on playing.

$PAR The utility you get from sleeping and playing is given by a Cobb-Douglas utility function:
$BR \( U = x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2}\), where \(a_1 + a_2 = 1\)

$PAR $BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD By construction, \(x_2\) can represent the hours you spend consuming anything that is free, and \(x_1\) can be the number of hours consuming goods you have to pay for.  This does not change the question, it is just interesting that this set-up can be applied to a more general setting.

$PAR Let \(a_1 = \frac{$an}{$ad}\)
$BR If your hourly wage is \(w\). Find the number of hours you should work a day \((x_3^*)\) in order to maximize your utility as a function of \(w\).

$BR \(x_3^* = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
If \(w = $w\):
$BR \(x_3^* = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}



$PAR The easiest way to solve this question is using Lagrange multipliers.
$BR In general: suppose you want to maximize \(f(x_1,x_2,x_3)\), subject to \(h(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0\), and \(g(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0\).

$BR We define the Lagrange function to be:
$BR \(\displaystyle \Lambda(x_1,x_2,x_3,\lambda_1,\lambda_2) = f(x_1,x_2,x_3) -\lambda_1 g(x_1,x_2,x_3) - \lambda_2 h(x_1,x_2,x_3)\)

$PAR \(f(x_1,x_2,x_3)\) is maximized when all of the partial derivatives of the Lagrange function are equal to \(0\).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

There is only 24 hours in a day so we know \(x_1+x_2+x_3 = 24\).  We also know that all the money you earn working will be spent playing, so: \(w x_3 = $p1 x_1\).  From the Lagrenge Function, let \(g(x_1,x_2,x_3) = x_1+x_2+x_3 - 24\), and \(h(x_1,x_2,x_3) = $p1 x_1 - w x_3\). 

$PAR We can simplify the algebra by looking at \(\ln{U}\) instead of \(U\).
$BR \(\ln{U} = a_1\ln{x_1} + a_2\ln{x_2}\)

$PAR We can now define the Lagrenge Function as:
$BR $BR \(\displaystyle \Lambda(x_1,x_2,x_3,\lambda_1,\lambda_2) = a_1\ln{x_1} + a_2\ln{x_2}  -\lambda_1 (x_1+x_2+x_3-24) - \lambda_2 ($p1 x_1 - w x_3)\)

$PAR Finding all the partial derivatives of \(\Lambda\) and setting them equal to 0, we have the following equations:

$PAR
\(w x_3 = x_1 p_1\), $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE \(\displaystyle x_3 = \frac{$p1 x_1}{w}\)
$BR \(24 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3\), $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE \(\displaystyle x_2 = \frac{24w-x_1($p1 + w)}{w}\)
$BR \(\frac{a_1}{x_1} = $p1 \lambda_1 + \lambda_2\)
$BR \( \lambda_2 = \frac{a_2}{x_2}\)
$BR \(\lambda_2 = w\lambda_1\)

$PAR
You can easily solve for \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \lambda_1 = \frac{a_2}{w x_2}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \lambda_2 = \frac{a_2}{x_2}\)

$PAR Now plug back into \(\frac{a_1}{x_1} = $p1 \lambda_1 + \lambda_2\):
$BR \(\displaystyle \frac{a_1}{x_1} =  \frac{$p1 a_2}{w x_2} + \frac{a_2}{x_2}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \frac{a_1}{x_1} = \frac{a_2($p1+w)}{w x_2}\)

$PAR Plugging in for \(x_2\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \frac{a_1}{x_1} = \frac{a_2($p1+w)}{24w-x_1($p1+w)}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle 24 a_1 w - a_1 x_1($p1+w) = x_1 a_2($p1+w)\)
$BR \(\displaystyle x_1($p1 + w)(a_1+a_2) = 24 a_1 w\)
$BR \(\displaystyle x_1 = \frac{24 a_1 w}{$p1+w}\)

$PAR Therefore:
$BR \(\displaystyle x_3^* = \frac{24 a_1 ($p1)}{$p1+w}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle x_3^* = \frac{$ansHelp}{$p1+w}\)

$PAR NOTE: It is interesting that in this scenario, the number of hours you work in a week is a decreasing function of your hourly wage.  Economically this means that your labour supply curve is downward sloping.

$PAR When \(w = $w\)
$BR \(x_3^* = $x3\) 

$PAR Therefore, you should work $x3 hours a day.
