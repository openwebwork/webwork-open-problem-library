BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you want to start saving for retirement.  You decide to continuously invest $$inv of your income each year in a risk-free investment with a $rate% yearly interest rate, compounded continuously.

$PAR
If \(y\) is the value of the investment, and \(t\) is in years:
$BR \(\frac{dy}{dt} = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR Your answer should be in terms of \(y\).

$PAR
You start investing at \(t=0\) so \(y(0)=$init\).
$BR \(y(t) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
What is the size of your investment after $years years.
$BR \(y($years) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

\(\frac{dy}{dt} = $r y+$inv\)

$PAR \( \frac{dy}{dt} - $r y = $inv \)

$BR \(\displaystyle e^{-$r t}\frac{dy}{dt} - $r y e^{-$r t} = $inv e^{-$r t}\) , multipling both sides by \(e^{-$r t}\)
$BR \(\displaystyle \left(y e^{-$r t}\right)' = $inv e^{-$r t}\), this step utilizes the product rule
$BR \(\displaystyle y e^{-$r t} = \int \! $inv e^{-$r t} \, dt\)
$BR \(\displaystyle y e^{-$r t} = -$a e^{-$r t} + C\)
$BR \(\displaystyle y = C e^{$r t} -$a\)
$PAR Since \(y(0) = $init\)
$BR \($init = C - $a\)
$BR \(C = $c\)

$PAR Therefore \(y = $c e^{$r t} -$a\)

$PAR The value of the investment after $years years is $$ans3.
