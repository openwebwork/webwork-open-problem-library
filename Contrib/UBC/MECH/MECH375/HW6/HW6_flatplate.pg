$PAR
Hot blocks of steel enter a dye to form thinner plates. The plates are then exposed to air to cool down.
One of these plates is $L-m wide and is at \(T=$T1^\circ\)C.  The sorrounding air has speed of \(U=$U\) m/s and temperature of
\(T_{air}=$T2^\circ\)C.  
$PAR
a) What is a reasonable temperature at which the properties of air shall be read?  \{ans_rule(10)\}\(^\circ\)C. $BR
$PAR
b) Read the properties of air at the temperature above and compute Reynolds number. \(Re=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
$PAR
c) Is the flow laminar, turbulent or mixed? \{ $C->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
d) Based on the flow regime, find an appropriate correlation and compute averaged Nusselt number \(Nu=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
$PAR
e) Compute convection heat transfer coefficient. \(h=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\).K $BR
$PAR
f) Evaluate the rate of convection heat transfer per unit length of the plate \(q=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}  W/m. $BR
$PAR
g) Do you think we should take into account the heat transfer by radition?\{ $G->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
h) The flow velocity is increased to $U2 m/s. Is the new flow laminar, turbulent or mixed? \{ $H->menu() \} $BR

### SOLUTION
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
a) 
\(  T_{film} = \frac{T_s + T_{\infty}}{2} = \frac{$T1 + $T2}{2} = $Tf \)
$PAR
b) Properties of air at \(T_{film}\) are as follows:
$PAR
\(\rho = $rho \) kg/m\(^{3}\), 
\(\nu = $nu \) m\(^{2}\).s,  
\(\mu =  2.3\times 10^{-5}\) Pa.s, 
\(k = $k\) W/m.K, \(Pr = $Pr \)
$PAR
\[ Re = \frac{\rho U D}{\mu } =\frac{U L}{\nu }= \frac{($U)($L)}{$nu} = $ReL  \] 
$PAR
c) Because \(Re < 50000\), then flow is laminar.
$PAR
d) \(  Nu = 0.664 Re^\frac{1}{2} Pr^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.644($ReL)^\frac{1}{2}($Pr)^\frac{1}{3} = $NuL \)
$PAR
e) \( h = \frac{Nu k}{L} = ($NuL)($k)/$L = $h   \) W/m\(^2\).K
$PAR
f) \( q = h L (T - T_{\infty} ) = ($h)($T1-$T2)($L) = $q \) W/L 
$PAR
g) Yes 
$PAR
h) \(Re_{new}  = ($U2)($L)/$nu = $ReL2  \), therefore the flow is mixed 
$PAR
i) 
\(  Nu_{new} = \left(0.037 Re^\frac{4}{5} -871\right) Pr^\frac{1}{3} =\left(0.037($ReL2^\frac{4}{5})-871\right)($Pr^\frac{1}{3}) = $NuL2 \)
$PAR
\( h = \frac{Nu k}{L} = ($NuL2)($k)/$L = $h2   \) W/m\(^2\).K
$PAR
\( q_{new} = h L (T - T_{\infty} ) = ($h2)($T1-$T2)($L) = $q2     \)
