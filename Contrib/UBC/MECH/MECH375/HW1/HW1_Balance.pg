$PAR
Surface of a mechanical device is supplied with power \(q''=\) $q kW/m\(^2\) in a room with air temperature of \(T_{air} =\) $T1 \(^\circ\)C. To avoid mecanical malfunction, the surface temperature should not exceed $T2 \(^\circ\)C. Assuring the surface emissivity is \(\varepsilon=\) $eps, 
$PAR
a) compute the heat transfer per unit area due to radiation when the surface is at the critical temperature $BR
$PAR
\(q''_{rad}\)= \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\)
$PAR

b) determine the minimum heat transfer coefficient necessary for this application. $BR

$PAR
\(h_{min}\)= \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\).K
$PAR

Given the value of heat transfer coefficient, do you think we require a fan for this application?  \{ $yesno->menu() \}  $BR

$PAR
Boltzmann constant is \(\sigma = 5.67\times 10^{-8} \) W/m\(^2\).K\(^4\)

### SOLUTION
BEGIN_SOLUTION

a) \(q''_{rad} = \epsilon \sigma \left(T_s^4 - T_{sur}^4\right)= 
$eps \times (5.67\times 10^{-8}) \left(($T1+273)^4 -($T2+273)^4\right)= $qr \) W/m\(^2\).

$PAR
b) \( q'' = q''_{rad} + q''_{conv} \Rightarrow h\Delta T + q''_{rad} = q'' \Rightarrow h = \frac{q''-q''_{rad}}{\Delta T}\)
$PAR $BR 
\( h = \frac{$q\times 1000 -$qr}{$T2-$T1} = \) $h W/m\(^2\).K
$PAR $BR 
Since the required value of the convection coefficient is rather small, we most likely do not need a fan.
