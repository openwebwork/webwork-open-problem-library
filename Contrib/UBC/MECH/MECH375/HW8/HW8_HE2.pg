A heat exchanger as shown above with two shell passes and four tube passes is used for condensing steam in a small powerplant. Saturated steam at temperature $T1\(^\circ\)C is on the shell side, while cooling water is pumped inside the tube. Steam flow rate is $mdot1 kg/s and water flow rate is $mdot2 kg/s. The temperature of the cooling water at the entrance is $T2 \(^\circ\)C. The overal surface area of the HE is $A m\(^2\). 

$PAR
$BBOLD Assumptions $EBOLD
$PAR
For the sake of simplicity assume the water and steam properties are constant and given by
$PAR
Water: \(c_p =$cp2\) J/kg.K
$PAR
Steam: \(h_{fg} = $hfg \times 10^6\) J/kg. (\(h_{fg}\) is the latent heat of condensation. It is the heat that needs to be removed from 1 kg of saturated steam to condense to saturated water. ) 

$PAR
Also assume the heat exchanger is well insulated and no heat can escape the shell.

$PAR
a) Based on the definition of \(h_{fg} \) given above, what rate of heat that is removed from the steam? (This is as simplie as a multiplication). \(q=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W $BR
$PAR
b) Use the heat rate found above to find the exit temperature of water. \(T_{o,water} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C  $BR
$PAR
c) While condensing, steam releases heat but its temperature remains constant. That means heat capacity of a condensing steam is  \{ $C1->menu() \}.
As a result,  \{ $C2->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
d) Using the conclusions made above,  \(R= C_{min}/C_{max} = \)  \{ans_rule(10)\}  and \(\varepsilon=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$PAR
e) Use an appropriate correlation to   \(NTU =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}. $BR
$PAR
f) Calculate the overal heat transfer coefficient \(U =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\).K. $BR
$PAR

After several years of operation, due to fouling factor, \(\varepsilon\) is reduced to $EPSfoul. Assume that the inlet and outlet temperatures as well as water flow rate
 remain unchanged. 
 
h) Find the rate of steam condensation based on the new value of  \(\varepsilon\). \(\dot{m}_{steam}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}  $BR
$PAR
i) Repeat the steps above to find the overal heat transfer coefficient \(U_{f} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\).K. $BR
$PAR
j) Use part i and f to estimate the resistance due to the fouling factor for the heat exchanger. \(R_{f} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} K/W. $BR
