BEGIN_TEXT
An ideal gas at \(P_1=$P1\) \(kPa\) and \(T_1=$T1^{\circ}C\) enters a steady-flow
compressor. The gas is compressed to \($P2\) \(kPa\), and \(10%\)
of the mass that entered the compressor is removed for some
other use. The remaining \(90%\)  of the inlet gas is compressed
to \(P_3=$P3\) \(kPa \) before leaving the compressor. The entire
compression process is assumed to be reversible and adiabatic.
The power supplied to the compressor is measured to be \(W=$W\)
\(kW\). If the ideal gas has constant specific heats such that \(c_v =
0.8\) \(kJ/kg\cdot K\) and \(c_p = 1.1 kJ/kg\cdot K\), determine: $BR
1. the specific heat ratio of the gas $BR
2. the temperature of the gas at the two compressor exits $BR
3. the mass flow rate of the gas $BR
