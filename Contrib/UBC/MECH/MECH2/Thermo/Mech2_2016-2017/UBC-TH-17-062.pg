BEGIN_TEXT
A constant-volume tank contains \($mass\) \(kg\) of air at \($P\)
\(kPa\) and \($Tt\)\(°C\). The air is cooled to the surroundings temperature
of \($Ta°C\). Assume constant specific heats at \(300K\) (\(C_v=0.718\) \(kJ/Kg\cdot K\)). Determine: $BR
$SPACE 1. the entropy change of the air in the tank during
the process $BR
$SPACE 2. heat transfer to the surroundings  $BR
$SPACE 3. entropy change of the surroundings  $BR
$SPACE 4. entropy change of the universe $BR
