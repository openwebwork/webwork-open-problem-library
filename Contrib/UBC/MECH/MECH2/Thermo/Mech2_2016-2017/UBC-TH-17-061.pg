Energy transport by mass
$PAR 
Steam is leaving a \($Volume\) \(L\) pressure cooker whose operating pressure is \(150\) \(kPa\).
It is observed that the amount of liquid in the cooker has
decreased by \($del_vol\) \(L\) in \($time\) \(min\) after the steady operating conditions are
established, and the cross-sectional area of the exit opening is \($Aera\) \(mm^2\).
Determine: $BR
$SPACE 1. the mass of steam that left the pressure cooker in that period of time $BR
$SPACE 2. the mass flow rate of the steam $BR
$SPACE 3. the exit velocity of the steam $BR
$SPACE 4. flow energy of the steam per unit mass $BR
$SPACE 5. the total energy of the steam per unit mass $BR
$SPACE 6. the rate at which energy leaves the cooker in the form of steam $BR
