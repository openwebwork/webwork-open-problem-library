BEGIN_TEXT
In a dairy plant, milk at \(4°C\) is pasteurized continuously
at \(72°C\) at a rate of \($Volume_flow\) \(L/s\) for \(24 h\) a day and \(365\) days
a year. The milk is heated to the pasteurizing temperature by
hot water heated in a natural-gas-fired boiler that has an efficiency
of \($Eff_boiler\) percent. The pasteurized milk is then cooled by
cold water at \(18°C\) before it is finally refrigerated back to
\(4°C\). To save energy and money, the plant installs a regenerator
that has an effectiveness of \($Eff_regenerator %\). If the cost of natural
gas is \($Gas_cost\) dollar/therm (1 therm = \(105,500 kJ\)), determine: $BR
$SPACE 1. how much heat should transfer to the milk $BR
$SPACE 2. how much heat will be saved in the current regenerator$BR
$SPACE 3. how much energy and money the company saves per year $BR $PAR

$BITALIC (assume \(\rho_{milk}=1\) \(kg/L\) and C_{p_{milk} is \(3.79 kJ/kg\cdot °C\)) $EITALIC
$PAR
\{ image("UBC-TH-17-065.png", width=>$width, height=>$height) \}


$PAR  
\(\dot{Q_{milk}}=\) \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(kJ/s\) $PAR
Heat saved in the regenerator = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(kJ/s\) $PAR
Energy saved due to saving fuel feeding the boiler per year = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(therm/yr\) $PAR
Money saved due to saving fuel feeding the boiler per year = \{ ans_rule(10)\} $\(/yr\) $PAR



#$BITALIC Pay attention to the unit of each parameter $EITALIC
