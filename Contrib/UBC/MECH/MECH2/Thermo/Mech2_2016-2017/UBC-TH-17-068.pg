BEGIN_TEXT
The structure of a house is such that it loses heat at a
rate of \($QH_ratehour\) \(kJ/h\) per \(°C\) difference between the indoors and
outdoors. A heat pump that requires a power input of \($W\) \(kW\) is
used to maintain this house at \($TH_C °C\). Determine the lowest
outdoor temperature for which the heat pump can meet the
heating requirements of this house, COP of the heat pump and the house's heat loss.
