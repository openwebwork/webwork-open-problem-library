As shown in the diagram, a large, rigid, rectangular billboard sits on top of an elastic supporting column. When the wind is blowing at a high velocity [`V`], there is some concern about the resulting deflection, [`\delta`] of the billboard structure. Using a [`1 : [$Scale]`] scale model, a wind tunnel operating under standard atmospheric conditions will be used to analyze the effects of wind on the bending of the structure. Assume the important column variables are its length and cross-section. The model and prototype are made of the same material and it`s the modulus of elasticity can be assumed. The critical "wind" variables are air density and velocity. 

1. What is the deflection of the prototype model experiences [`1`] [`cm`] of deflection?
2. What wind tunnel velocity is necessary to match a [`[$V]`] [`km/hr`] wind?


[`\delta=`] [____]{"$Ansa"} [`cm`]  
[`U=`] [____]{"$Ansb"} [`km/hr`]
