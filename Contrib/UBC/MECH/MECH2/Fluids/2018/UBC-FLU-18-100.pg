An incompressible fluid flows over a horizontal smooth plate, exposed to the atmosphere. As shown in the diagram, an obstacle with a square cross section is placed on the smooth plate. In order to predict the depth of the fluid, [`y`], along the plate, a model with a length scale of [`[$Scale]`] and a fluid density scale of [`1.0`] is to be developed. Determine the required viscosity and surface tension scales. Assume the following are important to the model: inertial, gravitational, surface tension, and viscous effects.

Viscosity: [____]{"$Ansa"}  
Surface tension: [____]{"$Ansb"}
