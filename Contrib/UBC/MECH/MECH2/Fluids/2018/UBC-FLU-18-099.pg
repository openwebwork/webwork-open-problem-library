As shown in the diagram, a fluid flows through a pipe in which a sphere is located. The drag on the sphere in the pipe is to be experimentally determined. Assume that the drag can be expressed as a function of the following: sphere diameter, the pipe diameter, the fluid velocity, and the fluid density. An experiment was performed using water which indicated that for a sphere diameter of [`0.2`] [`in`], the drag was [`1.5 \cdot 10^{-3}`] [`lb`] using a pipe diameter of [`[$d]`] [`in`], and a fluid velocity of [`[$V]`] [`ft/s`]. What is the drag on the sphere in a pipe with a diameter of [`2`] [`ft`] through which water is flowing at [`6`] [`ft/s`]? The sphere diameter is modified so geometric similarity is maintained.
