BEGIN_PGML
The maximum blood pressure in the upper arm of a healthy person is about [`[$a]`] [`mmHg`]. If a vertical tube open to the atmosphere is connected to the vein in the arm of the person, determine how high the blood will rise in the tube. Take the density of blood to be [`1040 `] [`kg/m^3`], and the density of Mercury to be [`13,595`] [`kg/m^3`].
