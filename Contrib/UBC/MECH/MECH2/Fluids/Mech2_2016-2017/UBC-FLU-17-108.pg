BEGIN_PGML
A healthy person has a maximum blood pressure in their upper arm of about [`[$a]`] [`mmHg`]. If a vertical tube is connected to the vein in the upper arm, with the other end of the tube open to the atmosphere, how high will the blood rise in the tube? Assume the density of blood is [`1040 `] [`kg/m^3`], and the density of Mercury is [`13,595`] [`kg/m^3`].
