BEGIN_PGML

Water is to be dispensed from a water reservoir which is [`[$A]`] [::m::] high through a hole at the bottom which is [`[$B]`] [::cm::] in diameter. Ignoring the effect of the kinetic energy correction factor, if the entrance of the hole is well-rounded, what is the flow rate of water through the hole?


[`\dot{V}=`] [_____]{$ans} [`m^3/s`]
