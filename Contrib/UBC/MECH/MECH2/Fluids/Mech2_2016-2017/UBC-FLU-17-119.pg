BEGIN_PGML

As shown in the diagram, a hair dryer is comprised of electrical resistors located in line with a fan in a duct. The duct can be considered to be of a constant diameter. The fan draws air in and past the resistors, which have current flowing through them and heat up, and in turn heat the air. If the air density is measured at the inlet and exit to be [$g1] [`kg / m^3`] and [$g2] [`kg / m^3`] respectively, what is the percent increase in the velocity of air as it passes through the hair dryer?

Percent increase = [________]{$ans}[`%`]
