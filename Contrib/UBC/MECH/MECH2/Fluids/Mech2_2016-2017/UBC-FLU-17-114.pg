BEGIN_PGML
An old cylindrical hydrometer with a diameter of [`1`] [`cm`] whose markings have been completely wiped out is to be used to measure the density of a liquid. The hydrometer is dropped into water with a density of [`1000`] [`kg/m^3`], and the water level marked on the hydrometer. The hydrometer is then placed into the liquid of unknown density. It is observed that the original mark made when the hydrometer was placed in water now sits [`[$a]`] [`cm`] above the current liquid-air interface. If the height of the watermark is [`[$b]`] [`cm`], what is the density of the liquid? Note: Assume the hydrometer is a perfect cylinder.


[`\rho_{liquid}=`] [_______]{$h} [`kg/m^3`]
