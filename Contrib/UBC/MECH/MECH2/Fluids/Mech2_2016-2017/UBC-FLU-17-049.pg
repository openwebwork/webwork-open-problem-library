BEGIN_PGML
Consider a rectangular foam boat [`[$w]`] [`cm`] wide by [`[$l]`] [`cm`] long by [`[$d]`] [`cm`] deep. Imagine this boat is loaded with enough cargo so the bottom sits [`[$wl]`] [`cm`] below the waterline. Determine the initial acceleration of the boat if the driving mass is [`[$dm]`] [`g`], and the density of water is [`\rho=1000`] [`kg/m^3`].
