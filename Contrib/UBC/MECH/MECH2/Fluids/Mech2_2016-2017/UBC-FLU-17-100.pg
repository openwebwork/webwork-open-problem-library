BEGIN_PGML
A pump is used to move water from one large reservoir to another large reservoir which is elevated. Both reservoirs are exposed to the atmosphere. The performance data of the water pump fits the curve [`H_{available} = H_0 - a (\frac{dV}{dt})^2`], where the shutoff head [`H_0 = [$a]`] [`m`], and coefficient [`a = 0.0453 `] [`m/(Lpm)^2`]. The curve simplifies to [`H_{required} = ( z_2 - z_1) + b (\frac{dV}{dT})^2`], where elevation difference [`(z_2 - z_1)= [$b]`] [`m`], and coefficient [`b = 0.0261`] [`m/(Lpm)^2`]. What is the operating point of the pump ([`(\frac{dV}{dt})_{operating}`] and [`H_{operating}`]).

[`(\frac{dV}{dt})_{operating}=`] [____________________]{$v_dot} [`Lpm`]

[`H_{operating} =`] [____________________]{$h} [`m`]
