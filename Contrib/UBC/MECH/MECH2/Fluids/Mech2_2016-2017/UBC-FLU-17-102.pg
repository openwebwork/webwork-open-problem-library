BEGIN_PGML 
An air compressor operates by increasing the density ([`\rho_{out} > \rho_{in}`])  and pressure ([`P_{out} > P_{in}`]) of the air as it passes through. When the inlet and outlet diameters are equal ([`D_{in} = D_{out} `]), how does the average airspeed change across the compressor? Is [`V_{out}`] less than, equal to, or greater than [`V_{in}`]?
