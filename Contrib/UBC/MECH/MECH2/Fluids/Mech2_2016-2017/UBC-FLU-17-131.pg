BEGIN_PGML

Oil with [`\rho=[$A]`] [`kg/m^3`] and [`u=[$B]`] [`kg/m3`] flows through a [`[$C]`] [::cm::] diameter pipe which discharges into the [`[$D]`] [::kPa::] atmosphere. [`[$E]`] [::m::] before the exit, the absolute pressure is shown on a gauge to be [$F] [::kPa::]. If the pipe is at an incline [`[$G]^{\circ}`] upward from horizontal, what is the flow rate of oil through the pipe?  

Assumptions: (1) the flow is steady and incompressible, (2) entrance effects are negligible, and the flow is fully developed, (3) the flow is laminar (to be verified), (4) there are no bends, valves, and connectors in the pipe, and (5) there are no work devices (Pumps and turbines)  in the piping section.
