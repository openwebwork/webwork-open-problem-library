BEGIN_PGML
Your classmate drives a car with an ornamental ball mounted on the car antenna. The frontal area of the ball is [`[$a]`] [`m^2`].  As a starving student, they are worried that the drag caused by the ball is causing unnecessary fuel usage and wasting money.  Estimate how many liters of fuel they waste per year due to the drag imposed by the ball. Additional information: The drag coefficient of the ball is [`0.2`] (based on frontal area). They drive [`[$b]`] [`km/yr`], at an average speed of [`[$c]`] [`km/hr`]. The vehicle efficiency is [`[$d]`], the density of the fuel is [`[$e]`] [`kg/litre`], and the heating value of fuel is [`44,020`] [`kJ/kg`].  Air density in the region averages [`1.25`] [`kg/m3`].
