BEGIN_TEXT

Consider a periodic von Karman vortex street which is created when a uniform stream is flowing over a circular cylinder.  Using the method of repeating variables, find a dimensionless relationship for von Karman vortex shedding frequency \(f_k\) as a function of free-stream speed \(V\), fluid density \(p\), fluid viscosity \(u\), cylinder diameter \(D\), and speed of sound \(c\).
