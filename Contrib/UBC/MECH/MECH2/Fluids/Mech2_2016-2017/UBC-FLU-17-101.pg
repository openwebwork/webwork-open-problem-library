As shown in the diagram, one large water reservoir sits atop a hill, [`[$delta_z]`] [`m`] above another large water reservoir; Both reservoirs are exposed to atmospheric pressure. A pump is used to pump water from the lower reservoir up to the higher one. The pump’s performance can be modelled by the expression [`H_{available} = H_0 - a (dV/dt)^2`], where shutoff head of water column is [`H_0 = [$a]`] [`m`] and coefficient [`a = [$b]`] [`m/(Lpm)^2`]. Available pump head [`H_{available}`] has units of meters of water column, and capacity [`(dV/dt)`] has units of liters per minute ([`Lpm`]). What is the capacity delivered by the pump.  Use the turbulent pipe flow friction factor equation on the MECH 222F Formula Sheet. Assume [`L = [$L]`] [`m`], [`D = [$D*100]`] [`cm`], total minor losses, [`k = [$k]`], roughness, [`\epsilon=[$eps]`], and that flow is  laminar with [`U = [$U]`] [`m/s`].
