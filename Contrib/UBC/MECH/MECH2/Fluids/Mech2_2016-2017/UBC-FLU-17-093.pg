BEGIN_PGML
A submarine can be modelled as an ellipsoid, with dimensions [`[$a]`] [`m`] in diameter and  [`[$b]`] [`m`] in length. What is the power required for this submarine to travel horizontally at a constant speed of [`[$c]`] [`km/h`] in seawater with a density of [`1025`] [`kg/m^3`]. How much power is required to tow this submarine in air with a density of [`1.25`] [`kg/m`]. Assume turbulent flow in both cases. 

Power required to travel horizontally at a constant speed = [____________________]{$d} [`W`]

Power required to tow submarine in air = [____________________]{$e} [`W`]
