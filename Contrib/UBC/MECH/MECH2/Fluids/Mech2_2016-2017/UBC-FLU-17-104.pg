BEGIN_PGML
In the combustion process of a gasoline engine, the contents of the combustion chamber before and after combustion can be considered to be air. The process can be treated as a constant volume heat addition process.  The conditions before combustion are [`[$a]`] [`MPa`] and [`[$b]^{\circ}C`] and after combustion the temperature is [`[$c]^{\circ} C`]. What is the pressure MPa at the end of the combustion process?

[`P =`] [__________]{$h} [`MPa`]
