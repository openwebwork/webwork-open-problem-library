BEGIN_PGML
As shown in the diagram, a V-shaped water trough has sides which are hinged at the bottom to make an angle of [`45^{\circ}`] with the ground on both sides. The sides have a width of [`L=[$a]`] [`m`], and are held at the top with a cable and turnbuckle every  [`[$b]`] [`m`] along the length of the trough. If the trough is filled to the rim, what is the tension in each cable?
