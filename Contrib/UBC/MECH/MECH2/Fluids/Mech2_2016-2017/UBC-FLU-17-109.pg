BEGIN_PGML
A woman weighing [`[$a]`] [`kg`] has a total foot imprint area of [`[$b]`] [`cm^2`]. She is planning to go snowshoeing and wants to pick the right size of snowshoes, as she knows the snow cannot withstand pressures higher than [`[$c]`] [`kPa`]. What is the minimum size of the snowshoes she needs (imprint area per shoe, in [`m^2`]) to be able to walk on the snow without sinking?

Imprint Area/Shoe = [____________________]{"$h"} [`m^2`]
