BEGIN_TEXT

A jet of water (density of \(1000\) \(kg/m^3\)) from a nozzle travels in the \(x\) direction, initially along the surface of a vane. A short distance later, the vane curves downward and the jet is deflected through an angle of \(60^{\circ}\). The jet initially has a mean velocity of \(U_0\) \(=\) \(30\) \(m/s\) and it leaves the vane with a mean velocity of \(U_1\) \(=\) \(25\) \(m/s\). If the discharge rate from the nozzle is \(0.8\) \(kg/s\), calculate the direction of the resultant force on the vane (if the vane is stationary). (Measure the angle counter-clockwise from the x-axis.)
