BEGIN_PGML

A method of cooling a house located in an area with low night-time temperatures is to use a fan to pull air from the interior of the house into a ventilated attic space. Suppose a house has an air volume of [`[$A]`] [::m**3::], and a fan is installed which has a diameter of [`[$B]`] [::m::]. What is the required flow rate of the fan (a) and the average discharge speed of air (b) if the air in the house is to be exchanged once every [`20`] minutes?

a) Required flow rate = [________]{$ans1}[`m^3/s`]

b) Velocity = [________]{$ans2}[`m/s`]
