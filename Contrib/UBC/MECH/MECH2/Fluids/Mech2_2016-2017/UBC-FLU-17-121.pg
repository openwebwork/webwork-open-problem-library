BEGIN_PGML

A water jet is directed horizontally at [`[$A]`] [`m/s`] against a plate oriented vertically. The water splashes off the sides in the vertical plane and a force of of [`[$B]`] [::N::] is required horizontally to hold the plate against the water stream.  What is the volume flow rate of the water?

Flow rate = [________]{$ans}[`m^3/s`]
