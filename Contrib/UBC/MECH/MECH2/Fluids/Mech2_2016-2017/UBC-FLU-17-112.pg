BEGIN_PGML
Consider an aboveground swimming pool filled to the rim with dimensions [`[$a]`] [`m`] long, [`[$a]`] [`m`] wide, and [`[$b]`] [`m`]. 

(a) What is the hydrostatic force in kiloNewtons on each wall?

(b) In meters, what is the distance of the line of action of this hydrostatic force from the ground?

(c) What will be the effect if the height of the walls of the pool is doubled and the pool is filled to the rim again with these new dimensions? Will the hydrostatic force on each wall double or quadruple?

(a) = [________]{$h} [`kN`]

(b) = [_________]{$i} [`m`]

(c) = [_________]{$j} Enter 2 if double, or 4 if quadruple is the answer
