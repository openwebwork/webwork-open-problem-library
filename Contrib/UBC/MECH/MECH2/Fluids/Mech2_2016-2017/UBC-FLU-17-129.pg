BEGIN_PGML

[`15^{\circ}C`] Water with [`\rho=999.1`] [`kg/m^3`] and [`u=`][::1.138 * 10**-3::] [`kg/ms`] flows steadily at a rate of  [`[$C]`] [`litres/s`] through a horizontal stainless steel pipe which is [`[$A]`] [::m::] long and [`[$B]`] [::cm::] in diameter.  

(a) What is the pressure drop?  
(b) What is the head loss?  
(c) What is the pumping power requirement to overcome this pressure loss?  
Note: The answer computation uses the Haaland equation for the friction factor.


a) [::Drop::] = [_____]{$ansA} [::kPa::]  
b) [::Head::] [::loss::] = [_____]{$ansB} [::m::]  
a) [::Power::] = [_____]{$ansC} [::kW::]
