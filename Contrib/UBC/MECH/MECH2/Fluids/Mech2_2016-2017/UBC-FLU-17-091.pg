BEGIN_PGML
Using a large wind tunnel with design conditions of [`1`] [`atm`], [`25`] [`C`], and [`[$a]`] [`km/h`] the drag coefficient of a car is to be determined experimentally. The height of the car is [`[$b]`] [`m`] and width of the car is [`[$c]`] [`m`]. During the test, a horizontal force of [`[$d]`] [`N`] was recorded to be acting on the car. What is the total drag coefficient of this car? Use an air density of [`1.184`] [`kg/m^3`]?


Total Drag Coefficient = [_______]{$e}
