BEGIN_PGML
As illustrated in the diagram, a [`[$a]`] [`cm`] x [`[$a]`] [`cm`] thin flat plate is pulled horizontally at [`v_1=`]  [`[$b]`] [`m/s`] through an oil layer with thickness [`3.6`] [`mm`]. The oil layer is between two plates, one stationary, the other moving at a constant velocity [`v_2=`] [`[$c]`] [`m/s`]. 

>> [@ image("UBC-FLU-17-106.png", height=>[$height], width=>[$width]) @]* <<

The oil`s dynamic viscosity  is [`[$d] Pa\cdot s`].  Assume the velocity of each oil layer varies linearly. What is the force that needs to be applied to the plate to maintain this motion?
