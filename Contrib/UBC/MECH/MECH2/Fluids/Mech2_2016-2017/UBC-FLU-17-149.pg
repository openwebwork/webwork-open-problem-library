BEGIN_TEXT

A boundary layer is a thin region, generally along a surface, in which viscous forces are significant and within which the flow is rotational. As shown in the diagram, a steady flow creates a boundary layer which grows along a thin flat plate. \(\delta\), the boundary layer thickness, at any downstream distance \(x\) is a function of free-stream velocity \(V\), and the fluid's density \(p\) and viscosity \(u\). Using the method of repeating variables, create a dimensionless relationship for \(d\) as a function of the other parameters.
