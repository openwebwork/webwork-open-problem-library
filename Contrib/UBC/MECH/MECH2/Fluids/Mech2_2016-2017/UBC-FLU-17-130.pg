BEGIN_PGML

Oil with [`\rho=[$A]`] [`kg/m^3`] and [`u=[$B]`] [`kg/ms`] flows at an average velocity of [`[$D]`] [`m/s`] through a [`[$C]`] [::cm::] diameter pipeline. A section of the pipeline [`[$E]`] [::m::] long passes through the icy waters of a lake. Ignoring the entrance effects, what is the pumping power necessary to overcome the pressure losses and maintain the flow of oil in the pipe?
