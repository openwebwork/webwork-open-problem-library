BEGIN_PGML

A gas tank has both a pressure gauge and a manometer connected to it to measure its pressure. If the pressure gauge reads [`[$Pg]`] [`kPa`], what is the distance [`h`] between the two fluid levels of the manometer if the fluid is:  
(a) mercury ([`\rho=[$Hg]/`][::kg::][::m**3::])?  
(b) water ([`\rho=[$water]/`][::kg::][::m**3::])?


[@ image( "UBC-FLU-17-135.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

a) [`h_{Hg}=`][________]{$ans1}[::m::]

b) [`h_{H_2O}=`][________]{$ans2}[::m::]
