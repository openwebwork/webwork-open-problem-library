BEGIN_PGML
During major windstorms, tall vehicles such as RVs and semis can be blown off the road and train boxcars off their tracks. This damage is more common when these vehicles are empty and in open areas. Consider a semi-truck with an empty weight of [`[$a]`] [`kg`], length of [`10`] [`m`], height of [`2.5`] [`m`], width of [`2`] [`m`]. The gap between the bottom of the truck and the road is [`0.75`] [`m`]. The semi-truck is exposed to winds from the side. What is the wind velocity in [`m/s`] that will result in the semi-truck tipping over to its side? Use an air density of [`1.25`] [`kg/m^3`] and assume the weight is uniformly distributed. Treat the truck as a rectangular plate.

Wind velocity = [____________________]{$b} [`m/s`]
