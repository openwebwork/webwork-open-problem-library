BEGIN_PGML

A vented tanker is filled with oil ([`\rho=[$A]`] [`kg/m^3`] and [`\mu=[$B]`] [`kg/(m \cdot s)`]) from an underground reservoir by a [`[$C]`] [::m::] long, [`[$DD]`] [::cm::] diameter plastic hose. The hose has a slightly rounded entrance and two smooth [`90^{\circ}`] bends. The hose discharges at the top of the tanker, which is [`[$E]`] [::m::] above the oil level in the reservoir. The tanker has a capacity of [`[$G]`] [::m**3::] and is filled in [`30`] minutes.

If the kinetic energy correction factor at hose discharge is [`1.05`] and the pump has an overall efficiency of [`82 %`], What is the required power input to the pump?

Note: The solution will use the Haaland equation for the friction factor.
