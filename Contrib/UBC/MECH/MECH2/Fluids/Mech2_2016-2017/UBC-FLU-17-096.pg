BEGIN_PGML
A cargo truck is traveling at [`[$a]`] [`km/h`]. The cargo compartment of the truck is a [`2.5`] [`m`] high, [`2`] [`m`] wide, and [`6`] [`m`] long rectangular box. The airflow over the entire outer surface is turbulent and attached (no flow separation). What is the friction drag force on the top and side surfaces of the cargo compartment and the power required to overcome this drag? Assume the atmospheric conditions of the air are [`1`] [`atm`] and [`0`] [`C`].

Power required to overcome drag = [____________________]{$b} [`W`]
