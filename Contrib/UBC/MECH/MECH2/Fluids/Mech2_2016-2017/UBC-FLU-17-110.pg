BEGIN_PGML
The barometer of a mountain hiker reads [`[$a]`] [`mbars`] at the beginning of a hiking trip and [`[$b]`] [`mbars`] at the end. Neglecting the effect of altitude on local gravitational acceleration, determine the vertical distance climbed. Assume an average air density of [`1.2`] [`kg/m^3`].

Vertical Distance Climbed = [____________________]{$h} [`m`]
