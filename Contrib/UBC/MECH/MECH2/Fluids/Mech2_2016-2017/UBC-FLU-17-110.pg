BEGIN_PGML
At the beginning of a hiking trip, a hiker uses a barometer and it reads [`[$a]`] [`mbars`]. At the end of the trip, the barometer reads [`[$b]`] [`mbars`]. Ignoring the effect of altitude on local gravitational acceleration, what is the vertical distance the hiker has climbed? Assume average air density is [`1.2`] [`kg/m^3`].

Vertical Distance Climbed = [____________________]{$h} [`m`]
