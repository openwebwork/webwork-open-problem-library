BEGIN_PGML
The temperature of air in an automobile tire has an effect on the pressure of the tire. At an air temperature of [`[$P] C`], the absolute pressure in the tire is [`[$L] kPa`].  The volume of the tire is [`[$V] m^3`], how much does the pressure rise in the tire when the air temperature in the tire increases to [`[$T] C`]?

[`Pressure`]-[`Rise = `] [_____]{Compute("(($L)*(273+$T)/(273+$P))-$L")->cmp(tolType=>"relative",tolerance=>"0.05")}
