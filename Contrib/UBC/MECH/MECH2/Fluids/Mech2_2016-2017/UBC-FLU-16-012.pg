BEGIN_PGML

As shown in the diagram, an automatic gate is comprised of a long, cylinder of radius [`[$radius]`] [`m`] which is hinged at point [`A`].
The gate opens when the long cylinder is rotated about the hinge at point [`A`], which occurs when the water level reaches [`[$level]`] [`m`]. 

1. What is the hydrostatic force acting on the cylinder and its line of action when the gate opens?

2. What is the weight of the cylinder per [`m`] length of the cylinder?
