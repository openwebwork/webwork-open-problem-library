A steel surveyor's tape is used to check the length of a football field (a typical field would be [`360`] [`ft`] long, this one may be slightly different). The tape is designed to be used at [`60^{\circ}F`] with an axial tension force of [`20`] [`lb`] applied to keep it in a straight line. The marks on the tape give the correct reading under these conditions. When used on a day when the temperature is [`[$T]^{\circ}F`], and with an axial tension force [`P = [$P]`] [`lb`], the reading on the tape is [`[$L]`] [`ft`]. The tape is [`0.2`][`"`] wide, [`0.050`][`"`] thick, with [`E = 30\cdot 10^6`] [`psi`] and [`\alpha=6\cdot 10^{-6}/^{\circ}F`].

What is the actual length of the football field? (Give your answer in feet, with two decimal places.)
