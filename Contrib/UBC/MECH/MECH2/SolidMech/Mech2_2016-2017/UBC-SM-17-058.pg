BEGIN_PGML

An industrial bandsaw of total length [`L = [$L]`] [::m::] and width [`w = [$w]`] [::m::] is tightened between two wheels, each of diameter [`D = [$D]`] [::m::]. The total force between the wheels [`F = [$F]`] [::kN::]. For saw-blade steel, [`E = 200`] [`GPa`], [`\nu = 0.3`]. What thickness would you choose to minimize the tensile stress within the saw-blade?
