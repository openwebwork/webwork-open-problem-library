A shalt of solid circular cross section consisting of two segments is shown in the first part of the figure. The left-hand segment has a diameter of [`[$d1]`] [`mm`] and length of [`[$l1]`] [`m`] the right-hand segment has a diameter of [`[$d2]`] [`mm`] and length of [`[$l2]`] [`m`].

Shown in the second part of the figure is a hollow shaft made of the same material and having the same length. The thickness [`t`] of the hollow shaft is [`d/10`], where [`d`] is the outer diameter. Both shafts are subjected to the same torque.

1. If the hollow shaft is to have the same torsional stiffness as the solid shaft, what should be its outer diameter [`d`]?
2.  If torque [`T`] is applied at either end of both shafts, and the hollow shaft is to have the same maximum shear stress as the solid shaft what should be its outer diameter [`d`]?

[`d_{o_1}=`] [_____]{"$d4"} [`mm`]  
[`d_{o_2}=`] [_____]{"$d42"} [`mm`]
