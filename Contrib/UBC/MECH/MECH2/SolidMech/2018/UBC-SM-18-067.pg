Part of a machine is comprised of three pipes welded together with rigid plates between them, as shown in the diagram. Loads of [`P1 = [$p1]`] [`kN`], [`P2 = [$p2]`] [`kN`], and [`P3 = [$p3]`] [`kN`], are supported by the rigid plates. The three pipes are mild steel and have yield stress [`\sigma_Y=[$yield]`] [`MPa`] and Young's modulus [`E=[$e]`] [`GPa`]. What are the required cross-section areas so that a safety factor of [`[$sf]`] is maintained throughout this part of the machine.
