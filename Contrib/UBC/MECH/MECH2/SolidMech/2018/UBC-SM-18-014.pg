A vertical load [`P = [$p]`] [`kN`] is supported by a rigid structure using a structural device as shown in the figure above. In the device, a flexible rectangular piece (synthetic rubber) of height [`h = [$h]`] [`mm`], width [`b = [$b]`] [`mm`], and thickness [`t`] is firmly glued between two rigid metal plates in order to absorb shock and vibration. The device is attached to the structure using steel bolts and nuts of shank diameter [`d = [$d]`] [`mm`] and allowable shear stress [`\tau=[$tauAllow]`] [`MPa`].  
1.	If the vertical movements at the point of application of the load [`P`] is to be limited to [`[$delta]`] [`mm`], determine a suitable thickness [`t`] for the flexible piece. The shear modulus of the flexible piece, [`G = [$g]`] [`MPa`].  
2.	Determine how many bolts would be needed.  

[`t=`] [____][`mm`]  
[`n_{bolts}=`] [____]

_Assume that the load is equally distributed among all the bolts_.
