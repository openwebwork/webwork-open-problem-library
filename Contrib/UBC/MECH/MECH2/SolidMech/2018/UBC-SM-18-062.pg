A jib crane consists of a [`L=[$l]`] [`ft`] long rigid horizontal beam [`AC`], which is pinned to the wall at [`A`], as shown in the figure. A [`[$d]`][`"`] diameter cable [`BC`], supports the beam and is pinned at each end, creating an angle [`ACB`] of [`[$thetaD]^{\circ}`] between the beam and cable. There is a small chain hoist on the bottom flange of the beam which can support up to [`[$load]`] [`lb`]. What is the maximum distance [`x`] from point [`A`] that the hoist can move such that the stress in the cable does not surpass [`[$yield]`] [`ksi`]. Apply a safety factor of [`[$sf]`].
