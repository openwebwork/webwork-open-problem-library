BEGIN_PGML

A tensile-testing apparatus is to be constructed that must withstand a maximum load of [`[$F]`] [`kN`]. The design calls for two cylindrical support posts, each of which is to support half of the maximum load. Furthermore, plain-carbon (1045) steel ground and polished shafting rounds are to be used; The minimum yield and tensile strengths of this alloy are [`[$Y]`] [`MPa`] and [`565.0`] [`MPa`] respectively. Specify a suitable diameter for these support posts assuming a factor of safety of [`[$N]`].
