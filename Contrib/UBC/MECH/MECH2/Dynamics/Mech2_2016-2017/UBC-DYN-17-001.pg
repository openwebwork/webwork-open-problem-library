$PAR
Find the mass moment of inertia, \(Izz\), for the spherical ceramic femoral head ball (with a cylindrical hole) from a total hip replacement. Assume that \(r\) \(= $r\) \(cm\), and density is a uniform \($rho\) \(g/cm^3\). 

$PAR
(Recall that reasonable approximations around the intersection of round and flat objects are acceptable; select a simple approximation).

$PAR  
\(I_{zz}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(kg\)-\(m^2\) $PAR
