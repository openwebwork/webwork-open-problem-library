BEGIN_TEXT
A force that varies according to a relation \( F = \frac{-t^2}{3} \, N\), where \( t \) is the elapsed time in seconds, is applied to a \( 0.32 kg\) mass traveling with a speed of \( 16m/s \). Determine the time required for the mass to come to a complete stop. Assume the force is initially zero and the mass travels in the horizontal plane.
