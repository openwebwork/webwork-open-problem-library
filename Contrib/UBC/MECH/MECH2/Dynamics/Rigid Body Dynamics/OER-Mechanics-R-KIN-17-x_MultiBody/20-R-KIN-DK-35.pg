Students are working on a prototype of a switch for their design team. The switch consists of 3 slender rods, each with a mass
of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`], welded to a linkage system. The rods are assembled in such a shape to resemble that of the letter H,
with the shortest rod of length [`l_1 = `] [`[$l1]`] [`m`] acting as the bridge. The rod on the left has a length
[`l_2 = `] [`[$l2]`] [`m`] and the rod on the right has a length [`l_3 = `] [`[$l3]`] [`m`]. The linkage arms each have a length of
[`l_{arms} = `] [`[$l4]`] [`m`]. Determine the internal forces and the moment that the linkage system exerts on the rods at the instant
[`\theta = `] [`[$theta]`][`^{\circ}`]. The two pinned linkage arms have an angular velocity of [`\omega = `] [`[$angvel]`] [`rad/s`] and 
an angular acceleration of [`\alpha = `] [`[$angaccel]`] [`rad/s^2`] at this instant.

[`R_x = `] [____]{"$Rx"} [`N`]  
[`R_y = `] [____]{"$Ry"} [`N`]  
[`M = `] [____]{"$Mr"} [`N \cdot m`]
