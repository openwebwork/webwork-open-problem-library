Your team is prototyping a simple braking system for your model car. The [`[$m]`] [`kg`] wheel with a radius of [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`] is rotating at [`\omega = `] [`[$omega]`] [`rad/s`].
A servo motor can apply a variable force F, which in its first two seconds of operation is equal to [`F = 10t`] [`N`] and afterwards is equivalent to a constant force of [`F = 20`] [`N`]. If the coefficient
of kinetic friction between the braking arm and the wheel is [`\mu_k = `] [`[$mu]`], determine the time needed for the wheel to come to a full stop. The point of contact P between the wheel and the arm
is a distance [`r_{P/A} = `] [`-[$rPAx]`] [`\hat{\imath}`] [`+`] [`[$rPAy]`] [`\hat{\jmath}`] [`m`] from point A. The force of the servo motor is applied at exactly half of the horizontal distance to A from the point 
of contact. Assume the wheel can be treated as a disk and that the braking arm is massless.

[`t = `] [____]{"$t"} [`s`]
