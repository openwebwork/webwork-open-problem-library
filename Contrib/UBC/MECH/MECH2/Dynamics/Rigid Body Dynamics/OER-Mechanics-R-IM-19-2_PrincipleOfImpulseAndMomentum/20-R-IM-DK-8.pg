You were able to obtain a roll of toilet paper during quarantine and put it to good use. If the roll rests against a wall where its coefficient of friction is [`\mu_k = `] [`[$mu]`] and you apply a vertical force 
[`F = `] [`[$F]`] [`N`] downwards, determine the magnitude of the angular velocity of the roll after [`t = `] [`[$t]`] [`s`]. Point B and point C are located a vertical distance [`l = `] [`[$l]`] [`m`] under point A.
Assume the roll can be treated as a cylinder with mass of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`], a width [`w = `] [`[$w]`] [`m`], and a radius of [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`]. Neglect the mass of the unraveled toilet paper and make
sure to wash your hands after.

[`\omega = `] [____]{"$omega"} [`rad/s`]
