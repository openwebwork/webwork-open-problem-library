A [`[$md]`] [`g`] dart is thrown at a swinging rectangular dart board with a painted bullseye. 
The dart hits the bullseye at a speed of [`v_d = `] [`[$vd]`] [`m/s`]. 
Find the angular velocity of the board around point p at the instant the dart hits the board.
Assume the mass of the board is [`m_b = `] [`[$mb]`] [`kg`], the mass of the connecting rod is [`m_r = `] [`[$mr]`] [`kg`], the length
of the rod is [`l_r = `] [`[$lr]`] [`m`], the length of the board is [`l_b = `] [`[$lb]`] [`m`] , and 
the thickness of the board is [`t = `] [`[$t]`] [`m`]. 
The dart sticks to the board after collision.
