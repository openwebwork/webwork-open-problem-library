A punch buggy is challenged to race. As it starts from rest, slamming on the accelerometer causes the rear wheels to slip.
If the punch buggy has a mass of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`] with a centre of gravity at G, determine the distance it would travel
in [`t = `] [`[$t]`] [`seconds`] and the normal force on each of its four wheels. Assume the mass of the wheels are negligible,
and the coefficients of static and kinetic friction are [`\mu_s = `] [`0.45`] and [`\mu_k = `] [`[$mu]`], respectively.  
The radius of both wheels is [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`]. G is a height of [`h = `] [`[$h]`] [`m`] from the bottom of the frame,
and [`d_A = `] [`[$dA]`] [`m`] and [`d_B = `] [`[$dB]`] [`m`].

[`N_{A} =`] [____]{"$NA"} [`N`]  
[`N_{B} =`] [____]{"$NB"} [`N`]  
  
[`s =`] [____]{"$s"} [`m`]
