Another kid constructs his own foam hammer to overthrow the previous foam hammer tyrant. The head of the hammer consists
of a rectangular plate and four circular disks. The handle is a lone rectangular plate. If point P acts as a pin in which the hammer rotates,
what is the hammer's radius of gyration about point P? The density of the foam is [`\rho = `] [`[$rho]`] [`kg/m^3`]. Assume that the
foam acts as a rigid body and the hammer is undergoing planar motion.  
Plate A has a length [`l_A = `] [`[$lAcm]`] [`cm`] and a width [`w_A = `] [`[$wAcm]`] [`cm`].  
Point P is located on plate A, a distance of [`d_y = `] [`1/4`] [`l_A`] from the bottom and [`d_x = `] [`1/2`] [`w_A`] from the side.  
Plate B has a length [`l_B = `] [`[$lBcm]`] [`cm`] and a width [`w_B = `] [`[$wBcm]`] [`cm`].
Plate C is identical to plates D, E, and F, and has a diameter equivalent to [`l_B`].  
Plate A, C, D, E, and F have a thickness of [`t_A = `] [`[$tAmm]`] [`mm`] while plate B has a thickness of [`t_B = `] [`[$tBmm]`] [`mm`].
