Two students are sitting on spinning chairs with their arms full extended, when they fully retract their arms.  

Student 1 weighs [`m_{s1} = `] [`[$ms1]`] [`kg`]  and holds  one weight that is 
[`m_{w1} = `] [`[$mw1]`] [`kg`] in each arm.  
Assume that, when extended, student's 1 body on the chair is a cylinder of radius [`r_{s1} = `] [`[$rs11]`] [`m`], and their arms are thin rods with a weight of [`m_{arm1} = `] [`[$ma1]`] [`kg`] each 
and a length of [`l_{arm1} = `] [`[$la1]`] [`m`]. When their arms are retracted, 
the body can be considered as a cylinder of [`r_{s1_2} = `] [`[$rs12]`] [`kg`] radius, 
with the weights acting as point masses on the outer radius . 
The initial speed is [`omega_{s1} = `] [`[$angvels11]`] [`rad/s`].

Student 2 weighs [`m_{s2} = `] [`[$ms2]`] [`kg`]  and holds  one weight that is 
[`m_{w2} = `] [`[$mw2]`] [`kg`] in each arm.  
Assume that, when extended, student's 1 body on the chair is a cylinder of radius [`r_{s2_1} = `] [`[$rs21]`] [`m`], and their arms are thin rods with a weight of [`m_{arm2} = `] [`[$ma2]`] [`kg`] each 
and a length of [`l_{arm2} = `] [`[$la2]`] [`m`]. When their arms are retracted, 
the body can be considered as a cylinder of [`r_{s2_2} = `] [`[$rs22]`] [`kg`] radius, 
with the weights acting as point masses on the outer radius . 
The initial speed is [`omega_{s2} = `] [`[$angvels21]`] [`rad/s`].


Neglecting the frictional forces, and  effects due to mass of the chairs, who completes 35 revolutions first, and in how much time does that student complete it?

[`Student`][`:`] [____]{"$ans"} []

[`Time`][`:`] [____]{"$ans2"} [`s`] 

 _Round your answers to three decimal places_.
