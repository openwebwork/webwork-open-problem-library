An engineering student sets up an experiment to record data such that she may apply her findings to a prototype. Specifically, she is curious about the velocity of a load on a pulley that is attached to a motor.
The pulley consists of two wheels rigidly attached to another, with a total radius of gyration of [`k_o = `] [`[$k]`] [`m`] and a total mass of [`m_{pulley} = `] [`[$mpulley]`] [`kg`]. The load, in this case a 
[`[$mcylinder]`] [`kg`] cylinder, is attached to a wire wrapped around the wheel with radius [`r_2 = `] [`[$r2]`] [`m`], and the motor is attached to a wire wrapped around the wheel with radius [`r_1 = `] [`[$r1]`] [`m`]
of the pulley. The ends of the wire are rigidly attached to the pulley and do not slip as the pulley rotates. Determine the velocity of the cylinder if the motor applies a constant tensional force [`F = `] [`[$F]`] [`N`]
after [`t = `] [`[$t]`] [`s`]. The cylinder is initially at rest.

[`v_{cylinder} = `] [____]{"$v"} [`m/s`]
