A punch buggy has a total mass of [`m_{tot} = `] [`[$mtot]`] [`kg`], including the mass of its passengers and its four wheels. Each wheel has a mass [`m_{wheel} = `] [`[$mwheel]`] [`kg`] and a radius of gyration
about its axle of [`k = `] [`[$k]`] [`m`]. You are just learning to drive the punch buggy and accidentally step on the accelerometer. If this causes the motor to apply a moment of [`M = `] [`[$M]`] [`N \cdot m`]
to the two rear wheels, determine the speed of your car and your panicked instructor after [`t = `] [`[$t]`] [`s`]. Each wheel has a radius [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`] and can be treated as if it were pinned on the
axle. Assume  the car rolls without slipping and starts from rest. Neglect the screams of your instructor while you do this calculation.
