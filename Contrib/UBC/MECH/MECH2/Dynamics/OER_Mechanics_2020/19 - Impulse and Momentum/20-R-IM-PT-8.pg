A high diver jumps from their diving board [`h = `] [`[$h]`] [`m`] from the  water. They
start the dive fully extended with an angular momentum of [`\omega_1 = `] [`[$angvel1]`] [`rad/s`]. 
Then they bring in their body to complete a several rotations before 
extending once again and landing in the water. If the persons center of mass 
is   [`h_{max} = `] [`[$hm]`] [`m`] above the water when they start to tuck, and [`[$he]`] [`m`] above the water when 
they extend their body, how many full revolutions can they complete before they 
have to extend into the water? 
Assume that, when fully extended, the divers body 
can be considered as a rod with a length of [`l_{diver} = `] [`[$ld]`] [`m`]. When they tuck, their body can be considered 
as a rod of length [`l_{diver_2} = `] [`[$ld2]`] [`m`], with a constant mass of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`]. 




[`Number`] [`of`] [`rotations`][`:`] [____]{"$ans"} []
