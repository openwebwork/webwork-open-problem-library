An engineering student is working on an experimental drive system that utilizes two wheels to shift between drive and neutral.
Wheel A rotates with a constant angular velocity of [`\omega_A = `] [`[$angvelA]`] [`rad/s`] and has a mass of [`m_A = `] [`[$mA]`] [`kg`].
Wheel B has a mass of [`m_B = `] [`[$mB]`] [`kg`] and is initially at rest when it is put into contact with wheel A.
If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two wheels is [`\mu_k = `] [`[$mu]`], determine the time required for wheel B to reach
the same angular speed as wheel A. Assume the two wheels can be modelled as disks with radius [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`] and that the mass of
the bar CD is negligible. The length of bar CD is given as [`l = `] [`[$l]`] [`m`] and the angle is [`\theta = `] [`[$theta]`][`^{\circ}`].
