In his new movie, Montana James makes a daring escape by cutting wire CD on a platform. The wire is actually a prop cable that instantly snaps when triggered,
and the footage is to be edited such that it looks as if Montana James cuts the wire in one swift motion. Before they film the scene, they do a test run without
Montana James to ensure everything works properly. If the platform has a mass of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`] and has a center of gravity at G, what would be the
angular acceleration of the platform and the tension in the cable AB immediately after the wire snapped? Assume the platform can be considered a slender rod.  
The platform has a length of [`l = `] [`[$l]`] [`m`] and wire AB is connected at exactly half of its length.  
The center of gravity G is found a horizontal distance [`r_{G/C} = `] [`[$rGC]`] [`m`] from C.  
The angle is given as [`\theta = `] [`[$theta]`][`^{\circ}`].  

[`\alpha =`] [____]{"$angaccel"} [`rad/s^2`]  
[`T_{AB} =`] [____]{"$FAB"} [`N`]
