An engineering student gets a co-op job at a door factory. They transport a door by pushing one on its side
with a horizontal force of [`F = `] [`[$F]`] [`N`]. If the door has a mass of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`] and initial
velocity of [`v_0 = `] [`[$vel]`] [`m/s`], how far would it travel in [`t = `] [`[$t]`] [`seconds`]? What are the
reaction forces at A and B?  
The center of gravity is an equal distance [`d = `] [`[$d]`] [`m`] away from rollers A and B.  
The door has a height [`h = `] [`[$h]`] [`m`] and the center of gravity is found at [`h/2`].
The student applies the force at a height [`y = `] [`[$y]`] [`m`] from the bottom of the door.
