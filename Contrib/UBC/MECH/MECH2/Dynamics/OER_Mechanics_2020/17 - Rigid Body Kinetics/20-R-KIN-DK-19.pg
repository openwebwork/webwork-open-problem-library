Your friend is trying to carefully move his mom's modern-art sculpture by dragging a rug underneath it.
What is the maximum acceleration of the rug without causing the sculpture to move relative to the rug?
Determine the normal reaction on the sculpture's legs if the sculpture has a mass of [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`]
with a centre of gravity at G. Assume the coefficient of static and kinetic friction to be [`\mu_s = `] [`[$mu]`]
and [`\mu_k = `] [`0.15`] respectively. The center of gravity is located at a height [` = `] [`[$h]`] [`m`] from the ground.
G is a horizontal distance [`d_A = `] [`[$dA]`] [`m`] from A while it is a horizontal distance [`d_B = `] [`[$dB]`] [`m`] from B.  

[`a =`] [____]{"$ax"} [`m/s^2`]  

[`N_{A} =`] [____]{"$NA"} [`N`]  
[`N_{B} =`] [____]{"$NB"} [`N`]
