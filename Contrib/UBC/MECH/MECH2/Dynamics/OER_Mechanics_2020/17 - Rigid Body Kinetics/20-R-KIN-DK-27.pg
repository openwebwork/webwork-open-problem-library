Movers are trying to set up an art gallery. They attempt to drag a human-size statue of a soda can with 
mass [`m = `] [`[$m]`] [`kg`] by tying a rope around it. Determine if the movers can drag the statue along
the floor without it tipping if the coefficients of static friction and kinetic friction are found to be [`\mu_s = `] [`[$mu]`]
and [`\mu_k = `] [`[$muk]`], respectively. What is the maximum force the movers can apply without tipping the statue? The can
has a height of [`h = `] [`[$h]`] [`m`] and the rope is tied [`[$y]`] [`m`] off the ground.
Assume the statue to be a solid cylinder with radius [`r = `] [`[$r]`] [`m`] and constant density.
