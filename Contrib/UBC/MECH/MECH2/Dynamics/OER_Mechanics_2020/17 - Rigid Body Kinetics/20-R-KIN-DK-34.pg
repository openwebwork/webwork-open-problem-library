Mississippi Jane is at it again! She has found herself stuck on a conveyor belt with a rolling pipe - or so it seems.
The pipe is actually not there and instead to be added in during post production for the actress' safety. It is up to
you to calculate the proper physics of the pipe so that the CGI pipe may look as realistic as possible. If the pipe is
meant to have a mass of [`[$m]`] [`kg`] and a mean radius of [`[$r]`] [`m`], determine the pipe's angular acceleration
if the conveyor belt has an acceleration of [`[$a]`] [`m/s^2`]. Assume the pipe does not slip on the conveyor belt and
neglect its thickness. Which way should the conveyor be rotating for the pipe to translate towards Mississippi if she is on
the right of the pipe?
