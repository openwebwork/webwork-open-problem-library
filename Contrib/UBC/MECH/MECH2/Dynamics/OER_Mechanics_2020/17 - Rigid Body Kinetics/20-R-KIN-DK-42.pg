Your friend has just moved into a new apartment and needs help moving some furniture in. You push on a desk at an
angle [`\theta = `] [`[$theta]`][`^{\circ}`] as shown, and, by chance, apply exactly enough force to overcome static friction.
Determine the initial acceleration of the desk at this state and the normal forces at A and B. The desk has a center of gravity
at G, with a mass of [`[$m]`] [`kg`]. The coefficients of static and kinetic friction are given as [`\mu_s = `] [`[$mus]`] and 
[`\mu_k = `] [`[$muk]`] respectively.  
The desk has a length of [`[$l]`] [`m`] and a height of [`[$h]`] [`m`]. The center of gravity is located [`0.2`] [`m`] below the 
top of the desk, and the desk has 4 legs in total.
  
[`a = `] [____]{"$agx"} [`m/s^2`]  
[`N_A = `] [____]{"$NA/2"} [`N`]  
[`N_B = `] [____]{"$NB/2"} [`N`]
