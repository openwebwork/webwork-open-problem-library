BEGIN_TEXT
The figure shows an RL circuit with a voltage source as its input, and with two switches to connect and disconnect the voltage. Both switches are initially open. The switch \(1\) is then closed at time \(t = 0\), connecting the battery to the RL circuit, while switch \(2\) remains open. Now assume that time t = T, switch \(1\) is opened and switch \(2\) is closed. If T is very large, what is the current through the inductor as a function of time for \(t > T\)?
