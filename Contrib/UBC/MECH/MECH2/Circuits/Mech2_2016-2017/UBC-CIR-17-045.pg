BEGIN_TEXT

Consider the RLC circuit as shown in the figure. The voltage source is applied to the circuit at time \(t=0\) (for simplicity, imagine there is a switch, not shown, that closes at \(t = 0\)).
$PAR
\{ image( "UBC-CIR-17-045.png", width=>$width, height=>$height) \}
$PAR
If \(L = 0.45\) \(H\), \(C = 0.8\) \(\mu F\), and \(R = 1.5\) \(k\Omega\), determine if the circuit is over-damped, critically damped, or under-damped:
$PAR
\{ $mc->buttons() \}
