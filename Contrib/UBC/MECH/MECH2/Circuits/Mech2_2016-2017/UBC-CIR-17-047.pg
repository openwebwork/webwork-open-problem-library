BEGIN_TEXT

Consider the RLC circuit as shown in the figure.
$PAR
\{ image( "UBC-CIR-17-047.png", width=>$width, height=>$height) \}
$PAR
Imagine the values of \(L\), \(C\), and \(R\) are chosen to give an over-damped response (similar to that in Figure 2 of the lab manual). Consider the slow-decay and fast-decay time constants for this circuit (refer to Equation 1 in the lab manual if necessary) and identify a rule of thumb about the settling time of the circuit, assuming that the voltage is measured across the resistor, \(V_R\).
$PAR
Hint: Settling time is the time that the circuit reaches very close to its steady-state value, where the transient response is almost vanished.
$PAR
Note: you may wish to use MATLAB or Excel to plot several test cases and determine which time constant most strongly determines the form of the overall response.
$PAR
