BEGIN_TEXT

Consider the RLC circuit as shown in the figure.

$PAR
\{ image( "UBC-CIR-17-048.png", width=>$width, height=>$height) \}
$PAR

If \(L = $L\) \(H\) and \(C = $C\) \(\mu F\), determine the value of \(R\) (in ohms) for which the circuit is critically damped.

$PAR

\(R=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(\Omega\)
