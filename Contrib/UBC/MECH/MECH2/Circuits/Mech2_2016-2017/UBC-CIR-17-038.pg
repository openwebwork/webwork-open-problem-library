BEGIN_TEXT

The figure shows an RL circuit with a voltage source as its input, and with two switches to connect and disconnect the voltage. Both switches are initially open. The switch \(1\) is then closed at time t = 0, connecting the battery to the R: circuit, while switch \(2\) remains open. What is the voltage across the inductor as a function of time? (hint: start by writing KVL around the circuit.)
