BEGIN_TEXT
Consider an RLC circuit with the critically damped response as shown in the figure. The expression for the voltage across the resistor is given in Equation 3 in the lab manual. What is the relationship between the time constant, tau, in Equation 3 and the time where the voltage reaches a maximum, \(t_{max}\), in the figure? (Hint: start by solving for the time when \(V_R\) reaches a maximum.)
