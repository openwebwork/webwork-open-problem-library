BEGIN_TEXT
Now consider the new circuit shown below. The voltage supply \(Vs\) gives a square wave by switching between \(+$V\) \(V\) and \(-$V\) \(V\) every \(T\) seconds. Determine the time constant for the circuit shown. The time constant is the time for the current through the inductor to fall by \(63.2%\) (that is, \(1 - 1/e\)). This is the same as the time for the voltage across the resistor to fall by \(63.2%\) of the supply voltage change. Assume \(V\) varies between \(+/-$V\) volts, \(R = $R\) \(k\Omega\), and \(L = $L\) \(H\). Give your answer in milliseconds.
