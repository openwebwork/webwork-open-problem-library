This question makes use of your personal data set, that has been worked on over the duration of the course. The data will appear here again $BBOLD (\{ htmlLink($local_url, "Download the csv file here") \}) $EBOLD, although this is the same personal data file that you have been working with on previous assignments in the course. Recall, that the end goal of this analysis is to estimate the effect of smoking on FEV. We would like to remove any confounding from this relationship, although we are only building up to that at the moment.
$PAR

$BBOLD Part (a) (WebWorkiR) $EBOLD
Conduct an appropriate parametric hypothesis test, to test if there is a statistically significant relationship between Smoking and FEV. Report the p-value for this test, as a decimal rounded to 4 decimal places.
\{ ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) (On-Paper) $EBOLD
Based on the test conducted in part (a), as well as producing an appropriate plot for examining the relationship between Smoking and FEV, what can you say about the relationship between Smoking and FEV? Does this seem counterintuitive in any way?
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) (On-Paper) $EBOLD
Produce a plot to examine the relationship between Smoking and Age, along with any sort of analysis you deem appropriate. Comment on any apparent relationship between Smoking and Age.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) (On-Paper) $EBOLD
Produce only a plot to examine the relationship between Age and FEV. Comment on any apparent relationship between Age and FEV.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) (On-Paper) $EBOLD
Draw a diagram that summarizes the relationship between Smoking, Age and FEV. If two variables are associated, connect them using a line. If you believe that the association has a direction (e.g., changes in X1 influence X2 to change), add an arrow head to the line to indicate the direction of the association. Based on the drawing of this diagram, can you comment on why
you believe you may have observed the relationship you did in
part (a)?
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (f) (WebWorkiR) $EBOLD
Conduct an appropriate parametric hypothesis test, to test if there is a statistically significant relationship between Gender and FEV. Report the p-value for this test, as a decimal rounded to 4 decimal places.
\{ ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (g) (On-Paper) $EBOLD
Does there appear to be any relationship between Caesarean and FEV? You may answer using a plot, or by using a hypothesis test, or numerical summaries.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (h) (On-Paper) $EBOLD
$BBOLD BONUS $EBOLD: In part (e), you likely identified some of the issues with interpreting the relationship between Smoking and FEV, given what is happening with the Age variable. Consider options for examining the relationship between Smoking and FEV, while removing the bias that Age is introducing. You may consider comparing plots or numeric summaries, stratified for different age groups (e.g. for only 15 year olds, and then only 16 year olds, and so on). You may also try more advanced methods we have not yet discussed. There are no right/expected answers from you here, this is your chance to come up with ideas and explore them. You can watch R Tutorials 1.6, 1.7 and 2.8 for some help on how you 
can stratify data and make plots of different strata.
