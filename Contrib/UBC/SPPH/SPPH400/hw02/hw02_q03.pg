$BBOLD Student Info: $EBOLD You will be working with this data set over the duration of the course.  On each subsequent assignment, you will work with this dataset, and take the analysis one step further.  At the end of the course, you will write a brief report on your analysis.  While you will have access to this dataset in WebWorkiR for each assignment, it is a good idea to save a copy of it, as well as any progress you make in analyzing the dataset over the course.  You can consult the R tutorials (\{ htmlLink("www.youtube.com/marinstatlectures", "www.youtube.com/marinstatlectures") \}) , if you like, to learn more about handy ways of being able to reproduce analyses (Writing Scripts), as well as ways of organizing your work (Working Directories, etc.)

$BBOLD Data Description: $EBOLD The data come from a cross-section of youths aged 3-19 years old, living in East Boston, in the mid-1970's.  The survey consists of self-reported data.  The dataset contains six variables: "Caesarean" is an indicator of whether or not the child was born via caesarean-section (0=no, 1=yes), "Age" recorded in years, "Gender" (0=female, 1=male), "Smoke" is an indicator if the child identifies themselves as a smoker (0=no, 1=yes), "Height" recorded in inches, and "FEV" is forced expiratory volume with units of Litres, a numeric measure of lung capacity.
$BR
$BR
Our main question of interest will be the effect of smoking on lung capacity.  Along the way, we will discuss many concepts, such as confounding, effect modification, etc.  We will also discuss limitations of the data, such as self-reported data, cross-sectional data, etc.
