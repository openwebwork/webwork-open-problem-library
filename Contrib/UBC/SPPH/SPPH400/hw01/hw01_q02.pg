## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects (Required)

Context("Numeric");

my $hash = crypt($studentLogin, 'a1');
# warn("crypt: $hash");
@nums = (0..9,'a'..'z','A'..'Z');
my %nums = map { $nums[$_] => $_ } 0..$#nums;
my $seed = 0;
$seed = $seed * 62 + $nums{$_} foreach split(//, substr($hash, -5, 5));
# warn("seed: " . $seed);

rserve_eval("set.seed($seed)");
## do not need to download data
@data = rserve_eval('
# this is to generate the values for question 2
MEANsbp <- sample(size=1, 118:122)
SDsbp <- sample(size=1, 22:26)
N <- sample(size=1, 35:70)

### this is to find solutions for Q2
# part (a)
a <- round(pnorm(140, mean=MEANsbp, sd=SDsbp, lower.tail=F), 3)
# part (b) 
b <- round( round(pnorm(160, mean=MEANsbp, sd=SDsbp, lower.tail=F), 3)/round(pnorm(140, mean=MEANsbp, sd=SDsbp, lower.tail=F), 3), 3)
# part (d)
d <- round(qnorm(0.9, mean=MEANsbp, sd=SDsbp, lower.tail=T), 1)
# part (e)
e <- round(pnorm(117, mean=MEANsbp, sd=(SDsbp/sqrt(N)), lower.tail=T), 3)

Let us assume that it is known that the systolic blood pressure (SBP) for a particular population of individuals is approximately normally distributed with a mean of $data[0] mmHg with a known standard deviation of  $data[1] mmHg. We will assume the previous to be true. Use this information to answer the following.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
($BBOLD WebWorkiR $EBOLD) An individual with a SBP of 140 or more is classified as hypertensive. What percentage of individuals in this population are hypertensive? Please submit your answer as a proportion rounded to 3 decimal places. \{ ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
($BBOLD WebWorkiR $EBOLD) A SBP of 160 or more is classified as Stage II Hypertension, while a SBP of 140-159.9 is classified as Stage I Hypertension. Of all individuals who are classified as hypertensive (Stage I or II), what percentage are Stage II Hypertensive? Please report your answer as a proportion rounded to 3 decimal places. \{ ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
($BBOLD WebWorkiR $EBOLD) What is the median SBP for this population? \{ ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) $EBOLD
($BBOLD WebWorkiR $EBOLD) What is the \(90^{th}\) percentile of SBP for this population. Please report your answer rounded to one decimal place.\{ ans_rule(7) \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) $EBOLD
($BBOLD WebWorkiR $EBOLD) Suppose an independent random sample of  $data[2] individuals is chosen from this population. What is the probability that the sample mean SBP for these $data[2] individuals is less than or equal to 117mmHg? Please report your answer as a proportion rounded to 3 decimal places. \{ ans_rule(7) \}
