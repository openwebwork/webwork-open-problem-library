## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects (Required)
# this is to create the Contraceptives.csv file for ASSGT 4
# the data will have "OC" (random) users of oral contraceptives
# the data will have "noOC" (random) non-users of oral contraceptives
# the data will have "OC.MI" (random) users of oral contraceptives
# who develop myocardial infarction
# the data will have "noOC.MI" (random) non-users of oral contraceptives
# who develop myocardial infarction
# these will then be put into a dataframe, saved as "Contraceptives.csv"

This assignment will be submitted in two parts.  Some answers will be submitted directly to the online homework system, and these questions will include a note saying $BBOLD (WebWorkiR) $EBOLD at the start.  Other questions will be submitted on paper, in class.  These questions will include a note saying $BBOLD (On-Paper) $EBOLD at the start.
$BR
$BR
A study looked at the effect of oral contraceptive (OC) use on heart disease
(MI=myocardial infarction) in women aged 40-44. Researchers followed a
cohort of women who used oral contraceptives as well as a group who did
not use oral contraceptives, following them for a 3-year period. Use of oral
contraceptives was assumed to not change over the duration of study. The file $BBOLD Contraceptives.csv  (\{ htmlLink($local_url, "Download the csv file here") \}) $EBOLD contains data for this study. The variable OC.use is an indicator for oral contraceptive use, with 1 indicating the subject used oral contraceptives. The variable MI.occur is an indicator for evidence of myocardial infarction, with 1 indicating occurrence of myocardial infarction.
$PAR

Use the data to answer the following questions.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
The required percentage is $q1ans%. 
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
The answer is YES.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
The percentage of women who developed an MI within a 3-year period and used OCs is $q3ans%.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) $EBOLD
The answer is NO.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) $EBOLD
Both a mosaic plot and side-by-side bar charts are appropriate.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (f) $EBOLD
No, one cannot tell from the plot alone.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (g) $EBOLD
The two-proportion t-test, Pearsons Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and the test for OR = 1 are all applicable.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (h) $EBOLD
Depending which test is chosen to perform the p-value will be one of: $q81ans (Chi-squared test with continuity correction), $q82ans (Chi-squared test with no continuity correction), $q83ans (Fisher's exact test), $q84ans (two-proportion t-test).
$BR
$BBOLD Part (i) $EBOLD
If the p-value in (h) is less than 0.05, then there is a statistically significant relationship; otherwise, no such conclusion could be drawn.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (j) $EBOLD
The RD value is $q10ans%. 
$BR
$BBOLD Part (k) $EBOLD
The risk ratio is $q11ans.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (l) $EBOLD
The odds ratio is $q12ans.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (m) $EBOLD
