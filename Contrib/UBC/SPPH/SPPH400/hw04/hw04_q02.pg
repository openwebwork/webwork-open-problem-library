$BBOLD Part (a) (On-Paper) $EBOLD 
Following a similar process as you worked through in question 1, analyze the relationship between Gender and Smoking, based on your analysis of this data. Write up a report no longer than one page including any plots/tables/summaries, summarizing the relationship between Gender and Smoking. You may want to comment on the significance of any association, as well as comment on some measures of strength and direction of association. Include any information you think is relevant, and exclude anything you think is not relevant.
