#  Setup


$mc2 = new_multiple_choice();
$mc2->qa(
" ", 
"Solidification of the two solid phases involves atomic diffusion; since the process occurs across a single temperature point, alternating layers are produced because the diffusion path length is minimal"
);
$mc2->extra(
"The two solid phases produced from solidification of an alloy with eutectic composition have drastically different chemical compositions.",
"Solidification of an alloy with eutectic composition is diffusion-dependent and occurs at a single temperature",
"The solidification process is dependent upon physical rearrangement of atoms across small length scales",

BEGIN_PGML
Which of the following statements *best* *explains* why equilibrium cooling of a liquid alloy of eutectic composition beyond the eutectic temperature yields a microstructure consisting of alternating layers of two solid phases
[@ $mc2 -> print_q() @]***  
[@ $mc2 -> print_a() @]***
