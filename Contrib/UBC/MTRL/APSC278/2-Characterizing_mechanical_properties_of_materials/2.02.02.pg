In a materials engineering lab, uniaxial tensile tests were performed on two different materials: brass (65% Cu – 35% Zn) and 1018 steel (0.18% C). All samples were non-standard, and had a 20 mm gauge length and 3 mm diameter. The load versus elongation plots were generated from the tests and used to determine the Young’s modulus of both materials. However, the values determined from analysis of experimental data were found to be lower than the actual values of Young’s modulus for brass and steel. Which of the following statements BEST describes a plausible explanation for this discrepancy?
