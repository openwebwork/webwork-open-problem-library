A non-standard sample of brass was used for a uniaxial tensile test and was machined to have a gauge length of $initial_length mm. Based on data obtained from the uniaxial tensile test, the Youngâ€™s Modulus of the sample was found to be $Youngs_modulus GPa. During testing, it was observed that the sample began to plastically deform at a stress of $Yield_stress MPa. Calculate the elongation of the sample at the yield point.
