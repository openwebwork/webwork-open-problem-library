#  Setup


$mc2 = new_multiple_choice();
$mc2->qa(
"Which of the following statements about recrystallization and grain growth is incorrect?", 
"Annealing heat treatment can increase the ductility and yield strength of a strain hardened material to its original state"
);
$mc2->extra(
"Strain hardening increases the internal energy within a material, thereby increasing the driving force for recovery and recrystallization",
"At elevated temperatures of annealing heat treatment, dislocations are reconfigured such that stored energy in the material is released ",
"Increasing the annealing temperature decreases the time required for recrystallization to be complete",
);
