$BR $BR
Steel with near eutectoid composition and pearlite microstructure is often used in the construction of railway rails due to its good wear resistance. Two steel samples have the same composition (0.76 wt% carbon, eutectoid composition) and have been cooled from an austenite phase. Sample A is cooled rapidly and sample B is cooled more slowly. $BR
i. Assuming that the final microstructure is pearlite, which of the following conclusions can be made?      $BR
\{ $q_1->buttons() \}
$BR
$BR
Which of the steel samples described above has higher strength, and why?    $BR
\{ $q_2->buttons() \}
