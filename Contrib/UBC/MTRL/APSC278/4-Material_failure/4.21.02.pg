The following shows the possible oxidation and reduction reactions that occur when magnesium is immersed into three different solutions under unique conditions (i, ii, iii).  Of the three scenarios presented, which would result in the highest rate of oxidation-reduction?  $BR
$BR
(i) HCl solution $BR
\(Mg → Mg^{2+} + 2e^-\)  $BR  
\(2H^{+} + 2e^- → H_2\) $BR $BR
(ii) HCl solution containing dissolved oxygen $BR
\(Mg → Mg^{2+} + 2e^-\)   $BR
\(4H^{+} + O_2 + 4e^- → 2H_2O\) $BR $BR
(iii) HCl solution containing dissolved oxygen; the temperature of the solution is highest $BR
\(Mg → Mg^{2+} + 2e^-\) $BR 
\(4H^{+} + O_2 + 4e^- → 2H_2O\) $BR $BR
