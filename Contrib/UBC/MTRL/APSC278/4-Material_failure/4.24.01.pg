"In noble coating, a more chemically active metal layer than the primary metal acts as a physical barrier to inhibit contact with water and oxygen.",

"For some metals and alloys, an oxide coating forms upon initial exposure to oxygen. The oxide layer further accelerates corrosion, acting as an active layer.",
