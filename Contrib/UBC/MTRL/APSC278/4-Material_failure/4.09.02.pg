Three identical fatigue specimens (A, B, and C) are fabricated from a nonferrous alloy. Each specimen is subjected to one of the maximum-minimum stress cycles, as defined below. Assuming that the loading frequency is the same for all three tests, rank the fatigue lifetimes of the three specimens from the longest to the shortest.
