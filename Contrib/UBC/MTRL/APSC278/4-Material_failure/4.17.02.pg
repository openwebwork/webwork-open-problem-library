The figure below shows the change in creep strain versus time for four different components subjected to constant stress at elevated temperatures. Assume that the four components have the same chemical composition, but the temperature and stress conditions each are subjected to are unknown. Indicate whether each statement below is PLAUSIBLE (true) or IMPLAUSIBLE (false)?  $BR
