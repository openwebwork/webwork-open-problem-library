$mc2 = new_multiple_choice();
$mc2->qa(
"Which of the following statements about fatigue failure is correct?", 
"Fatigue failure can occur at stresses below the yield strength of a material as a result of imperfections that act as stress raisers (stress concentration points)"
);
$mc2->extra(
"Some materials exhibit a fatigue limit, the stress amplitude below which fatigue failure will always occur",
"Shot Peening is a treatment that strengthens a material by altering the chemical composition of the surface layer",
"Case hardening is an example of a surface treatment that can decrease the fatigue life of a specimen for a given stress amplitude"
