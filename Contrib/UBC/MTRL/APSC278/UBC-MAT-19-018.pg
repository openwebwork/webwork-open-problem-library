BEGIN_PGML
Two brass specimens of the same chemical composition undergo the Charpy impact test. Whereas one of the specimens is tested at room temperature, the other is held in liquid nitrogen prior to testing. In both tests, the hammer (mass [`[$mass]`] `Kg`) swung from an initial height of `0.9 m` from the ground, before impacting the specimen. After impact, the hammer rose to a new height of [`[$height1]`] `m` for specimen `1` and [`[$height2]`] `m` for specimen `2`. Take the acceleration due to gravity [`g\;=\;9.81`] [`ms^2`].

*Part (a)*  
What is the difference in energy absorbed between specimen `1` and `2`?  
Energy Difference = [_____]{"$energy_diff"}[`J`]    

*Part (b)*  
Which of the specimens (`1` or `2`) was placed in liquid nitrogen prior to testing?  
Specimen [_____]{"$ans"}
