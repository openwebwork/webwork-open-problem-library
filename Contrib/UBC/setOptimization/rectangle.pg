SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION') );
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
If \(x\) and \(y\) are the side lengths then we know \(xy = $a\).
$BR Perimeter can be expressed as a function of both \(x\) and \(y\): \(f(x,y) = 2x+2y\).
$BR Using the equation for area we find that: \(f(x) = \frac{2x^2+$a2}{x}\).
$PAR
We can find max/min values by solving for \(x\) when \(f'(x) =0\).
$BR \(f'(x) = \frac{2x^2-$a2}{x^2}\)
$BR \(x^2 = $a\)
$BR \(x = $c\)

$PAR

You should also check that this value is a minimum.  
$BR It is easy to check that \(f'(x)\) is negative when \(x < $c\) and positive when \(x > $c\).
$BR Therefore, \(x=$c\) represents a minimum.

$PAR Therefore the minimum perimeter is \(f($c) = $c4\).

$PAR
ALTERNATE SOLUTION (NO CALCULUS!) $BR
This is a sketch of a geometric proof to this question.  Don't worry if you don't understand it. $PAR
Consider the broader question of what is the minimum perimeter of all quadrilaterals with a fixed area.
$BR First consider a line tangent to an ellipse and perpendicular to its minor axis.  Place two points of the quadrilateral on the foci of the ellipse and a third anywhere on the line.  As long as that third point is on the line, the triangle that is formed will have a constant area.  On the other hand if that third point was on any point on the ellipse, the triangle would have a constant perimeter.  To minimize perimeter with a constant area, the third point must be where the line intersects the ellipse, which is equal distance from the other two points.  If this were not the case, the third point would be outside the ellipse, and the triangle would have a greater perimeter.  By induction this must be true for any other combination of points from the quadrilateral.  Therefore all the points must be equal distance from each other, which only happens if it is a square.
