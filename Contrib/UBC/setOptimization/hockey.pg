BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the demand for tickets to see a specific hockey team play.  The price of the ticket can be related to the quantity demanded (q) by the function: \(p=$a-$b q\).  When the arena is not close to full capacity the total cost can be expressed by the function: \(Cost=$c q + 5,000,000\). 

$PAR

Find marginal revenue (MR) as  a function of quantity demanded.
$BR \(MR = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

Let \(p^*\) and \(q^*\) be the price and quantity demanded where profit is maximized.
$BR \(p^* =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $SPACE \(q^* = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR

The hockey players union has negotiated a deal requiring the team owner to pay an extra $1,000,000 a year in salaries to the players.  What should the new ticket price (\(p_1\)) be to ensure that profit is maximized.

$BR \(p_1 = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION') );
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Total revenue will be the price of the ticket multiplied by the number of tickets sold. Therefore, \(TR = q($a-$b q)\).  Marginal revenue will be the derivative of this function: \(MR = $a - $b2 q\).  Note that this function has the same y-intercept as the demand function, but with twice the slope.

$PAR

The marginal cost is just the derivative of the total cost: \(MC = $c\).  

$PAR

Profit is maximized when marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
$BR \($a-$b2 q=$c\)
$BR \(q = $q\)
$BR Therefore \(p = $p\).

$PAR

Increasing the players salary will not affect the marginal cost of providing more tickets, so it will not effect the profit maximizing price.  This is an interesting result.  All else being equal a salary increase should not affect the price you pay to see sports games.
