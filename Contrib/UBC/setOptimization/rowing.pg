A boat on the the ocean is \($a\) km from the nearest point on a straight shoreline; that point is \($b\) km from a restaurant on the shore.  A woman plans to row the boat straight to a point on the shore and then walk along the shore to the restaurant.  If she walks at 5 km/h and rows at 4 km/h.  How far will the point on shore be from the restaurant if she plans to minimize her total travel time?

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
If \(x\) is the distance from the nearest point on shore to the boat to where the woman lands, and \(f(x)\) describes the total travel time.
      $BR \[f(x) = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{$a2+x^2}+\frac{1}{5}($b-x), 0 \leq x \leq $b\]
$BR \(f'(x) = \frac{5x-4\sqrt{$a2+x^2}}{20\sqrt{$a2+x^2}}\).  To find min/max values we set this equal to \(0\).
$PAR
\(4\sqrt{$a2+x^2}=5x\) $BR
\(16($a2+x^2)=25x^2\) $BR
\($a2c2 = 9x^2\) $BR
\(x^2 = \frac{$a2c2}{9}\) $BR
\(x= $c4\) $SPACE Since \(x \geq 0\).

$PAR
Now we must evaluate \(f(x)\) at this value and at the endpoints.
$BR \(f(0) = $f0\)
$BR \(f($c4) = $fx\)
$BR \(f($b) = $fb\)

$PAR
Therefore, \(f(x)\) is minimized when \(x=$x\).  And the distance from where the woman lands to the restaurent is \($ans\) km.
