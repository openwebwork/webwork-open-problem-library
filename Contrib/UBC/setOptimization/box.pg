A carpenter has been asked to build an open box with a square base, where an open 
box means a box without a top. The sides of the box will cost $$b per square meter, and the 
base will cost $$c per square meter. What are the dimensions of the box of maximal volume 
that can be constructed for $$a ?

$PAR

If \(x\) is the length of one of the sides of the base and \(z\) is the height of the box.  Find a function \(f(x)\) for the volume of the box. $BR $BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD The function should just be in terms of \(x\).

$BR \(f(x) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

Let \(x^*\) and \(z^*\) be the dimensions that maximize the volume of the box.
$BR \(x^* = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR \(z^* = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The total surface area of the sides is: \(4xz\), and the surface area of the base is: \(x^2\).  Therefore the total cost of construction can be expressed as: \($a = $b4 xz+$c x^2\).  Solving for \(z\) and subbing into the equation for volume we get:
$BR \(f(x) = \frac{$a x - $c x^3}{$b4}\).

$PAR
We can find max/min values by solving for \(x\) when \(f'(x) =0\).
$BR \(f'(x) = \frac{$a-9x^2}{$b4}\)
$BR \(0= \frac{$a-9x^2}{$b4}\)
$BR \(x = $x\).

$PAR

You should also check that this value is a maximum.  
$BR \(f''(x) = -\frac{3 x}{$b23}\), which is always negative (since \(x\) is positive), so \(f($x)\) is a local maximum.
