Suppose that a when a cell phone store charges \($c\)$ for a car charger, it sells \($a\) units.  When it drops the price to \($c1\)$ it sells \($ab\) units.  Assume that demand is a linear function of price.  If each phone charger costs \($d\)$ to make, what price should the store charge to maximize its profit?

$PAR

If \(x\) is the number of times the price is reduced by one dollar.  Find a function for total profit with respect to \(x\).  A negative value for \(x\) will mean the price is increased.
$BR \(f(x) =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

Price to maximize profit \(=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Total number of units sold can be expressed by: \(($a+$b x)\).  The price per unit is expressed by: \(($c-x)\).  Therefore total revenue is: \(TR = ($a+$b x)($c-x)\).
$BR Total cost is a function of total units sold: \(C=$d($a-$b x)\) dollars per unit, the profit function is: 
$BR \(f(x) = ($a+$b x)($c-x) - $d($a+$b x)\)
$BR \(= -$b2 x^2 +$sol x +$acda\)

$PAR
We can find max/min values by solving for \(x\) when \(f'(x) =0\).
$BR \(f'(x) = $sol - $b2 x\)
$BR \(0= $sol - $b2 x\)
$BR \(x = $x\).

$PAR

You should also check that this value is a maximum.  
$BR \(f''(x) = -$b2\), which is always negative, so \(f($x)\) is a local maximum.
$PAR
To find the price where profit is maximized, we need to go back to the price function: \($c-x = $c-$x=$cx\).
$BR Therefore price should be set at \($cx \) dollars.
