An electronics store expects to sell $d TVs at a steady rate next year. The manager 
of the store plans to order these TVs from the manufacturer by placing several orders of 
the same size spaced equally throughout the year. The ordering cost for each delivery is 
$$k for the setup costs and $$p per TV. The carrying costs, based on the average number of TVs in inventory, amount to $$h per year for one TV. 

$PAR
If \(C(x)\) is the inventory cost (which is the sum of the ordering costs and the carrying costs) and \(x\) is the $BBOLD number of TVs in each order $EBOLD.
$BR \(C(x) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
How many TVs the manager should request each time she places an order to minimize the inventory cost? \{ans_rule(10)\}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION') );
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The total number of orders needed is: \(\left(\frac{$d}{x}\right)\).  Since the cost per TV in the shipment does not depend on the size of the shipment, the total shipment cost is: \(\left($k\frac{$d}{x} + $pd\right)\).  The average number of TVs in the inventory will be half of the shipment size, so the total carrying cost will be: \(\left($h\frac{x}{2}\right)\).

$PAR Therefore: \(C(x) = \frac{$dk}{x} + $pd + $h2 x\).

$PAR
We can find max/min values by solving for \(x\) when \(C'(x) =0\).
$BR \(C'(x) = \frac{$h x^2 - $dk2}{x^2}\)
$BR \(x^2= \frac{$dk2}{$h}\)
$BR \(x = $rule\).

$PAR

You now need to check \(C(x)\) at this value, as well as at the end points (\(x=1,$d\)).
$BR \(C(1) = $f1\)
$BR \(C($d) = $fd\)
$BR \(C($rule) = $fx\)

$PAR Therefore the shipment size should be \($x\) TVs.
