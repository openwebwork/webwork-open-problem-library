BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the following function:

$PAR  \[f(x) = \begin{cases}
         $f1 & x \leq 1 \\
         $f2 &  x > 1\\
       \end{cases}\] 
$PAR
Find a value of \(a\) such that the function is differentiable everywhere.  If no such value of \(a\) exists, enter '\(DNE\)'.
$BR \(a = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

$ans = $ans1; $equal = "="; $dif = "is";}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The only problem spot is at \(x=1\).  First we have to find a value of \(a\) such that \(f(x)\) is continuous.  

$BR We need: \(\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = f(1)\)
$PAR \(\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1^-}  f(x) = $abc\)

$PAR \(\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = a + $d\)

$PAR Therefore: \(a = $abc - $d = $ans\)

$PAR Next find a value of \(a\) such that the right and left side derivatives are the same at \(x=1\).  If these two values are not the same \(f(x)\) can never be differentiable at \(x=1\).  

$PAR 
Right side derivative: \(\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h} = a = $ans\)
$BR Left side derivative: \(\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h} = $ans1\)

$PAR Since \(a = $ans $equal $ans1\), \(f(x)\) $dif differentiable at \(x = 1\)

$PAR The correct answer is \(a = $ans\)
