Consider the function \(f(x) = $f\) and the point \(A($d,$c)\).
$PAR
\(f'(x) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Find a formula for the slope of a line passing through point \(A\), and an arbitrary point on the function.  Your answer should be a formula in terms of \(x\).
$BR
\(slope = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Using your answers from the two previous questions, find the slope(s) of the line(s) through point \(A\) that is (are) tangent to \(f(x)\).  If there is more than one line you can separate your answers with a comma (ex. $BBOLD 5,2 $EBOLD).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Solve for the derivative using basic rules of differentiation. 
$BR\(f'(x)=$df\).  

$PAR You can find the slope function in the second part of the question using \(slope = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\).  
$BR \(slope = \frac{x^2+$a x+$b -$c}{x-$d}\)
$BR \( = $slope\).  

$PAR For the last part, Set the derivative function equal to the slope function.  Solve for \(x\) and evaluate the derivative at the values that you find.  
$BR \($df = $slope\)
$BR \((2x+$a)(x-$d) = x^2+$a x\)
$BR \(2x^2 + $da x - $ad = x^2 + $a x\)
$BR \(0 = x^2 + $d2a x - $ad\)
$BR \(\displaystyle x = \frac{-$d2a \pm \sqrt{ ($d2a)^2+4($ad)}}{2}\)
$BR \(x = $x1,$x2\)

$PAR Therefore, the lines through point \(A\) are tangent to \(f(x)\) when \(x=$x1\), and \(x=$x2\).  $BR When you evaluate the derivative at these points, you find that the lines have slopes \($ans1\) and \($ans2\).
