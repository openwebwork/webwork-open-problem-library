$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We don't need to calculate an EAR.
$BR We know that \(r_A = (1+r_m)^{12} - 1\)
$BR Therefore: \(r_m = (r_A+1)^{\frac{1}{12}}-1\), and the monthly rate is $month%.

$PAR
From the equation for mortgage and loan calculations we know that:
$BR \(Y = -\frac{P (r_m)}{(1+r_m)^{-N}-1}\),
$BR \(= -\frac{$p ($a)}{(1+$a)^{-$n}-1}\),
$BR \(=  $p.\)

$PAR
To find the total interest paid you need to calculate the total value of your payments and subtract the initial value of loan.
$BR \(Interest = N(Y) - P\),
$BR \(= $n ($y1) -$p\),
$BR\(= $ti1.\)

First we need to calculate an EAR.
$BR Since there are $per compounding periods per year we know that \(EAR = ((1+\frac{$r}{$per})^{$per}-1)100%\).
$BR \(EAR = $goodear%.\)

$PAR Now we need to calculate the corresponding monthly rate.  We know that \(r_A = (1+r_m)^{12}\)
Therefore: \(r_m = (r_A)^{\frac{1}{12}}-1\), and the monthly rate is $month%.
