BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We have \(\ln(x) = 4-x\), so \(0 = \ln(x) +x-4 \).

$PAR If \(f(x) = \ln(x)+x-4\), then \(f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}+1\).

$PAR
Newton's Method says:
\(x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\)
\( = x_n - \frac{ln(x_n)+x_n-4 }{\frac{1}{x_n}+1}\)

$BR \(x_1 = $ans[1]\)
$BR \(x_2 = $ans[2]\)
$BR \(x_3 = $ans[3]\).
