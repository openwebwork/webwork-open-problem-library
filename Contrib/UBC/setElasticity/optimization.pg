SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Total revenue is given by \(R = p Q(p)\).  Using the product rule we find \(MR = Q+\frac{dq}{dp} p\).
Rearranging the equation for elasticity we get \(\frac{dq}{dp} p = - Q E\).  Plugging back into the equation for
\(MR\), we get \(MR = Q (1-E)\).  When \(E >1\),  \(MR<0\)., when \(E<1\),  \(MR>0\), and when \(E = 1\),  \(MR = 0\). 
$PAR Therefore, revenue is maximized when the price is set such that \(E=1\).  This analysis also provides a mathematical explanation of why the price will never be set in the elastic portion of the demand curve.
