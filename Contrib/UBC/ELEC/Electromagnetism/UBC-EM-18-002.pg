Three identical small spheres are placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle on a horizontal, smooth surface. As shown in the figure, the three spheres are tied to each other by three identical insulating springs. These three springs have the characteristic constant of [`k = [$k]`] [`N/m`]. The radius of each sphere is very small compared to the distance between the spheres, so they may be treated as three points. When the springs are at equilibrium (i.e. not stretched), the distance between the spheres is [`l_o = [$lo]`] [`cm`]. Applying the same amount of charge [`+Q`] on each sphere, the area of the equilateral triangle expands to [`[$n]`] times of its original size at equilibrium. Now a infinite uniform line of charges is placed in the center of the triangle and is normal to the surface. Find the charge density [`\rho_L`] that makes the triangle return back to its original size at equilibrium.

[`\rho_L=`] [______]{"$rhoL"} [`\mu C/m`]
