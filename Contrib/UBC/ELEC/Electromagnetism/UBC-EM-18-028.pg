As shown in Fig. (a), a spherical capacitor is made of two thin concentric shells.
The inner shell has radius [`R_1 = [$R1]\,`]m and the outer shell has radius [`R_4 = [$R4]\,`]m. 
The inner shell ([`r=R_1`]) has total charge [`Q = [$Q]\,\mu`]C, 
uniformly distributed. 
Assume that the space between the inner and outer shells has 
permittivity [`\epsilon = \epsilon_0`]. 
Answer the following questions:

*a)* Find the capacitiance between [`R_1`] and [`R_4`], as shown in Fig. (a).

	[`C=`] [__________________________________________________] pF 

*b)* As shown in Fig. (b), another thin spherical conducting shell is placed at [`r = R_2 = [$R2]\,`]m, with [`R_1<R_2<R_4`].
Taking the result from part *a)* for reference, 
will this new shell make the capacitance between [`r=R_1`] and [`r=R_4`]
increase, decrease, or stay the same?
[@ $mcEqual->menu() @]*

*c)* What is the total capacitance between [`r=R_1`] and [`r=R_4`] in part *b)*?

	[`C=`] [__________________________________________________] pF 

*d)* As shown in Fig. (c), instead of a thin shell, 
a thick conducting shell defined by [`R_2 \le r \le R_3`] is introduced,
where [`R_1<R_2<R_3<R_4`]; in detail, [`R_2 = [$R2]\,`]m and 
[`R_3 = [$R3]\,`]m. 
Taking the result from part *a)* for reference, 
will introducing this new shell make the capacitance between [`r=R_1`] and [`r=R_4`]
increase, decrease, or stay the same?
[@ $mcGreater->menu() @]*

*e)* What is the total capacitance between [`r=R_1`] and [`r=R_4`] in part *d)*?
