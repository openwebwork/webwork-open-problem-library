The instantaneous rate of change of the value of a certain investment (P) is proportional to its value.  That is to say \(\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\).  

$PAR

If \(r= $r\) and \(P(0) = $p\):
$PAR \(P(t) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We can make an educated guess that the solution has to be of the form: \(P(t) = Ae^{rt}\) for some \(A\).  You can easily check that this guess is valid: \(P'(t) = rAe^{r t}= rP(t)\).  

$PAR We know that \(P(0) = $p\), so \($p = A\).

$PAR Therefore: \(P(t) = $p e^{r t}\).

$PAR This is actually the formula for the value of an investment growing at a $r% interest rate compounded continuously.
