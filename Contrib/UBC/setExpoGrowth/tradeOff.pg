Say you buy an house as an investment for $a$ (assume that you did not need a mortgage).  You estimate that the house will increase in value continuously by $b$ per year.  At any time in the future you can sell the house and invest the money in a fund with a yearly interest rate of $rate% compounded $per.

$PAR

If you want to maximize your return, after how many years should you sell the house?  Report your answer to 1 decimal place.

$PAR

\(years = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

There are a couple of ways to approach this question.  I solved it by first computing an effective annual interest rate.
$PAR
\(EAR = (1+\frac{$r}{$n})^{$n}-1\).
$BR \(EAR = $smallEar\).

$PAR

Now you can determine how much interest you would get if you sold the house and invested the money.
$PAR
\(INTEREST = $smallEar($a+$b t)\) , where t is in years.

$PAR 

You need this to be equal to the yearly increase in the value of the house.

$PAR

\($smallEar($a + $b t) = $b\),
$BR \(t= \frac{$b - $smallEar($a)}{$b ($smallEar)} \),
$BR \(t = $ans \) years.

$PAR

Therefore you should wait at least $ans years before selling the house.
