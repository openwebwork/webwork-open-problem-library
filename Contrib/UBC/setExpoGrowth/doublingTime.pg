BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

First note that if the value of the investment is represented by \(f(t)\), then \(f(t) = $value e^{$r t}\).
$PAR
We need to find a \(t\) such that \(2=e^{$r t}\).
$BR By taking the logarithm of both sides we find: \(\ln(2)=$r t \ln(e)\).
$BR Therefore \(t = \frac{\ln(2)}{$r} = $answer\).

$PAR
Interestingly, if you have a growth rate of r%, then the doubling time under continuous growth is \(t=\frac{\ln(2)}{\frac{r/100}} = 100\frac{\ln(2)}{r} \approx \frac{69.3}{r}\).

$PAR

Therefore the doubling time is approximately 69 divided by the growth rate.

If \(f(t)\) is the value of the investment, then \(f(t) = $value (1+$r)^t\).

$PAR

To find the doubling time we need to find a \(t\) such that:
$BR \(2 = (1+$r)^t\).

$PAR

By taking the logarithm of both sides we find, \(t = \frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(1+$r)} \approx $answer\).

If \(f(t)\) is the value of the investment, then \(f(t) = $value (1+\frac{$r}{$n})^{$n t}\).

$PAR

To find the doubling time we need to find a \(t\) such that:
$BR \( 2 = (1+\frac{$r}{$n})^{$n t}\).

$PAR 

By taking the logarithm of both sides we find, \(t = \frac{\ln(2)}{$n \ln(1+\frac{$r}{$n})} \approx $answer\).
