Nick has lost faith in the banks, and has decided to diversify his portfolio by keeping some money under his mattress.  He decides to put  $$a under his mattress and $$c in a GIC with a $e1% annual interest rate (compounded continuously).  If there is a $b1% annual inflation rate, when will the real value of Nick's investments be at a minimum?
$PAR $BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD An inflation rate of $b1% means that the real value of money is decreasing at this rate (compounded continuously).  You should also consider what inflation does to the interest rate.

$PAR If \(I(t)\) is the total real value of the investments after \(t\) years:
$BR \(I(t) =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR If \(t^*\) is the number of years until the value of the assets is a minimum:
$BR \(t^* = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR $BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD Use at least one decimal in your answer.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION') );
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The value of the money under the mattress is: \($a e^{-$b t}\).  The real interest rate of the GIC is \($e1-$b1 = $d1\)%. Therefore the value of the GIC is: \($c e^{$d t}\)

$PAR

\(I(t) = $a e^{-$b t} + $c e^{$d t}\)

$PAR The max/min values happen when \(I'(t) = 0\).
$BR \(I'(t) = -$ab e^{-$b t} + $cd e^{$d t}\),
$BR \(0 = -$ab e^{-$b t} + $cd e^{$d t}\),
$BR \($ab e^{-$b t} = $cd e^{$d t}\),
$BR \(\ln($ab) - $b t \ln{e} = \ln($cd) + $d t \ln{e}\),
$BR \(($d+$b)t = \ln($ab) - \ln($cd)\),
$BR \(t = \frac{\ln($ab) - \ln($cd)}{$bd}\).

$PAR Therefore \(t = $ans1, t \geq 0\).

$PAR You should also that \(I($ans1)\) is a minimum in its domain.
$BR \(I''(t) = $ab2 e^{-$b t} + $cd2 e^{$d t}\), which is alway positive, so \(I($ans1)\) is a minimum.
