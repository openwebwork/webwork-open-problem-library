$BBOLD This question is for practice. No mark is attached to the question. $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

The time taken for healthy Canadian adults to complete a logic problem
is believed to have a mean 40 seconds. It is of interest to investigate whether
UBC students perform better on average than healthy adult Canadians,
so the logic problem is given to a sample of 80 UBC students, and
their times to solution are recorded. The sample mean and standard deviation are 36 seconds and 17 seconds.

Which of the following approximate the sampling distribution of the test statistic in Part d:$BR
