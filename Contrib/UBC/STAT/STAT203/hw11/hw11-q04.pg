From previous studies, it has been generally believed that Northern
Hemisphere icebergs have a mean depth of 270 meters. An environmentalist has suggested that global
warming has caused icebergs to have greater depth. A team of
scientists visiting the Northern Hemisphere observed a random sample
of 41 icebergs. The depth of the base of the iceberg below the surface
was carefully measured for each. The sample mean and standard
deviation were calculated to be 276 meters and 20 meters respectively.
