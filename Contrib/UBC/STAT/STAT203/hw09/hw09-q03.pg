A study claims that 75$PERCENT of children under the age of 13 in British Columbia have been 
vaccinated from the chicken pox. A survey of randomly selected residents of a certain city 
included 650 children who were under the age of 13, and 197 of them were not vaccinated.

What is the $BBOLD approximated $EBOLD probability that sample proportion of non-vaccinated 
children in a sample of 650 children is more than 197/650? (Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. 
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).
