$BBOLD This question is for practice. No mark is attached to the question. $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

A manufacturer of automobile batteries claims that the
distribution of the battery life has a mean of 54 months and
a standard deviation of 6 months. It is also known that the distribution 
is slightly skewed to the left. Suppose a consumer group
decides to check the claim by purchasing a sample of 50
of these batteries and subjecting them to tests that determine
their lives. Assume that the manufacturer's claim is true.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part a $EBOLD
$BR
What type of variable is the lifetime of a battery? 
$BR
\{ $popup_a->menu() \}

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part b $EBOLD
$BR
Describe the sampling distribution of the mean lifetime of a sample of 50 batteries.
$BR
\{ $popup_b->menu() \}

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part c $EBOLD
$BR
What is the probability that the consumer group's sample has a mean lifetime of 52 or fewer months?
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places. 
$BR
\{ ans_rule(6) \}

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part d $EBOLD
$BR
Within what range of values does the mean lifetime of 50 batteries have a 95% chance of falling?
Please use the 68-95-99.7 rule.
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places. 
$BR
(\{ ans_rule(6) \}, \{ ans_rule(6) \})
