When playing golf, shots from close to the hole are known as $BITALIC putts $EITALIC. For professional players, how does the chance of success at a putt depend on the distance of the ball from the hole? 
$BR
Suppose data are gathered from the Statland professional golf tour, where the number of putts taken, and holed, were recorded across all players, along with the corresponding initial distances from the hole taken to the nearest foot. The counts are given below:
$BR
$BCENTER
\[
\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}
\text{Distance from hole (feet)} & $distance \\ \hline
\text{No. putts} & $putts \\
\text{No. successful} & $holes \\
\end{array}
\]
$ECENTER
$BR
(Probabilities used to generate the data are taken from $BBOLD www.golf.com$EBOLD)
$BR
Consider a logistic regression model using the above data, linking the probability of success at a putt to the distance from the hole.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
$BR
The model fitted is of the form
\[
\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i,
\]
where \(\pi_i\) is the probability of holing for putt \(i\), and where \(x_i\) is the initial distance from the hole $BITALIC (in ft) $EITALIC for putt \(i\). The model links the probability of success at a putt to an expression involoving two parameters, \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\).
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
$BR
Rearranging the model stated above,
\[
\pi_i = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_i}} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}.
\]
Hence the estimated probability of holing from six feet is 
\[
\hat{\pi}(6) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\left(\hat{\beta}_0 + 6\hat{\beta}_1\right)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-($b0+$b1\times 6)}} = $answers[0]. 
\]
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
$BR
$letter[$inv[$k]]
$BR
This curve of the fitted probability versus the distance can be drawn with the R function $BBOLD curve $EBOLD:
$BR
$BBOLD curve(1/(1+exp(-(\($b0 + $b1\)*x))), from=3, to=10, xlab="Distance (ft)", ylab="Estimated probability") $EBOLD
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) $EBOLD
$BR
The estimated odds is 
\[
\frac{\hat{\pi}(8)}{1-\hat{\pi}(8)} = e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + 8\hat{\beta_1}} = e^{$b0 + $b1\times 8} = $answers[1].
\]
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) $EBOLD
$BR
A residual in this context can be taken to be the difference
between the observed proportion of successful putts and the probability estimated from the model. In this case, the observed residual for putts at six feet is
\[
\frac{$hole6}{$putt6} - \left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-($b0 + $b1\times 6)}}\right) = $answers[2].
\]
