Studies have indicated that how fast an elderly person walks, their $BITALIC gait speed $EITALIC (in m/s), is a good indicator of various health outcomes such as life expectancy following a heart attack.
Fiser $BITALIC et al.$EITALIC (2010) explored the relationship between gait speed and various other biometric variables in 49 elderly adults (25 men and 24 women). Variables measured included age (in years), body mass index (in kg/m\(^2\)), percentage of body fat, volume of oxygen inhaled while standing (VO\(_2\) while standing, in mL/kg/min), and peak volume of oxygen while exercising (maximal aerobic capacity, VO\(_{2peak}\), in mL/kg/min). The researchers defined "reserve VO2" as the difference between VO\(_{2peak}\) and VO\(_{2}\) during standing, the variable reflecting the capacity of increased oxygen consumption available for walking.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
$BR
There is no treatment applied to the subjects and measurements were taken without intervention. The study is purely observational.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
$BR
The response variable for the study is gait speed.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
$BR
The model can be fitted in R using the $BBOLD lm $EBOLD function, with $BITALIC GaitSpeed$EITALIC as the response variable:
$BR
$BCENTER
$BBOLD lm1 <- lm(GaitSpeed ~ Age + ResVO2)$EBOLD.
$ECENTER
The coefficient on the covariate $BITALIC Age$EITALIC in the fitted model can be obtained by $BBOLD lm1${'DOLLAR'}coef[2]$EBOLD, which is $answers[0].
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) $EBOLD
$BR
The standardized residuals of a linear regression object in R can be obtained with the function $BBOLD stres <- rstandard(lm1) $EBOLD. The largest residual absolute value can be obtained with $BBOLD max(abs(stres)) $EBOLD, which is $answers[1]. Unless the largest absolute value of standardized residuals is greater than 3, the corresponding observation should not give great cause for concern.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) $EBOLD
$BR
The diagonal values of the hat matrix (leverage values) can be obtained with the R function $BBOLD hat1 <- hatvalues(lm1) $EBOLD. The leading diagonal term on the hat matrix can be obtained with $BBOLD max(hat1)$EBOLD, which is 
$answers[2]. The influence of a specific leverage value should be considered in the context of the contribution of this value to the trace of the hat matrix, $BBOLD sum(hat1) $EBOLD.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (f) $EBOLD
$BR
The values of the covariates at the value with the largest entry on the diagonal of the hat matrix are $BBOLD Age[hat1==max(hat1)]$EBOLD, which is $answers[3] years and $BBOLD ResVO2[hat1==max(hat1)]$EBOLD, which is  $answers[4] mL/kg/min.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (g) $EBOLD
$BR
The gait speed fitted by the model at the observation identified in (f) is $BBOLD lm1${DOLLAR}fit[hat1==max(hat1)]$EBOLD, which is
$answers[5] m/s.
