BEGIN_TEXT
Your market research firm has been hired to conduct a survey. The
goal is to produce estimates of both average annual income and proportion with a post-secondary credential (PSC) in a target population.
A simple random sample from the population will be used. Informed
pre-study guesses are that (i) @x[0]% of this population has a PSC, and (ii)
the standard deviation of annual income in this population is around
$ @ymore[0]. Your client desires a 95% confidence interval with width no
more than 0.05 for the proportion with a post-secondary credential,
and a 95% confidence interval with width no more than $5,000 for the
average income in the population.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(a) $EBOLD Using the pre-study guesses, and being mindful of not proposing a more costly study than necessary, what sample size do you
recommend? Provide your answer as an integer. \{  ans_rule(7) \} 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(b) $EBOLD Regardless of what sample size is ultimately chosen, what is the
worst-case scenario for the 95% confidence interval for the proportion with a PSC, in terms of how much wider than anticipated it could turn out to be? Give your answer to two decimal places as a percentage of the width of the confidence interval based on the pre-study estimate. \{  ans_rule(7) \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The requirement for the confidence interval for
the sample proportion dictates that the sample size n must be
such that 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
2 \times 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{p (1-p)}{n} } < 0.05
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
where p is the population proportion with a PSC. We have an
initial estimate of this proportion, this being @x[0]/100. Hence,
our sample size must satisfy
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
n > \frac{  (2 \times 1.96)^2 (@x[0]/100)  (1-@x[0]/100) } {0.05^2}  
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
For the confidence interval for the mean income within the
population, the width would be
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
2 \times 1.96 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
where \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of incomes in the population. We have an estimate of this parameter, $ @ymore[0]. As
the width of the interval must be less than $5000, we know
that
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
2 \times 1.96 \times \frac{@ymore[0] }{\sqrt{n}} <5000
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
and so 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
 n >  (\frac{ 2 \times 1.96 \times @ymore[0] }{5000} )^2
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
In order to satisfy both the criteria, we must choose the larger
value of n. The figure must be rounded up to the nearest integer above to ensure the criteria are met.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The confidence interval will be widest when \(p(1-p) \) is
biggest, which occurs when p = 1/2. In that case, the interval
will be of width
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
 w_2 = 2 \times 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{4n}}
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
The width of the confidence interval based on the initial estimate is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
 w_1 = 2 \times 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{(@x[0]/100) (1-@x[0]/100) }{n}}
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
As a percentage of this original width, the worst-case interval is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
\frac{w_2-w_1}{w_1} \times 100% 
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
wider. Note that the answer is independent of n.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD The width of the confidence interval is proportional to the
standard deviation of incomes in the population. There is no
upper bound on this value, so there is no way to determine how
much wider the actual confidence interval will be compared to
the width of the interval using the pre-study estimate.
