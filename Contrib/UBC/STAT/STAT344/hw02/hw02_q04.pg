BEGIN_TEXT
In a medical study, a simple random sample of size 50 is obtained from a
general population. Each sampled person's age is recorded, and his/her
bone density (in appropriate units) is measured. The scatterplot shows the sample data.

You would like to estimate the average bone density in this population.
From census data you know that the mean age in the population is
48. The mean age in your sample happens to be higher than this. You
are considering three methods to estimate your target: "vanilla" (VN)
estimation, ratio (RT) estimation, and regression (RG) estimation.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The impact of ratio estimation can be visualized
by the upward-sloping line passing through the origin (0,0)
and also sample means \( \left( \overline{\text{age}}_S, \overline{\text{BD}}_S \right) \). Since the population
mean age is less than the sample mean age, we follow the line
to the left (and down), to obtain a ratio estimate less than the
vanilla estimate. In contrast, by visual inspection of the scatterplot, the regression line will clearly be downward-sloping. So in following the line to the left (and up), we obtain a regression estimate greater than the vanilla estimate. Hence RT< VN < RG is the correct ordering. 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The ratio estimate is completely inappropriate here. This
procedure aims to take advantage of a positive association between the two variables, whereas the scatterplot shows a negative association between age and bone density.
