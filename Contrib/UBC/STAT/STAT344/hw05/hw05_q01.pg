A web-based business carried out a survey of its past customers in the
following manner. Their database includes age group and email address for
everyone in this large population. At random they selected 300 past
customers, and emailed a questionnaire to them, with the incentive that a
gift card would be provided to anyone who responded. (The cost of providing
this incentive was the limiting factor in not being able to select more than
300 past customers.) One of the questionnaire items asked for annual income.
The file \(EmailSurvey.csv\) linked below gives age group (5 possible
categories) for all contacted customers, and the incomes of those who
responded. Income is recorded as `NA' for those not responding.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD
Amongst all sampled, the proportions falling in each
age group (\(n_{c}/n, c=1,\ldots, 5\)) are seen to be \(@wt_c[0], @wt_c[1], @wt_c[2], @wt_c[3], @wt_c[4]\). While amongst all participating, the average income (\(\bar{y}_{c}\)) in each age group is \(@y_c[0], @y_c[1], @y_c[2], @y_c[3], @y_c[4]\). Using the former to weight the latter gives an estimate of 
\( \sum_{c=1}^{5}(n_{c}/n)\bar{y}_{c}=@q1[0]\). 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD
Within each age group, the standard error for average
income is \( SE_{c}=\sqrt{s_{c}^{2}/k_{c}}, \) where \(k_{c}\) is
the number of participants in the age group. The five standard errors are
then \(@se_c[0], @se_c[1], @se_c[2], @se_c[3], @se_c[4]\). Combining these as per stratification, i.e., \(SE^{2}=\sum_{c=1}^{5}(n_{c}/n)^{2}SE_{c}^{2},\) gives 
\(SE=@q2[0]\). 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD
The correct answer is "Given age group, income and participation status are conditionally
independent", which corresponds to the missing at
random assumption, whereby the variable of interest and the participation
status are independent given the helper variables. (The analysis is also
valid under "Participation status is independent of age group and income", but this is a much stronger assumption. Whereas "Age group and participation status are independent" is not strong enough, as intuitively we could have higher income earners say being less likely to respond within each age group, and the analysis has no
mechanism to correct for this.)
