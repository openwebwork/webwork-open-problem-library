BEGIN_TEXT
A survey was carried out in which those sampled were asked to circle
either NO or YES on a paper questionnaire, according to the following
instructions: in private, spin a "wheel of fortune" which is equally likely to end up pointing to any integer from 1 to 100. If the result is a 40 or less, respond to Q1,
otherwise respond to Q2.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Q1 $EBOLD Flip a fair coin (again in complete privacy) --- do you get HEADS?
$BR
$BBOLD Q2 $EBOLD Have you ever shoplifted?
$BR
$BR
Of the 500 people randomly sampled from the target population, @x[0]
respond YES. Provide answers to the following to two decimal places.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD Give an estimate for the proportion of this population that has ever
shoplifted. \{  ans_rule(7) \} 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD Give a standard error for your estimate in (a). \{  ans_rule(7) \} 
$BR
$BR
Now, you and a colleague plan to replicate your study in a new population.
Your colleague proposes replacing the '40' in the instructions with '20.'
You see his point in terms of trying to get a more precise estimate.
However, you think that '20' is really  "pushing it." In particular, you posit that with '40,' everyone in the population would comply perfectly with the instructions. But with '20,'
you guess that 30% of shoplifters would lie if asked Q2. (Whereas no matter
what, you expect that non-shoplifters would always answer Q2 honestly.) 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD
If your suppositions happen to be correct, how much bias would the
estimation procedure have if '20' is used? To make this question more
specific, say the proportion you are trying to estimate --- the proportion of
the (new) population that have shoplifted --- happens to be @p[0].
Then at what value would the sampling distribution of the estimator be
centered? \{  ans_rule(7) \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD
Let \(q=0.6\) be the probability that a subject is
directed to the sensitive question. So then the probability of a YES
response is \(r=(1-q)(1/2)+qp\), where \(p\), the probability of
having shoplifted, is the target parameter. Hence \(
\hat{p}=\left( \hat{r}-(1-q)(1/2) \right) /q=\left(@x[0]/500-(0.4)(0.5) \right)/0.6=@q1[0]. \)
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD
With sample size n and the number responding YES denoted \(X\), the estimate of the standard deviation of the estimator \(\hat{p}\) is
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE[\hat{p}] &=&(1/q)SE[\hat{r}] \\
&=&(1/q)\sqrt{\hat{r}(1-\hat{r})/n} \\
&=&(1/0.6)\sqrt{(X/n)(1-X/n)/n} \\
&=& @q2[0],
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
the value calculated in the case \(n=500\) and \(X=@x[0]\). 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD
From the form of \(\hat{p}\) we know the sampling
distribution will be centered at \( \left(r-(1-0.8)(0.5)\right) / 0.8\), where \(r\)
is the probability of getting a YES response. Acknowledging that
only 70% of shoplifters would answer the sensitive question honestly gives 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\begin{eqnarray*}
r &=&(0.2)(0.5)+(0.8)\left( p(0.7)+(1-p)(0)\right)  \\
&=& @r[0]. 
\end{eqnarray*}
$ECENTER
$BR
Hence the sampling distribution of the estimator is centered at @q3[0].
