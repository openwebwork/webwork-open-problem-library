For example, if rolling a single die and recording the score, the events \( \{ \text{even score} \} \) and \( \{ \text{odd score} \} \) are complementary and cannot both occur on a given roll.", "The statement is false, since there is no way for the two events to exist in the same sample space and have an intersection that is the null event. This follows intuitively or via the definition of \( P(A \cup B) \).", "It is not possible to determine whether the two events are mutually exclusive, since it is possible for the two events to exist in the same sample space and either overlap or be disjoint.");
