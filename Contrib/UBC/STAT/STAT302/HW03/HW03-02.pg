BEGIN_TEXT

The country of Statland runs a national lottery for its people. In this lottery, an urn contains $N balls that are individually numbered 1, 2, ..., $N. Each week, 5 balls are drawn from the urn without replacement. Gamblers pay a small sum to predict these five numbers and the jackpot is won by anyone who has chosen all five correctly. A runners-up prize is won by anyone who correctly selected four of the five numbers. You have decided to play the Statland lottery and have chosen your five numbers at random from the $N available.  Give your answer to seven decimals in each part. (You may also express your answer exactly as a fraction; for example, if the exact answer were 1/9 then both "1/9" and "0.1111111" would be correct).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR

Part a) $BR $BR

With $N balls to choose from, the number of ways 5 can be selected is 

$BR

\( {$N \choose 5} = \frac{$N!}{5! \times ($N-5)!} \)

\( = \frac{$N($N-1)...($N-4)}{5!} \)

\( = $Nchoose5. \)

$BR

Hence, the required probability is

$BR

\( 1/$Nchoose5 = $ans_a. \)

$BR $BR

Part b) $BR $BR

The number of ways of getting four numbers correct must be divided by the number of possible choices. To find the numerator, four correct within 5 can be chosen in $BR

\( {5 \choose 4} = 5 \) ways.

$BR $Br

The number of ways the other, incorrect number can be chosen is $N-5. So the probability of winning a runners-up prize is $BR

\( \frac{5 \times ($N-5)}{$Nchoose5} \)

\( = $ans_b \).
