Angus goes to one of two coffee shops in his home town. He goes to Tarbucks $tar $PERCENT of the time and otherwise goes to Costly Coffee. Either way, he buys a latte $lat $PERCENT of the time, regardless of which place he chose.

You are told that Angus went into town for a coffee today. What is the probability (to 3 decimal places) that he had a latte at Tarbucks?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR

Part a) $BR $BR

\( \begin{align*} P(\text{Tarbucks and latte}) &= P(\text{latte | Tarbucks}) P(\text{Tarbucks}) \\ &= $ans_a. \end{align*} \)

$BR $BR

Part b) $BR $BR

Since $BR

\( P(\text{Tarbucks and latte}) = $ans_a = P(\text{latte}) P(\text{Tarbucks}) \), $BR

the two events are independent. Note that the choice of drink is independent of the location.

$BR $BR

Part c) $BR $BR

By independence $BR

\( P(\text{Costly Coffee | latte}) \) $BR \( = \frac{P(\text{Costly Coffee and latte})}{P(\text{latte})} \) $BR

\( = \frac{(1 - $p) $q}{$q} \) $BR

\( = $ans_c. \) $BR $BR

Part d) $BR $BR

\( P(\text{Tarbucks or latte or both}) \) $BR \( = P(\text{Tarbucks}) + P(\text{latte}) - P(\text{Tarbucks and latte}) \) $BR

\( = $p + $q - $ans_a \) $BR

\( = $ans_d. \)
