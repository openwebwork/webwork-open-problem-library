BEGIN_TEXT
A Statistics professor assigned 10 quizzes over the course of the semester. He wanted to see if there was a relationship between the total mark of all 10 quizzes and the final exam mark. There were $numStudents students who completed all the quizzes and wrote the final exam. The standard deviation of the total quiz marks was $sdQuiz, and that of the final exam was $sdFinal. The correlation between the total quiz mark and the final exam was $corr.

$PAR
Based on the least squares regression line fitted to the data of the $numStudents students, if a student scored $pointsAbove points above the mean of total quiz marks, then how many points above the mean on the final would you predict her final exam grade to be?

$PAR
The predicted final exam grade is \{ ans_rule(10)\} above the mean on the final. Round your answer to one decimal place, but do not round in intermediate steps.
