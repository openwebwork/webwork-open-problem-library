BEGIN_TEXT

An instructor is interested in checking whether attending labs improves students' performance on their finals. The instructor asks a TA to investigate this problem. The TA decides to conduct a one-sided two sample t-test. He randomly chooses 30 students in the course who never missed a lab, as well as 25 students from the same course who missed at least 1 lab. Let \( \mu_{1} \) denote the mean final exam score of all students in the course who never missed a lab. Let \( \mu_{2} \) denote the mean final exam score of all students in the course who missed at least 1 lab. The hypothesis test can be formulated as \( H_{0}:\mu_{1} = \mu_{2} \) vs \( H_{A}:\mu_{1} > \mu_{2} \). The P-value is 0.001.
