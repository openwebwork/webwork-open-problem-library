## Main Text: where all text goes (Required)

BEGIN_TEXT
 According to Statistics Canada's 2006 "Participation
and Activity Limitation Survey," out of a Canadian
population of 25.4 million aged 15 and over, 1.3 million people have some
hearing loss. The study also suggested that 19% of Canadians with some
degree of hearing loss use an assistive device such as a hearing aid. Let us
suppose that a new study takes a simple random sample of size @n[0] from all
Canadians over 15 with hearing loss and that within this sample, @m[0] people
use some assistive device.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The null hypothesis is the proportion of Canadians
over 15 with hearing loss who use an assistive device equals 0.19, as found
in the 2006 study.
$BR
$BR
(b) It is stated that it is of interest whether the rate
of use of assistive devices has increased since the 2006 study.
$BR
$BR
(c) The sample proportion is @phat[0].
$BR
$BR
(d) Under the hypothesis the population proportion \(\pi \) is
0.19, the sample proportion will be approximately Normal with mean 0.19 and
standard deviation
\[
\sqrt{\pi \left( 1-\pi \right) /@n[0]}=\sqrt{0.19\times 0.81/@n[0]}. 
\]
$BR
$BR

(e) This is a one--sided test, with alternative hypothesis that \(\pi
>0.19.\) Hence high values of the sample proportion lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis, and the P-value is found by finding the
probability to the right of @phat[0] via the model in (d). By
software or tables, this is @s5[0].
$BR
$BR

(f) There is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that the proportion
of Canadians over 15 with hearing loss who use an assistive device has
changed from the previous study in 2006.
