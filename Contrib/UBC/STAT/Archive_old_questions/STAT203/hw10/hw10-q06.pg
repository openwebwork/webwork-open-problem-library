Refer to the following scenario.
$PAR
An epidemiologist is worried about the prevalence of the flu in East Vancouver and the potential shortage of vaccines for the area. She will need to provide a recommendation for how to allocate the vaccines appropriately across the city. She takes a simple random sample of $n people living in East Vancouver and finds that $num have recently had the flu. 

$PAR
For each of the following statements, specify whether the statement is a correct interpretation of the 95$PERCENT confidence interval for the true proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu.

$PAR
$BBOLD A. $EBOLD
$phat$PERCENT ($num/$n) of East Vancouver residents have recently had the flu.
\{ $popup_a->menu() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD B. $EBOLD
There is a 95$PERCENT probability that the true proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu equals $num/$n.
\{ $popup_b->menu() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD C. $EBOLD
If another random sample of $n East Vancouver residents is drawn, there is a 95$PERCENT probability that the sample proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu equals $num/$n.
\{ $popup_c->menu() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD D. $EBOLD
If many random samples of $n East Vancouver residents are drawn, 95$PERCENT of the resulting confidence intervals will contain the value of the true proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu.  
\{ $popup_d->menu() \}


$PAR
$BBOLD E. $EBOLD
If many random samples of $n East Vancouver residents are drawn, 95$PERCENT of the resulting confidence intervals will contain the value $num/$n.
\{ $popup_e->menu() \}
