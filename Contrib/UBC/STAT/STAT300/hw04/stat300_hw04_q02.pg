So-called$BITALIC racial steering$EITALIC occurs when a real estate agent has a tendency to show prospective property buyers only homes in neighbourhoods already dominated by the race of the prospective buyer. Such action violates the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in the USA. Connor and Kadane (2001) write about an American court case where it was alleged that a real estate agent was applying racial steering to renters. Data were provided about how the race of a potential renter of an apartment in a complex appeared to influence the section in the complex the realtor showed the potential renter. The complex split into two sections, section A which was predominantly white and B which was predominantly black. Suppose the data over a two-year period were as below:

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD

Under either null hypothesis, the probability that \(Z\) is $t11 can be found directly, or in R via either 
$BR
$BR
dhyper($t11 , m = 95 , n = 117 , k = $t21 + $t11)
$BR
$BR
or using R Cmdr.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The data are presented in a court case for racial steering, a kind of discrimination in which the race of a potential renter influences the location of apartments they are shown by a realtor. It is inconceivable that such a case would go to court if in fact the realtor tended to show potential renters apartments in the section dominated by residents of a $BBOLD different$EBOLD race, so a one-sided alternative hypothesis seems sensible.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
This is Fisher's exact test, and can be performed in R via
$BR
$BR
fishertest <- fisher.test(table, alternative="greater")
$BR
$BR
The P-value is then fishertest\{$DOLLAR\}p.value.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Since the P-value is $pvalue, the answer is to "$ans_e" the null hypothesis.
