The ratio of the lengths of the second and the fourth fingers, denoted
2D:4D, is an indicator of the level of prenatal testosterone. It is known
that higher prenatal testosterone levels are associated with a lower
2D:4D value. Since testosterone levels are known to be related to behavioural 
traits, it has been conjectured that certain types of aggressive
and dominant behaviours may be associated with lower 2D:4D values.
van der Meij$BITALIC et al.$EITALIC (2012) conducted a study that investigated the
possible relationship between 2D:4D and so-called "sociable" and "aggressive"
dominance. For the study, 84 male students completed two
questionnaires, measuring sociable and aggressive dominance respectively, 
on which high scores related to increased aggression. After some
adjustments, a score between 1 and 6 was recorded for each subject
on each questionnaire. The participants' hands were scanned and measurements 
taken, on which a 2D:4D measure could be recorded per
subject by averaging the ratio for each hand. The authors concluded
that there is a significant correlation between 2D:4D and aggressive
dominance, but not with social dominance.

The work of van der Meij$BITALIC et al.$EITALIC (2012) is critiqued by Voracek (2013),
who casts doubt both on the statistical methodology and the reliability
of the questionnaire design. Intrigued, you conduct a small-scale study
to investigate the possible relationship between social dominance and
2D:4D. You recruit twelve of your male friends and request they complete 
the aggressive dominance survey. You also obtain their 2D:4D
values, averaging over both hands for each participant. Suppose the
data you obtain are as follows:

You are interested in whether any possible relationship between
aggressive dominance and 2D:4D differs between the genders. To
explore further, you collect data on ten of your female friends,
tabulated below:
$BR
$BR
\(
\begin{array}{c | c c c c c c c c c c}
\text{2D:4D} & $xf[0] & $xf[1] & $xf[2] & @xf[3] & @xf[4] & @xf[5] & @xf[6] & @xf[7] & @xf[8] & @xf[9] \\ \hline

Using R, fit a linear model to all the data you have collected, a
model which has gender as a factor and allows for both differing
slopes and intercepts for the two genders. You may wish to use
the$BITALIC as.factor$EITALIC command to create the factor here. Provide the
multiple \(R^2\) value for your model (to three decimal places).

The output R produces includes a summary of an F-test for
whether all terms in the model are zero other than the single

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
The estimate of the slope parameter is $ans_a.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
In testing the null hypothesis that the slope parameter is zero, the P-value is approximately $pvalue. When this value is less than 0.05, we reject
the null hypothesis.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
The multiple \(R^2\) value is $ans_c.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
The P-value is approximately $ans_d.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
If the P-value in (d) is greater than 0.05 we can conclude there is no significant linear relationship between aggressive dominance and 2D:4D for either gender. We might still come to that conclusion if the P-value is less than 0.05, since it may appear that the intercept terms differ but neither slope is significantly different from zero.
