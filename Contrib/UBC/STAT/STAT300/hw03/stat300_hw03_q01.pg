In 2012 researchers at Deakin University in Australia ran a twelve-week dietary intervention study involving twins. Within each twin pair volunteering, one sibling was placed at random on either a low or high fat diet for a period of twelve weeks. At the start of the study, each subject was weighed and the weight change (in g) for each subject was recorded at the end of the study, with a positive number indicating a gain, a negative number indicating a weight loss. Suppose the data collected were as in the table below: 

$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\[
\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccc}
\text{Pair:} & $pair_no \\ \hline
\text{Low fat diet:} & $low_data \\
\text{High fat diet:} & $high_data
\end{array}
\]
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR

The researchers decide to use a sign test to test the null hypothesis that the distribution of the differences in weight gain has median zero within twin pairs.

The test statistic is taken as the number of pairs in which the sibling on the high fat diet gained more weight. The null hypothesis is to be rejected if this count is greater than \($m\). To three decimal places, what is the significance level of this test?

Suppose that in fact the sibling on the high fat diet will gain more weight than their sibling in \($P1$PERCENT\) of cases over a twelve-week period. Taking this information to define the alternative hypothesis, compute the power of the hypothesis test to three decimal places.

Suppose that in fact the sibling on the high fat diet will gain more weight than their sibling in \($P2$PERCENT\) of cases over a twelve-week period. Now taking this information to define the alternative hypothesis, compute the power of the hypothesis test to three decimal places.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
One--sided, since it is plausible to assume that the low fat diet could only lead to a reduction in weight loss compared to the high fat diet.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
Denoting the test statistic as \(T\),$BITALIC under the null hypothesis$EITALIC, \(T \sim B\left( 12,1/2 \right)\). So the significance level of the test is
$BR
$BCENTER
\[
P\left( T > $m \right) = 1-P\left( T\leq $m \right)
\]
$ECENTER
$BR
which can either be found directly or in R via $BITALIC pbinom($m, size=12, prob=0.5, lower.tail = FALSE) $EITALIC.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
Under the alternative hypothesis \(H_{A}\) say, we have that  \(T\sim B\left( 12, $P1/100 \right) \). In this case the power of the test is
$BR
\[
P\left( \text{Reject } H_{0}|H_{A}\right) =P\left( T> $m \right) 
\]
$BR
which can either be found directly or in R via$BITALIC pbinom($m, size=12, prob=$P1/100, lower.tail = FALSE) $EITALIC .

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
Under the alternative hypothesis \(H_{A}\) say, we have that  \( T\sim B\left( 12, $P2/100\right) \). In this case the power of the test is
$BR
\[
P\left( \text{Reject } H_{0}|H_{A}\right) =P\left( T> $m \right) 
\]
$BR
which can either be found directly or in R via$BITALIC pbinom($m, size=12, prob=$P2/100, lower.tail = FALSE) $EITALIC .
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
As the median of the within--pair difference shifts upwards so that weight gain is more likely under the high fat diet, the test is more powerful. That is, as the actual median increases from zero (which corresponds to a 50$PERCENT chance of the sibling on the high fat diet showing the most weight gain) the test has a greater chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.
