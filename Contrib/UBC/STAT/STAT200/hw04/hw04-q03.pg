BEGIN_TEXT

Should you have a cup of coffee to make you more alert when studying for a big test? A researcher is interested in studying the effect of caffeine, and he comes up with the following plan for an experiment. The experiment will involve 100 volunteers each of which will take a memory test 20 minutes after drinking cola. Some volunteers will be randomly assigned to drink caffeine-free cola; some to drink regular cola (with caffeine), and the others a mixture of the two (getting a half dose of caffeine). For each volunteer, a test score (the number of items recalled correctly) will be recorded. The volunteers will not be told which type of cola they have been given, but the researcher who evaluates the results will prepare the cups of cola right on the spot (out of sight of the volunteers).
