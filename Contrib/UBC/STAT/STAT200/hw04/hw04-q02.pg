BEGIN_TEXT

A study investigated the effect of the length and the repetition of TV advertisements on students' desire to eat at a Sub-U-Like sandwich franchise. Sixty students watched a 50-minute television program that showed at least one commercial for Sub-U-Like during advertisement breaks. Some students saw a 30-second commerical, some saw a 60-second commercial, others a 90-second commerical. The same commerical was shown one, three, or five times during the program. After the viewing, each student was asked to rate their craving for a Sub-U-Like sandwich from the set {"Don't want to eat", "Neutral", "Want to eat"}.
