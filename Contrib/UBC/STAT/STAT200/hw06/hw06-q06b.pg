BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
An HP laser printer is advertised to print text documents at a speed of 18 ppm (pages per minute). The manufacturer tells you that the printing speed is actually a Normal random variable with a mean of $mu ppm and a standard deviation of $sigma ppm. Suppose that you draw a random sample of $sampnum printers.

$PAR
$BBOLD Part i) $EBOLD
Using the information about the distribution of the printing speeds given by the manufacturer, find the probability that the mean printing speed of the sample is greater than $a ppm. (Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).

$PAR
Probability (as a proportion) \{ans_rule(7)\}
