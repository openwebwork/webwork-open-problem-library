BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
The weights of cans of Ocean brand tuna are supposed to have a net
    weight of 6 ounces. The manufacturer tells you that the net weight
    is actually a Normal random variable with a mean of $mu ounces
    and a standard deviation of $sigma ounces. Suppose that you draw a
    random sample of $sampnum cans. 

$PAR
$BBOLD Part i) $EBOLD
Using the information about the distribution of the net weight given by the manufacturer, 
find the probability that the mean weight of the sample is less than $a ounces. 
(Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate
 steps. Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).

$PAR
Probability (as a proportion) \{ans_rule(7)\}
