In a study to compare the IQ between boys and girls in a particular elementary school, a random sample of seventh grade boys and girls was taken from Vancouver Hill Elementary School. The girls and boys were asked to take an IQ test and their scores were recorded. Some summary statistics of the IQs of the boys and girls is given below.
