BEGIN_TEXT
In a large class, there were $numStudents students who wrote both the midterm and the final exam. The standard deviation of the midterm grades was $sdMidterm, and that of the final exam was $sdFinal. The correlation between the grades on the midterm and the final was $corr. 

$PAR
Based on the least squares regression line fitted to the data of the $numStudents students, if a student scored $pointsBelow points below the mean on the midterm, then how many points below the mean on the final would you predict her final exam grade to be? 

$PAR
The predicted final exam grade is \{ ans_rule(10)\} below the mean on the final. Round your answer to one decimal place, but do not round in intermediate steps.
