BEGIN_TEXT

From previous studies, it has been generally believed that Northern
Hemisphere icebergs have a mean depth of 270 meters and a standard
deviation of 20 meters. An environmentalist has suggested that global
warming has caused icebergs to have greater depth. A team of
scientists visiting the Northern Hemisphere observed a random sample
of 41 icebergs. The depth of the base of the iceberg below the surface
was carefully measured for each and the sample mean and standard
deviation were calculated.
