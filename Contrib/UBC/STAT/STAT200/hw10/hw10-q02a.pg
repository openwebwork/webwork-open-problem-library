BEGIN_TEXT

The time taken for healthy Canadian adults to complete a logic problem
is believed to be Normally distributed with mean 40 seconds and
standard deviation 4 seconds. It is of interest to investigate whether
UBC students perform better on average than healthy adult Canadians,
so the logic problem is given to a sample of 80 UBC students, and
their times to solution are recorded.
