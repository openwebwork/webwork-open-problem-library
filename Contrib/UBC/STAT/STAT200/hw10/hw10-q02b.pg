A researcher for Agri-Giant Corporation wants to study how many pounds
of tomatoes are typically picked by a manual labourer in an 8-hour
day. The Corporation will consider using picking machines if the
labourers cannot pick at least 240 pounds, on average. The researcher
randomly sampled 100 farm labourers, found out how many pounds of
tomatoes each picked and calculated the sample mean and standard
deviation.
