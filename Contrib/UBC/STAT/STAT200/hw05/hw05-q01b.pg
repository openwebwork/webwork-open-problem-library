BEGIN_TEXT
Air Canada is preparing to launch a new airline specializing in servicing international flights, and is conducting a survey to collect data on the reasons for travel and the types of flights taken by its current customers. The survey was randomly given to individuals who had booked a flight for travel within the next month.

In order to attract potential customers to its new airline, Air Canada is giving discounts 
to individuals that are flying to international destinations during its first month 
of service. The 800 individuals who were travelling outside of Canada were invited to 
participate in the following experiment. Half of the individuals travelling for business related reasons 
are randomized to receive the discounted air fare and half do not receive a discount. 
The individuals travelling for leisure purposes are randomized in a similar fashion. After 
six months, the proportion of business travellers who continue to fly with Air Canada's new airline is 
compared between the discounted airfare group and the regular airfare group. The same comparison is also 
done among the leisure travellers.
