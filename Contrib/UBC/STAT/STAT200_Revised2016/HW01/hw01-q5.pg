## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The two variables are not independent because, for example,
the percentage of males among students who passed is not the same as the
percentage of males among students who failed. If the two variables were
independent we would expect to see the same, or very similar, distributions
of pass/fails for each gender.
