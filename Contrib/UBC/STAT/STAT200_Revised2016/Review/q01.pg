A government official is in charge of allocating social programs throughout the city of Vancouver.  
He will decide where these social outreach programs should be located based on the percentage 
of residents living below the poverty line in each region of the city.  He takes a simple random 
sample of $n people living in Gastown and finds that $num have an annual income that is below 
the poverty line. 
$PAR
The government official will choose Gastown as a location for one of the social outreach programs if his sample data provide sufficient evidence to support that the true proportion of people living below poverty line is greater than $pnull.  A test of hypothesis is conducted.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(i) The inference here is about the population proportion, 
\(p\) say, that lives below the poverty line. A null hypothesis will
assert a single value to a parameter, and so in this case the null
hypothesis is \( H_{0}:p= $pnull. \)
$BR
$BR
(ii) In the alternative, we are interested in the case where \(p>$pnull.\) Hence this set of values defines the alternative hypothesis. 
$BR
$BR
(iii) Let \(\hat{p}\) denote the sample proportion below the
poverty line. Then if \(p=$pnull,\) we have that
approximately 
\[
\hat{p}\sim N\left( $pnull, \sqrt{\frac{$pnull \left( 
1-$pnull\right) }{$n}}\right) = $mc3_answer. 
\]
$BR
$BR
(iv) The sample proportion observed is \( \hat{p}= $num/ $n.\) 
This value, if consistent with the distribution in (iii), when
standardised gives a z score of 
\[
\frac{$num/$n-$pnull}{\sqrt{\frac{$pnull\left(1-$pnull\right)}{$n}}}= $tem.
\]
Comparing the above figure with the standard Normal distribution, we
know that 95% of the distribution lies in the interval \(\left(
-1.96,1.96\right).\) We can define unusually large or small values as
being outside that range.
