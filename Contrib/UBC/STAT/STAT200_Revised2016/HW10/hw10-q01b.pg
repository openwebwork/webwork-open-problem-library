## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) For the sample of size 30 the sample mean is $mean and we are told the population standard deviation is $stdev (both in $). Then a 99% confidence
interval for the population mean earnings of all Rolling Stones concerts
over the past twenty years is 
\[
$mean \pm 2.575829\times $stdev / \sqrt{30}=\left( $lb_dis, $ub_dis\right),
\]
where 2.575829 is the 99.5% point of the standard Normal distribution.
$BR
$BR
(b) The correct interpretation considers repeating the study many
times, and computing the corresponding 99% confidence interval for each set
of data produced. We would expect 99% of such intervals to contain the true
mean earnings of all the concerts.
