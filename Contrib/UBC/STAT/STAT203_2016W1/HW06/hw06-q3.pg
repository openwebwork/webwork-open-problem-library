## Main Text: where all text goes (Required)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_TEXT
In real life, most of the speech we are exposed to is accompanied by
information other than just the acoustic signal. We usually know things
about the physical, social, and language context in which a sentence is
being uttered, such as who is uttering it. At the very least, we can usually
see the person who is talking (unless, of course, we are talking on the
phone or in two different rooms). Some work of Dr. Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson
has investigated how much information people can extract from the visual
signal under different conditions. In Munhall \(et~ al\). (2004), he and
his colleagues manipulated videos of someone talking to be clearer or less
clear by setting different filter conditions -- you can see example pictures
from each filter condition in Figure 1 in Munhall \(et ~al\). (2004,
p.577). The details of each filter are not relevant for the current purpose.
$BR
In each video, the talker in the video said a series of sentences in
English. The audio of these sentences was partially masked by noise to make
the task harder and make reliance on visual information more important.
Munhall \(et~ al\). had native English speakers watch each type of video
and listen to the sentences; the English speakers then had to verbally
repeat as much of each sentence as they could, and the researchers
calculated the percentage of key words correctly identified in the
sentences. In one of the tasks they report, they also manipulated the
distance from the video that the English speakers were seated: 114 cm, 228
cm, or 342 cm. The percentage of words correctly identified are given in the
following table (note that these are approximations of the percent correct
from Figure 3 of the original paper, which provides only a graphical summary
and not a numerical one).

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
 (a) This is an experiment, because the variables are being
actively manipulated to observe their effects.
$BR
$BR

(b) The English speakers who watched the videos are the experimental
units (but more usually referred to as subjects or participants when human
as here).
$BR
$BR

(c) The percentage of words correctly identified is the response
variable that is being measured.
$BR
$BR

(d) There are two factors, filter condition and viewing distance.
Filter condition has five levels in the results shown here (though in fact
there is a sixth level, the full video though this was not included as a
possible level in the experiment). Viewing distance has three levels.
$BR
$BR

(e) There are 15 treatments, i.e., 15 possible combinations of the
levels of the two factors. (Note: in this particular case, every subject
experienced all fifteen treatments. This was possible because the sentences
used in each treatment were different -- there were in fact six sentences
per treatment.)
$BR
$BR

(f) Filter condition seems to have had more of an impact than viewing
distance. We can conclude this from the fact that the variation within a
filter condition but across viewing distances (the columns) is much smaller
than the variation across filter conditions and within viewing distances
(the rows). For example, within the single viewing distance of 342 cm, the
percent correct varies from 33% (filter condition B) to 57% (filter
condition D), a range of 24%. Meanwhile, the maximum range within a single
filter condition is 7.5%, which we see in filter condition (F), comparing
viewing distances of 342 cm (40% correct) either 114 or 228 cm (47.5%
correct).
