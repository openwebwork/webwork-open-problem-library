Brosnahan $BITALIC et al. $EITALIC (2004) investigated the relationship between
mental health and physical exercise in youths. Suppose as part of the study
a sample of \($param_n\) non-hispanic white boys aged fifteen was taken, and
the body mass index was recorded on each (in kg/m\(^{2}\)). In the population
of non-hispanic fifteen-year-old white boys, assume that body mass index
follows a distribution with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \($param_sd\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD 
Denote the sample mean \(\bar{Y}\). Then the
standard deviation of \(\bar{Y}\) is \($param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}=$ans_a\).
$BR
$BR


$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD 
To find the upper bound required, note that Chebyshev's inequality
states here that
\begin{align*}
P\left( \left| \bar{Y}-\mu \right| >\varepsilon \right) \leq \frac{$param_sd^{2}/$param_n}{1.96^{2}\times $param_sd^{2}/$param_n}=0.260,
\end{align*}
since \(\varepsilon =1.96 \times $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\).
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD 
We are required to estimate
\begin{align*}
P\left( \left| \bar{Y}-\mu \right| >1.96\times $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\right) =
P\left( \bar{Y}<\mu -1.96\times $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\right) +P\left( \bar{Y}>\mu +1.96\times $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\right) .
\end{align*}
Using the Central Limit Theorem, we have that approximately \(\bar{Y}
\sim N\left( \mu ,$param_sd^{2}/$param_n \right)\). Hence
\begin{align*}
P\left( \left| \bar{Y}-\mu \right| >1.96\times $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\right) &\approx 2P\left( \bar{Y}<\mu -1.96\times $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\right)  \\
&=2P\left( \frac{\bar{Y}-\mu }{ $param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}}
<-1.96\right)  \\
&=2P\left( Z<-1.96\right) 
\end{align*}
where \(Z\sim N\left( 0,1\right)\). The above probability is
0.05. 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD 
If the observations are each from the Normal distribution, the sample
mean follows the \(N\left( \mu ,$param_sd^{2}/$param_n\right) \)
exactly. Hence the probability in (c) is no longer an approximation
but could be taken as being exact.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD 
The distribution of the sample mean is Normal with mean \(\mu\)
and standard deviation \($param_sd/\sqrt{$param_n}\) 
 since each observation is from a Normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) 
and standard deviation \($param_sd\).
