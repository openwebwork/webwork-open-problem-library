BEGIN_TEXT
Items in your inventory are produced at three different plants: 
50$PERCENT from plant A1, 
30$PERCENT from plant A2 and 
20$PERCENT from plant A3. 
You are aware that your plants produce at different levels of quality: 
A1 produces 5 percent defectives, 
A2 produces 7 percent defectives and 
A3 yields 8 percent defectives. 
You randomly select an item from your inventory and it turns out to be 
defective. Which plant is the item most likely to have come from?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:$PAR
The correct answer is \{ $radio->correct_ans() \}
$PAR

Draw a decision tree. If a sample is chosen at random, it could 
have come from A1 (probability 50$PERCENT), A2 (30$PERCENT), or A3 (20$PERCENT).
Now consider if the sample is defective. If it came from A1, the probability that 
it is defective is 5$PERCENT. So the probability that the sample came from A1
AND is defective is 50$PERCENT times 5$PERCENT, or 2.5$PERCENT. If you calculate
the probability for the sample being defective in the other two cases, you will 
see that the first case has the highest probability.
