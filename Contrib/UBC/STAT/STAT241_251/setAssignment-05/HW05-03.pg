The horsepower (Y, in bhp) of a motor car engine was measured at a chosen set of values of running speed (X, in rpm). The data are given below (the first row is the running speed in rpm and the second row is the horsepower in bhp):

\{ 
BeginTable(border=>1, tex_border=>"1pt", spacing=>0, padding=>4).
AlignedRow( [@X], align=>LEFT, separation=>0).
AlignedRow( [@Y], align=>LEFT, separation=>0).
EndTable()
\}

The mean and sum of squares of the rpm are \( $meanx \) rpm and \( $sumx2 \) rpm \(^2\) respectively; the mean of the horsepower values is \( $meany \) bhp and the sum of the products of the two variables is \( $sumxy \) rpm bhp. A scatterplot displaying the data is shown below:

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
The slope term is
$BR
\( \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{n \sum_i x_i y_i - \sum_i x_i \sum_i y_i}{n \sum_i x_i^2 - (\sum_i x_i)^2} = $slope \)
$BR
and the intercept is
$BR
\( \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} = $inter. \)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
The fitted value at rpm 2400 is given by \( \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 (2400) = $bans. \)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
The predicted increase will be \( 100 \hat{\beta}_1 = $cans. \)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
We will use \( SE(\hat{\beta}_1) \), the estimated standard deviation of \( \hat{\beta}_1 \), given here as \( $estSlVar \). The relevent percentile on the t distribution is \( t_{$n-2} (0.975) = $tcod \) and the confidence interval is therefore
$BR
\( \hat{\beta}_1 \pm ($tcod)($estSlVar) = ($low, $high). \)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
The answer is "narrower" since the variance of \( \hat{\beta}_1 \) is inversely proportional to the variance of the rpm values chosen.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part f) $EBOLD
The test statistic is
$BR
\( \frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)} = $fans. \)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part g) $EBOLD
If the test statistic falls above \( t_{$n-2}(0.995) = $tcod995 \) (or, much less likely, below \( t_{$n-2}(0.005) = $tcod005 \) ), the answer is
$BR
"Since the observed test statistic falls in either the upper or lower 1/2 percentiles of the t distribution with \( $dof \) degrees of freedom, we can reject the null hypothesis that the horsepower does not depend linearly on rpm;"
$BR
otherwise, far less likely, the response is 
$BR
"Since the observed test statistic does not fall in either the upper or lower 1/2 percentiles of the t distribution with \( $dof \) degrees of freedom, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the horsepower does not depend linearly on rpm."
