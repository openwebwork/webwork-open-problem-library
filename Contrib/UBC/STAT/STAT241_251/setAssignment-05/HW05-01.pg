The study ran over a period of fourteen weekdays, and on a given day the coffee brand was shelved in one of three different heights: knee, waist, or eye level.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Throughout, we will denote the ith data point of $thedata1[$ver] (with mean \( \bar{y_1} \) ), $thedata2[$ver] (with mean \( \bar{y_2} \)), and $thedata3[$ver] (with mean \( \bar{y_3} \) ) by \( {y_1}_i \), \( {y_2}_i \), and \( {y_3}_i \) respectively.

$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The true statements are (ii), (iii), and (v).

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Denoting \( y_i \) to be the ith data point for $thedata1[$ver], the standard deviation is \( \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4-1} \sum_{i=1}^4 ({y_1}_i-\bar{y_1} )^2 } = $bans \).

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The common variance is the error mean square (MSE):

\( MSE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^4 ({y_1}_i - \bar{y_1})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^5 ({y_2}_i - \bar{y_2})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^5 ({y_3}_i - \bar{y_3})^2}{(4-1) + (5-1) + (5-1)} = $dv. \)


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The MSE was found in (c). The SS factor is:

\( 4(\bar{y_1} - \bar{y})^2 + 5 (\bar{y_2} - \bar{y})^2 + 5 (\bar{y_3} - \bar{y})^2 = $di\).

The total SS is the sum of the error SS and the factor SS, and has 13 degrees of freedom. Each mean square SS is the SS divided by its degrees of freedom and the test statistic is the ratio MSA/MSE.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The 95th percentile of the \( F_{2,11} \) distribution is 3.982. If the observed F statistic is greater than this number, we can reject the null hypothesis; if the observed F statistics is smaller than this number, we do not reject the null hypothesis. In this case, the F statistic is \( $dvi \), so the correct answer is:
$BR
$Ec
