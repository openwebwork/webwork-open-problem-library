BEGIN_TEXT
You are working on a programming project with your partner for a computer science course. The project is due in 48 hours. Together, you are to produce a computer program and each of you are assigned to write a portion of computer code. Both of you work simultaneously, but independently. The completion time of your task follows a uniform distribution between 30 and 50 hours. Your partner is stronger in programming and his task is more complex, and the completion time for his task follows a uniform distribution between $a and $b hours.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Let \( X \) be the time I take to complete my task. Let \( Y \) be the time it takes my partner to complete her task.  

$PAR
Part a) The question asks for the expectation \( E(Y) \) which for a uniform random variables \( Y \sim \mbox{uniform}($a, $b)\) is given by \( \frac{$a + $b}{2} \). Hence the answer is \{ $mc1->correct_ans()  \}; $BR

$PAR
Part b) Here we are asked for the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance \( \mbox{Var}(Y)\).  Since \( Y \) is uniform, the variance is given by \( \frac{($b - $a)^2}{12}\).
Hence the standard deviation is $ans2  which is choice \{ $mc2->correct_ans()  \}; $BR

$PAR
Part c) Let \( W \) be our project's completion time.  Here we assume that \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent and my partner and I start at the same time. Then \( W = \max(X, Y). \)  We're asked to find
\( F_W(w) \) for \( $a \le w \le $b \).  \( P (W \le w ) = P(X \le w, Y \le w) =  P(X \le w) \cdot P(Y \le w) \) since \( X, Y \) are independent. But \(  P(X \le w)  = F_X(w) \) and  \(  P(Y \le w)  = F_Y(w) \) so the quantity we wish to compute is \( 1- F_X(w) \cdot F_Y(w) = 1- \frac{w - 30}{20} \cdot \frac{w - $a}{$b - $a} \), given by choice  \{ $mc3->correct_ans()  \}; $BR

$PAR
Part d) First we need to write down \( F_W(w). \)  This is given by
\[
F_W(w) = 
    \begin{cases} 
            0                                                           & w < $a  \\ 
            \frac{w-30}{20} \cdot \frac{w-$a}{$b-$a}   & $a \le w < 50  \\ 
            \frac{w-$a}{$b-$a}                                     & 50 \le w < $b  \\ 
            1                                                           & w \ge $b. 
    \end{cases} 
\]

Then 
\begin{align*}
   P(W < 48 + 4 \mid  W > 48)  &= \frac{P(W < 52 \cap W > 48)}{P(W > 48)} \\
                                                &= \frac{ P( 48 < W < 52) }{ P( W > 48 ) } \\
                                                &= \frac{ F_W(52) - F_W(48) }{ 1 - F_W(48) } \\ 
                                                &= \frac{ (\frac{52-$a}{$b-$a}) - ( \frac{48-30}{20} \cdot \frac{ 48 - $a }{ $b-$a } ) } 
                                                            { 1 - ( \frac{ 48 - 30 }{ 20 } \cdot \frac{ 48 - $a }{ $b-$a } ) } \\
                                                &\approx $ans4
\end{align*}
 
(choice \{ $mc4->correct_ans()  \}); $BR
