BEGIN_TEXT
An exam consists of $n multiple-choice questions. Each question has a choice of five answers, only one of which is correct. For each correct answer, a candidate gets 1 mark, and no penalty is applied for getting an incorrect answer. A particular candidate answers each question purely by guess-work. 

$PAR
\{ $mc1->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc1->print_a() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
We have \(n = $n\) and \(p = $p\), and
\( X \sim \mbox{Bin}($n, $p )\). $BR

By a rule of thumb, since \(n p > 5\) and \( n p (1-p) > 5\), we can approximate
\( X \sim \mbox{N}(np, npq )\); $BR that is,
\( X \sim \mbox{N}($np, $npq )\).

$PAR
We want to compute \(P (X \ge 10) \).  We must apply a continuity correction, which makes the
probability we want to compute \(P (X \ge 9.5) \).  Transforming this to a standard normal
distribution, we find that the quantity we want to compute is 

\begin{align}
  P (X \ge 9.5)  &= P \left (Z \ge \frac{ 9.5 - np } {\sqrt { npq }} \right)  \\
                       &= P (Z \ge (9.5 - $np) / \{sprintf("%2.4f", sqrt($npq))\} ) \\
                       &= $ans1
\end{align}
