BEGIN_TEXT

You purchase a chainsaw, and can buy one of two types of batteries to
power it, namely Duxcell and Infinitycell. Batteries of each type have
lifetimes before recharge that can be assumed independent and Normally
distributed. The mean and standard deviation of the lifetimes of the
Duxcell batteries are $mean1 and \{ $sigma1 \} minutes respectively, the
mean and standard deviation for the Infinitycell batteries are $mean2
and $sigma2 minutes respectively.

$PAR
$PAR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD

What is the probability that a Duxcell battery will last longer than
an Infinitycell battery?  Give your answer to two decimal places. 
\{ ans_rule(6) \}

$PAR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD

What is the probability that an Infinitycell battery will last more
than twice as long as a Duxcell battery? Give your answer to two
decimal places. \{ ans_rule(6) \}

$PAR
$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD

You are going to cut down a large tree and do not want to break off
from the job to recharge your chainsaw battery. You buy two Duxcell
batteries, and plan to use one until it runs out of power, after which
you immediately replace it with the second battery. How long (in
minutes) can the job last so that with probability 0.75 you can
complete the job using the two Duxcell batteries in sequence?

$PAR
Provide your answer to 1 decimal place. \{ ans_rule(6) \}

The correct answers  are: $BR

Part a) The probability is \{ sprintf("%2.2f", $prob1)  \} $BR
Part b) The probability is \{ sprintf("%2.2f", $prob2) \} $BR
Part c) \{  sprintf("%2.1f", $time) \} minutes $BR
