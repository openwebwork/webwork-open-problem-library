BEGIN_TEXT

Traffic police monitor the speed of vehicles as they travel over a new bridge. The average speed for a sample of \( $n \) vehicles was \( $xbar \) km/h, with the sample standard deviation being \( $st \) km/h. We will assume that the speeds are Normally distributed, and the police are interested in the mean speed.


$PAR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
Since the variance of the underlying Normal distribution is not known, inference here would involve the t distribution. How many degrees of freedom would the relevant t distribution have? \{ ans_rule(6) \}


$PAR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
Create a 95 $PERCENT confidence interval for the mean speed of vehicles crossing the bridge. Give the upper and lower bounds to your interval, each to 2 decimal places.   ( \{ $multians->ans_rule(6) \},\{ $multians->ans_rule(6)\})

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The answer is \( $n - 1 \) degrees of freedom.

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
	The confidence interval is of the form \( \bar{x} \pm t_{n-1}(0.975) \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \) where the 97.5 $PERCENT point of \( t_{n-1} \) is denoted \( t_{n-1}(0.975). \)
$BR
Here, the interval is \( $xbar \pm $tcoshow \times \frac{$xsd}{\sqrt{$n}} = ($ashow, $bshow). \)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
We check to see if \( 80 \) is contained within the confidence interval above. If it is, then we do not reject the hypothesis; if it is not, then we reject the hypothesis. In this case, the correct answer is:
$BR $BR $mc3_answer

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Typically decreasing the significance level will increase the Type II error probability.
