BEGIN_PGML

Two cities have the same longitude. The latitude of city A is [`[$degreeA]^{\circ}`] north and the latitude of city B is [`[$degreeB]^{\circ}`] north. Assume the radius of the earth is [`3960`] miles. Find the distance between the two cities.

[@KeyboardInstructions(

The distance between those two cities is [____________]{$arcU}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Those difference between those two cities's latitude is [`[$degreeB]^{\circ}-[$degreeA]^{\circ}=[$degreeDif]^{\circ}`].

To calculate the length of the arc between those two cities along the longtitude, we need to use the arc length formula:

The arc length, [`s`], corresponding to an angle of [`\theta`] radians in a circle of radius [`r`] is [`s = r \cdot \theta `]. Note that you need to change the angle to radian if it's given in degrees.

To calculate the arc length, we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  s &= r \cdot \theta \\
    &= 3960 \text{ mi} \cdot [$degreeDif]^{\circ}\cdot \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}} \\
    &\approx [$arcU]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The distance between those two cities is [`[$arcU]`].
