BEGIN_PGML

A piston moves forward and backward when it runs. At the beginning [`(t=0)`], the piston was at its nutural position, [`[$d]`] inches from its base. The piston moved away from its base. [`[$p4]`] seconds since [`t=0`], the piston was at its farthest distance from its base, [`[$high]`] cm. Then, the piston moved back toward its base. [`[$p34]`] seconds since [`t=0`], the piston was at its closest distance from its base, [`[$low]`] cm. Then, it switched direction and moved toward its nutural position again.

The function [`p(t)`] models the piston's distance from its base since it started to move at [`t=0`]. *Use graphing technology* to answer the following questions.

Part a: The function, as a transformation of [`y=\sin(x)`], is [`p(t)=`][________________________]{$func}.

Part b: After [`[$t[0]]`] seconds, the piston was [_______________]{$h[0]} cm away from its base.

Part c: During the time interval [`t\in([$iL],[$iR])`], the piston was [`[$h[1]]`] cm from its base at the following moments: [______________________]{$ans} seconds.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

###Part a

We could use [`y=\sin(x), y=\cos(x)`] and [`y=-\cos(x)`] to model periodic data. In this situation, when [`t=0`], the piston is at its neutral position, or the middle of maximum and minimum values. This matches the graph of [`y=\sin(x)`], which is in the middle of maximum and minimum values when [`x=0`], so we should choose to use the following function to model the piston's position:

    [``p(t)=a\sin\left(bt\right)+d``]
    
Note that there is no horizontal translation, because the function is in the middle of its maximum and minimum values when [`t=0`], just like [`y=\sin(x)`].

The function's midline is the average values of the function's maximum and minimum values:

    [``\begin{aligned}
  d &= \frac{\text{maximum value}+\text{minimum value}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{[$high]+[$low]}{2} \\
    &= [$d]\text{ cm}
    \end{aligned}``]

The function's amplitude can be calculated by:

    [``\begin{aligned}
  a &= \frac{\text{maximum value}-\text{minimum value}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{[$high]-[$low]}{2} \\
    &= [$a]\text{ cm}
    \end{aligned}``]

The piston was at its maximum value at [`([$p4],[$high])`], and at its minimum value at [`([$p34],[$low])`]. The time in between is half of the period, so:

    [``\text{period}=2([$p34]-[$p4])=[$p]``]

For the function [`p(t)=a\sin\left(bt\right)+d`], by the period formula [`\text{new period}=\frac{\text{old period}}{b}`], we have:

    [`` b = \frac{\text{old period}}{\text{new period}} = \frac{2\pi}{[$p]} ``]

The function's formula is

    [``p(t) = [$func] ``]

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` h(t) = [$func] `].

###Part b

To find the piston's position after [`[$t[0]]`] seconds, we need to substitute the function's [`t`] value with [`[$t[0]]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` p([$t[0]]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$h0Show]`].

After [`[$t[0]]`] seconds, the piston was [`[$h0Show]`] cm away from the base.

###Part c

To find when the piston was [`[$h[1]]`] cm away from its base, we need to create a second function [`y=[$h[1]]`], and then let desmos find the intersection between [`p(t)`] and [`y=[$h[1]]`].

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$h[1]]`].

Step 4: Since we only want to find intersections in [`t\in([$iL],[$iR])`], click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis to that interval. Now you can see the intersection of [`p(t)`] and [`y=[$h[1]]`].

Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`p(t)`] and [`y=[$h[1]]`]. Desmos shows [`([$tShow[1]],[$h[1]])`] and [`([$tShow[2]],[$h[1]])`].

During the time interval [`t\in([$iL],[$iR])`], the piston was [`[$h[1]]`] cm from its base at the following moments: [`[$tShow[1]], [$tShow[2]]`] seconds.

Below is the function's graph with solutions of this problem:
