To determine how far a boat is from shore, two radar stations [`[$a]`] miles apart find the angles out to the boat, as shown in the figure. The angle of elevation from Station A to the boat is [`[$B]^{\circ}`], and angle of elevation from Station B to the boat is [`[$C2]^{\circ}`].

Determine the distance of the boat from Station A and Station B.

The distance from the boat to Station A is [____________]{$c} miles.
    
The distance from the boat to Station B is [____________]{$b} miles.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the boat is at Point C. Assume the distance from the boat to Station A is [`x`] miles, and to Station B is [`y`] miles.

>>[@ image(insertGraph( $picture[1]  ), width=>240, extra_html_tags => "alt = '$text[1]' title = '$text[1]' ") @]*<<

Since the angle of elevation from Station B to the boat is [`[$C2]^{\circ}`], the measure of [`\angle CBA `] inside the triangle is [`m\angle CBA =  180^{\circ} - [$C2]^{\circ} = [$C]^{\circ}`].

Next, calculate [`m\angle C`]:

    [``\begin{aligned}[t]
  m\angle C &= 180^{\circ} - m\angle A - m\angle B \\
            &= 180^{\circ} - [$B]^{\circ} - [$C]^{\circ} \\
            & =[$A]^{\circ}
     \end{aligned}``]

Next, use Law of Sines to calculate the length of [`x`]:

    [``\begin{aligned}[t]
  \frac{\sin(C)}{c} &= \frac{\sin(B)}{x} \\
  x\sin(C) &= c\sin(B) \\
  x &= \frac{c\sin(B)}{\sin(C)} \\
  x &= \frac{[$a]\sin([$C]^{\circ})}{\sin([$A]^{\circ})} \\
  x &= [$c]
     \end{aligned}``]

The distance from the boat to Station A is [`[$c]`] miles.

And, use Law of Sines to calculate the length of [`y`]:

    [``\begin{aligned}[t]
  \frac{\sin(C)}{c} &= \frac{\sin(A)}{y} \\
  y\sin(C) &= c\sin(A) \\
  y &= \frac{c\sin(A)}{\sin(C)} \\
  y &= \frac{[$a]\sin([$B]^{\circ})}{\sin([$A]^{\circ})} \\
  y &= [$b]
     \end{aligned}``]

The distance from the boat to Station B is [`[$b]`] miles.
