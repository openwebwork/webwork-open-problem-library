## Basic Operations  ##

The four basic arithmetic operations are: 
    [`+, -, \times, \div`]

Each of these has a corresponding character on the keyboard. The first two are found in the upper right area of most keyboards. For [`\times`] (which is also often denoted with [`\cdot`] on paper), we use the asterisk character:
:       \*
This is the shift-8 key on most keyboards.

Try literally entering [`[$a]\cdot[$b]+[$c]`] by typing it exactly as:
:       [$a]\*[$b]+[$c]

    [_________]{Compute($a*$b+$c)->cmp(formatStudentAnswer=>'parsed')}

Of course you could also simplify this to [`[$d]`].

Division is typed using the slash character:
:       /
which is in the lower right of most keyboards. Try entering the following:


    [::[$w]=::] [____]{$w}    

    [::[$e]=::] [_________]{$e}

Raising to a power is universally denoted with the caret symbol:
:       [$CARET]
This is usually shift-6 on a keyboard. Try entering the following: 

    [::[$f]=::] [____]{$f}    

    [::[$g]=::] [____]{$g}

This is a good time to point out that _capitalization matters_. In math, [`k\neq K`]. See what happens if you use the wrong capitalization in the above answers. If you are not getting one of these answers correct, is it because of capitalization?

Another common basic operation is the square root, which is denoted with [`\sqrt{\phantom{x}}`] on paper. There is no square root character on most keyboards, so we do something else with this operation. We use:
:       sqrt
and parentheses, as in:
:       sqrt(x)
for [`\sqrt{x}`]. 

Try entering the following:

    [::[$h]=::] [_________]{$h}

[%We also sometimes use radicals of higher order. For example the cube root of [`x`] is denoted [`\sqrt[3]{x}`], and this would be typed as:
:       root(3,x)
This will only be an option in problems that are potentially expecting you to use it. Try entering the following:%]

[%    [``[$i]=``] [_________]{$i}%]

When you are ready, move on to the next question.
