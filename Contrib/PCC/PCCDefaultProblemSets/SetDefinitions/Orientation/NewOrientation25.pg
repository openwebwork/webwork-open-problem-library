Context("Fraction");

$den = random(2,5,1);
$ans = random(1,5,1);
$num = $den*$ans;
$num1 = random(1,$num,1);
$num2 = $num - $num1;

## Using Parentheses  ##

Look at this fraction:

    [`` \frac{1+1}{2} ``]

The value of this function should be 1. However, if you enter [` 1+1/2 `], the value will be [` 1.5 `]. This is because, by order of operations, the computer does division before doing addition:

    [`` 1+1/2 = 1+0.5 = 1.5 ``]

This is not what we want the computer to do. So how can we tell the computer to do addition in the numerator first? We must use parentheses:

    [`` (1+1)/2 ``]

By order of operations, the computer will handle parentheses before doing division. This time, the value is [` (1+1)/2=2/2=1 `].

Now, enter the fraction literally, without doing any calculation:

    [`` \frac{[$num1]+[$num2]}{[$den]} ``] = [________________]{$ans}

If you forget to use parentheses, you will see [` [$num1] + \frac{[$num2]}{[$den]} `] in the Answer Preview field. This is incorrect.

When you are ready, move on to the next question.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

You should enter: _[` ([$num1]+[$num2])/[$den] `]_ 

Did you forget the parentheses?
