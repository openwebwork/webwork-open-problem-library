## Printing off a Homework Set ##

For many reasons, you might not be able to work through an entire problem set while sitting online in front of a computer screen. From the *Homework Sets* page, you may push the button to the left of a homework set to download a PDF version of the homework set. 

This file is something that you can read onscreen while you are not online. You can even print it off and take it to a tutoring center or your favorite coffee shop to work on. (Please do not waste paper by actually printing an assignment unless you feel that it is necessary.)

To make sure that you understand how this works, download the PDF version of this Orientation assignment. At the end of this problem in the PDF, you will find the answer to this answer blank: [___________]{Compute("$a")->cmp(tolType=>'absolute',tolerance=>0.1)}
