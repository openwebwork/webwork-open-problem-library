This set of $WW problems is designed to orient you to the 
$WW system and to help you learn how to communicate with the 
software. You will learn how to understand what
you see on the screen and how to enter your answers when you do 
the problems. You will practice entering numerical and variable
expressions and look at ways to find and correct errors in your

This set of $WW problems will introduce you to the 
$WW system and help you learn how to communicate with the 
software. You will learn how to understand what
you see on the screen and how to enter your answers when you do 
the problems. You will practice entering numerical and variable
expressions and look at ways to find and correct errors in your 
entries.

Start by examining the features of this page you are on right now.  The panels at the left and top help you to navigate to the different pages available in
WeBWorK.  You have already seen the ${LQ}Homework Sets${RQ} page,
which lists all the homework assignments, and the
${LQ}Password/Email${RQ} page, which lets you change your password or
email address.  The ${LQ}Grades${RQ} link takes you to a page that
shows your scores on the various assignments (but there is nothing
much to show at this point).
$PAR


The ${LQ}Report Bugs${RQ} button is for reporting bugs in the WeBWorK
System itself to the developers WeBWorK.  It is unlikely that
you will need to use that yourself.  If you are having difficulty with
WeBWorK, you should contact your professor using the ${LQ}Email
Instructor${RQ} button instead.  This should be available on nearly
every page, so you always have a quick way to reach your professor.
$PAR


The middle panel is the list of homework sets that have
been assigned to you.  These links allow you to go to any assignment
you want to work on.  Right now, you might only have the Orientation set assigned to you, but as the term progresses, the list will grow.
$PAR

The data in the panel at the top of the page tells you where you
are in WeBWorK's hierarchy of pages, but you can ignore that for the
most part.  There is an additional logout button at the far right,
however, that you will need to use when you are done using $WW (don't
press it yet).

#The yellow question mark icon is a ${LQ}Help${RQ}
#button for system documentation, but there is not much of that

The main information on this page is located in the large white area
in the middle.  It shows the status of the problems in this assignment,
and your score on the set so far.  Since you haven't yet tried any of
the problems, your score is zero, but after you work on some of them,
the number of attempts and the score will reflect the work you have
done.
$PAR

Each problem number is a link to that problem in the homework set.
You can click on one to get to any specific problem.  To begin the
orientation assignment, click on the link for Problem 1.  When you are
done working, be sure to dismiss your connection to the server by
clicking on ${LQ}Log Out${RQ}, so that no one else can gain access to
your account.
