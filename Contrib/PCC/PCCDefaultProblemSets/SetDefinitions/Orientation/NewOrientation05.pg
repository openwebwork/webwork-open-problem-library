## Simplifying Answers ##

Your instructor may require you to simplify answers sometimes, and other times simplifying might not be the point of the exercise. For instance, in the following:
    [`[$a]+[$b]=`] [_____]{$c}

You could certainly enter [`[$c]`]. But does it surprise you to learn that you could literally enter [`[$a]+[$b]`] and have it counted correct? In this answer blank, you could enter virtually any expression that would works out to [`[$c]`]. Try finding other creative ways to enter this answer.

On the other hand, here that ability has been turned off; try entering the answer unsimplified:
    [`[$d]+[$e]=`] [_____]{$f}

Are you paying attention to the feedback messages that WeBWorK gives you? Try entering the following _without_ simplifying:
    [``\frac{2}{6}=``] [_____]{$g}
and WeBWorK will tell you that your answer has not yet been simplified.

You might know that [`\sqrt{12}`] can be simplified to [`2\sqrt{3}`]. (This is considered simpler because what is inside the radical is smaller.) But try entering  [`\sqrt{12}`] without any simplification and seeing what the feedback message is:
    [`\sqrt{12}=`] [_____]{$h}


Of course, there will be plenty of times when your instructor will not require answers like these to be simplified. You should just be aware that it is a possibility, and you should monitor WeBWorK's feedback messages. When you are ready, move on to the next question.
