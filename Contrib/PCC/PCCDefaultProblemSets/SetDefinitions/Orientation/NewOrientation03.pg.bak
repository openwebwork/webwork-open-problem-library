## Preview Answer and Order of Operations  ##

WeBWorK understands the order of operations very well, and interprets what you type according to them. Sometimes students will intend to enter an expression like [`5^{2t}`], but not use the right order of operations when typing. WeBWorK wants you to confirm that what you intended to enter is what you actually entered, and so it provides an *Answer Preview* column when you submit any answers. For instance, try the following:

    [`5^{2t}=`] [_____]{Compute("5^(2t)")}

but try entering it as:
:       5^2t
which is incorrect. Go ahead and push the _Submit Answers_ button. Note how the *Answer Preview* column is showing you what WeBWorK thinks you entered. It treats the [$CARET] as higher priority than the multiplication, and computes [`5^2`]. _Then_ it multiplies this by [`t`]. So it sees [`5^2t`]. The correct way to enter [`5^{2t}`] is:
:       5^(2t)
using parentheses to change the priorities according to the order of operations.

The lesson is that if your answer is marked incorrect, along with looking for any feedback messages, you should also look at the *Answer Preview* column and you may see that you have not used grouping symbols well.

Try entering the following correctly: 

    [``\frac{1}{[$a](x+[$c])}=``] [__________]{Compute("1/($a(x+[$c]))")}

    [``\sqrt{[$a] x + [$b]}=``] [__________]{$f}

    [``(t-[$b])^{4t+1}=``] [__________]{$g}

When you have an answer typed into an answer blank and you hit the _enter/return_ key on your keboard, the effect is the same as pushing the *Answer Preview* button. It does _not_ actually submit your answer to see if it is right or wrong; it only lets you see how WeBWorK would interpret what you have typed.

When you are ready, move on to the next question.
