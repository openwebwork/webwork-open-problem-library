Title("When You're Stuck...");

##############################################

BEGIN_TEXT
The goal of $WW is to help you learn mathematics by giving
you immediate feedback on the correctness of your answer to a problem. 
It is not designed to be a tutorial or to replace human teachers. As with any learning tool, it is up to you to make good use of it. 

Here are some things you can try when you are stuck on a problem.
$PAR

\{BeginParList("UL")\}
$ITEM
Reread the problem carefully to see if there are any instructions
that you did not notice.
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
Check carefully for directions on the Problem List page. 
You can get to this page by pressing the ${LQ}Prob. List$RQ button at the 
top of any problem page.
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
Look in the textbook for similar problems or relevant methods.
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
Talk to your instructor during office hours. 
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
Ask a fellow student for help.
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
Use the Student Learning Center. (Be sure to take a printout of
the problem with you if you won't be able to log on to $WW. The tutors will need the ${BITALIC}exact$EITALIC
wording of the problem.)
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
Use the ${LQ}Email instructor$RQ button at the bottom of the problem page
to send e-mail to your instructor. Include the details of
what you have tried so far. If you are having a software problem, 
include details about the error messages you are getting.

$PAR

When you are truly stuck on a $WW problem, you should turn to other
sources (humans or books) for help, because it is not in your best
interest to guess repeatedly instead of thinking about what you might
be doing wrong.  
$PAR

To get credit for this problem, you must click the ${LQ}Submit
Answers$RQ button. Then you can use the ${LQ}Prob. List$RQ button at
the top of the page to return to the problem list page.  You will see
that the problems you have done have been labeled as correct or
incorrect, and you can go back and do problems you skipped or couldn't
get right the first time.  Once you have done a problem correctly, it
is ${BITALIC}always$EITALIC listed as correct even if you go back and
do it incorrectly later.  This means you can use WeBWorK to review
course material without any danger of changing your grade.  $PAR
