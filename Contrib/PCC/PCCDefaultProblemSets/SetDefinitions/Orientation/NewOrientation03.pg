## MathQuill ##

In answer blanks, as you type, math expressions are built. For example if you type the characters [|5^2t|]* it will create [`5^{2t}`]. That is, it will put [|2t|]* up in the exponent and you don't have to see the [|^|]* character.

Also when your cursor is in an answer blank, a math palette tool is available off to the side of the screen. This can help you construct math expressions.

For practice, try typing or using the palette tool to enter these expressions:

    [`5^{2t}=`] [_____]{Compute("5^(2t)")}

    [``\frac{1}{[$a](x+[$c])}=``] [__________]{Compute("1/($a(x+[$c]))")}

    [``\sqrt{[$a] x + [$b]}=``] [__________]{$f}

    [``\frac{t-[$b]}{4t+1}=``] [__________]{$g}

Sometimes you really want an answer to be exactly the way you typed it and not automatically turned into a nice-looking math expression. If this is the case, use the "Tt" button on the palette tool. Or you can type the " key. Either way, you enter what is called "text mode" and whatever you type in the answer blank will be left as it is. Try:

    [``23\,\text{degC}=``] [__________]{NumberWithUnits("23 degC")}

When you are ready, move on to the next question.
