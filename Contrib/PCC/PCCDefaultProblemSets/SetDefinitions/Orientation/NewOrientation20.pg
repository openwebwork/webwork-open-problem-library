## Basic Operations  ##

The four basic arithmetic operations are: 
    [``+, -, \times, \div``]

Each of these has a corresponding character on the keyboard. The first two are found in the upper right area of most keyboards. For [`\times`] (which is also often denoted with [`\cdot`] on paper), we use the asterisk character (\*). This is the shift-8 key on most keyboards.

Try literally entering [`[$a]\cdot[$b]+[$c]`]

    [___________]{Compute($a*$b+$c)->cmp(formatStudentAnswer=>parsed)}

Of course you could also simplify this to [`[$d]`].

Division is typed using the slash character (/), which is in the lower right of most keyboards. Try entering the following:


    [::[$w]=::] [___________]{$w}    

Raising to a power is universally denoted with the caret symbol ([$CARET]). This is usually shift-6 on a keyboard. Try entering the following: 

    [::[$f]=::] [___________]{$f}    

    [::[$g]=::] [___________]{$g}

For [::[$g]::], you need to enter a pair of parenthsis, like [`[$b]\wedge(K+1)`]. If you entered [`[$b]\wedge K+1`], WeBWorK would interpret it as [`[$b]^K+1`], which is incorrect.

This is a good time to point out that capitalization matters. In math, [`k\neq K`]. See what happens if you use the wrong capitalization in the above answers.

When you are ready, move on to the next question.
