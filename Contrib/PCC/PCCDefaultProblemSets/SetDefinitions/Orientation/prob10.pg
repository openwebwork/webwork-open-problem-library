Some problems will ask you to enter an answer that is a point (also known as an ordered pair) rather than a number.  You enter points in $WW just as you would expect:  by separating the coordinates by commas and enclosing them all in
parentheses.  So \{student "(2,-3)"\} represents the point in the
plane that has an \(x\)-coordinate of \(2\) and \(y\)-coordinate of
\(-3\).
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
What point is halfway between \($p0\) and \($p1\)?  \{ans_rule(20)\}.

$PAR
Other problems require you to provide a vector as your answer.  $WW
allows you to enter vectors either as a list of coordinates enclosed
in angle braces, \{student $LANGLE\} and \{student $RANGLE\}, or as a
sum of multiples of the coordinate unit vectors, \(\{i\}\), \(\{j\}\)
and \(\{k\}\), which you enter as \{student "i"\}, \{student "j"\} and
\{student "k"\}.  For example, \{student "${LANGLE}1,3,-2${RANGLE}"\}
represents the same vector as \{student "i+3j-2k"\}.
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
What vector points from the origin to the point \($P\)?  \{ans_rule(20)\}.

Just as you can enter a number by giving an expression that reduces to it,
$WW allows you to enter points and vectors by giving expressions for the
individual coordinates, or by using a vector-valued expression that
reduces to your answer.  For example,
$PAR
$BCENTER
$BNOBR\{student "${LANGLE}1-(-3),2-sqrt(4),6/2${RANGLE}"\}$ENOBR
${SPACING} and ${SPACING}
$BNOBR\{student "[1-(-3)]i + [2-sqrt(4)]j + (6/2)k"\}$ENOBR
$ECENTER
$PAR
both represent the vector \(\{Vector(4,0,3)\}\), while
$BNOBR\{student "${LANGLE}1,0,-1${RANGLE} + ${LANGLE}2,-2,3${RANGLE}"\}$ENOBR
could be used to answer a question that asks for the vector \(\{Vector(3,-2,2)\}\).
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
Try writing \(\{$v0+$v1\}\) as a sum of two vectors:  \{ans_rule(30)\}.
