BEGIN_PGML

An old photograph of your great-grandparents [$ggpa] and [$ggma] was enlarged and framed. The picture's original size was [`[$ain]`] by [`[$bin]`]. After the enlargement, the longer side of the picture was [`[$cin]`]. How long is the shorter side after the enlargement?
 
    After the enlargement, the shorter side was [__________]{$ansin} long.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When enlarging a picture, we would want to increase the sides proportionately, or else the images will appear stretched out.

We consider ratios of the form [`\frac{\textrm{longer side length}}{\textrm{ shorter side length}}`]. 

One such ratio describes the picture before we enlarged it: [`\frac{[$ain] }{[$bin]}`].

Another such ratio describes the picture after we enlarged it, where we currently know the length of the longer side, but not of the shorter side: [`\frac{[$cin]}{x\textrm{ in}}`].

Now we may set up and solve a proportion:


    [``
\begin{aligned}
   \frac{[$a]}{[$b]} &= \frac{[$c]}{x} \\
   [$b]x\cdot\frac{[$a]}{[$b]} &= [$b]x\cdot\frac{[$c]}{x} \\
   x\cdot[$a] &= [$b] \cdot [$c] \\
   [$a]x &= [$b*$c] \\
   \frac{[$a]x}{[$a]} &= \frac{[$b*$c]}{[$a]} \\
   x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
``]

So after the enlargement, the photograph of photograph of [$ggpa] and [$ggma] is [`[$ansin]`] long on its shorter side.
