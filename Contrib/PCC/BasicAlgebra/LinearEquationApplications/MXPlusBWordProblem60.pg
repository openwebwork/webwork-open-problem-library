TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] has [`[$cb]`] in [$possessive] piggy bank. [@ ucfirst($pronoun) @]* plans to purchase some Pokemon cards, which costs [`[$cm]`] each. [@ ucfirst($pronoun) @]* plans to save [`[$cleft]`] to purchase another toy. At most how many Pokemon cards can he purchase?

Write an equation to solve this problem.

    [$name] can purchase at most [__________]{$cards} Pokemon cards.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [$name] can purchase [`x`] Pokemon cards.

Each card costs [`[$cm]`],  so [`x`] cards will cost [`[$m]x`] dollars.

Currently, [$name] has [`[$cb]`] in his piggy bank. After spending [`[$m]x`] dollars, he would have [`[$b]-[$m]x`] dollars left.

[$name] will keep [`[$cleft]`] unspent. Now we can write an equation:

    [`` [$b]-[$m]x = [$left] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$b]-[$m]x &= [$left] \\
  [$b]-[$m]x \mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$left] \mathbf{{}-[$b]} \\
  -[$m]x      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{-[$m]x}{-[$m]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{-[$m]} \\
  x   &= [$cards]
\end{aligned}
`]

[$name] can purchase at most [`[$cards]`] Pokemon cards.
