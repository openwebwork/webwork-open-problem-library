BEGIN_PGML

A certain country in has [`[$b]`] million acres of forest. Every year, the country loses [`[$m]`] million acres of forest mainly due to deforestation for farming purposes. If this situation continues at this pace, how long will it be until the country only has [`[$left]`] million acres of forest left? (Use an equation to solve this problem.)

    After [__________]{$years} years, this country would have [`[$left]`] million acres of forest left.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume after [`y`] years, this country will have [`[$left]`] million acres of forest left.

The country loses [`[$m]`] million acres of forest every year. In [`y`] years, the country will lose a total of [`[$m]y`] million acres of forest.

Currently, the country has [`[$b]`] million acres of forest. In [`y`] years, with a loss of [`[$m]y`] million acres, there would be [`[$b]-[$m]y`] million acres of forest left.

The question asks when there would be [`[$left]`] million acres of forest left. Now we can write an equation:

    [`` [$b]-[$m]y = [$left] ``]

Next, we solve for [`y`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$b]-[$m]y &= [$left] \\
  [$b]-[$m]y \mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$left] \mathbf{{}-[$b]} \\
  -[$m]y      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{-[$m]y}{-[$m]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{-[$m]} \\
  y   &= [$years]
\end{aligned}
`]

After [`[$years]`] years, this country would have [`[$left]`] million acres of forest left.
