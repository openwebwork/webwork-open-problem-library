TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A hockey team played a total of [`[$total]`] games last season. The number of games they won was [`[$dif]`] more than [@numberWord($factor)@] times of the number of games they lost. 

Write and solve an equation to answer the following questions.

    The team lost [_______]{$loss} games. 

    The team won [_______]{$win} games.

$s1=$factor+1;
$s2=$total-$dif;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Suppose that the team lost [`x`] games. Then they won [`[$factor]x+[$dif]`] games.

Since the team played a total of [`[$total]`] games, we can write an equation:

    [`` x+([$factor]x+[$dif])=[$total] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   x+([$factor]x+[$dif])&=[$total] \\
   x+[$factor]x+[$dif]&=[$total] \\
  [$s1]x+[$dif] &= [$total] \\
   [$s1]x+[$dif]\mathbf{{}  -[$dif]} &= [$total]\mathbf{{}  -[$dif]} \\
  [$s1]x      &= [$s2] \\
  \frac{[$s1]x}{[$s1]} &= \frac{[$s2]}{[$s1]} \\
  x   &= [$loss]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

So the team lost [`[$loss]`] games.

Since [`[$factor] \cdot [$loss] + [$dif] = [$win]`], the team won [`[$win]`] games.
