TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] hired a face-painter for a birthday party. The painter charged a flat fee of [`[$ca]`], and then charged [`[$cb]`] per person. 
In the end, [$name] paid a total of [`[$ct]`]. How many people used the face-painter's service?

    [__________]{$ans} people used the face-painter's service.

END_PGML

$s1=$t-$a;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let [`x`] be the number of people who used the face-painter's service.

The charge for each person was [`[$cb]`], so the charge for [`x`] people was [`[$b]x`] dollars. There was also a flat fee of [`[$ca]`].

Now we can write an equation:

    [`` [$b]x+[$a] = [$t] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$b]x +[$a] &= [$t] \\
  [$b]x +[$a]\mathbf{{} -[$a]} &= [$t]\mathbf{{} -[$a]} \\
  [$b]x      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{[$b]x}{[$b]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{[$b]} \\
  x   &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
`]

So [@numberWord($ans)@]* people used the face-painter's service.
