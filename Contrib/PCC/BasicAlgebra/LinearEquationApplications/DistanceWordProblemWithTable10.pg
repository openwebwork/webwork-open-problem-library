BEGIN_PGML

[$name1] runs with a speed of [`[$r1]`] miles per hour. [$name2] runs at [`[$r2]`] miles per hour. They began at the same spot, and started running in opposite directions. After some time, they are [`[$d]`] miles apart. How long have they been running?

You can use a table to organize the quantities (speed, time, and distance) for the two runners. Let's represent the unknown amount of time by [`t`], in hours.

BEGIN_PGML

    According to the table, the total separation between the two runners at time [`t`] is [_______________] miles.

Now set up and solve an equation for [`t`].

    After [______] hours, [$name1] and [$name2] are [`[$d]`] miles apart.

$s1 = $r1+$r2;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR

The relevant formula is:

\[\text{rate}\cdot\text{time} = \text{distance}\]

If we let \(t\) represent the number of hours that $name1 and $name2 have been running, then after \(t\) hours: $PAR

\(\small\bullet\) $name1 has run \($r1 t\) miles.  $BR
\(\small\bullet\) $name2 has run \($r2 t\) miles.  $BR

$PAR
\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Rate",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Time",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Distance",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"$name1",header=>"RH"},"\($r1\)","$SPACE","\(t\)","$SPACE","\($r1 t\)"],
[{data=>"$name2",header=>"RH"},"\($r2\)","$SPACE","\(t\)","$SPACE","\($r2 t\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  

$PAR

And the total separation between them is \($r1 t+$r2 t\) miles.

It is given in the introduction that they ran a total of \($d\) miles. Now we can write an equation and solve it:
$PAR

\[
\begin{aligned}
   $r1 t + $r2 t &= $d  \\
   $s1 t &= $d  \\
   \frac{$s1 t}{$s1 } &= \frac{$d}{$s1} \\
   t &= $t
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR

So $name1 and $name2 have been running for \($t\) hours.
