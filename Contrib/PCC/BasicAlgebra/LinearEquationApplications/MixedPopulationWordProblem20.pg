BEGIN_PGML

Town A and Town B are located closed to each other, and recently merged into one city. Town A used to have [`[$s1]`] residents, with [`[$p1]%`] [$ethnicity]. Town B used to have [`[$p2]%`] [$ethnicity]. After the merge, the new city has [`[$p3]%`] [$ethnicity]. How many residents does the new city have now?

    The new city has [__________]{$s3} residents.

$step1 = $dp2*$s1;
$step2 = $pure1-$step1;
$step3 = $dp3-$dp2;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
Let's let \(x\) represent the number of residents in the new city. Since Town A used to have \($s1\) residents, Town B used to have \(x-$s1\) residents.
$PAR
Town A used to have \($dp1($s1)\) $ethnicity.
$PAR
Town B used to have \($dp2 (x-$s1 )\) $ethnicity.
$PAR
The merged city has \($dp3 (x)\) $ethnicity.

$PAR
We can organize this information into a table:
$PAR
\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Percent of $ethnicity",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Total Number of Residents",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Number of $ethnicity",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"Town A",header=>"RH"},"\($p1%\)","$SPACE","\($s1\)","$SPACE","\($pure1\)"],
[{data=>"Town B",header=>"RH"},"\($p2%\)","$SPACE","\(x-$s1\)","$SPACE","\($dp2 (x-$s1)\)"],
[{data=>"Merged City",header=>"RH"},"\($p3%\)","$SPACE","\(x\)","$SPACE","\($dp3 x\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  

$PAR

Since the two towns merged to make the new city, the number of $ethnicity in the new city should be equal to the sum of the numbers of $ethnicity from the two towns. So we can write an equation and then solve it:
$PAR

\[
\begin{aligned}
   $dp3  x &= $pure1 +$dp2 (x-$s1 ) \\
   $dp3  x &= $pure1 +$dp2 x-$dp2  \cdot $s1  \\
   $dp3  x &= $pure1 +$dp2 x-$step1  \\
   $dp3  x &= $step2 +$dp2 x \\
   $dp3  x \mathbf{{}-$dp2 x} &= $step2 +$dp2 x \mathbf{{}-$dp2 x} \\
   $step3 x &= $step2  \\
   \frac{$step3 x}{$step3 } &= \frac{$step2 }{$step3 } \\
              x       &= $s3 
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
So the merged city has \($s3\) residents.
