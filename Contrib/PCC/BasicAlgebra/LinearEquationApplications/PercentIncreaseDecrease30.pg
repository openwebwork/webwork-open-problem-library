BEGIN_PGML

Your salary used to be [`[$cs]`] per year.

    You earned a [`[$r]%`] raise. After the raise, your salary was [___________]{$cans1} per year.

    Then, you had to take a [`[$r]%`] pay cut. After the cut, your salary was [___________]{$cans2} per year.

END_PGML

$s1 = $r/100;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Your original salary was [`[$cs]`] per year. A [`[$r]%`] raise implies a raise of

    [`` [$s1] \cdot [$cs] = [$s1*$cs] ``] 

After the raise, your salary became [` [$cs]+[$s1*$cs] = [$cans1] `] per year.

Next, a [`[$r]%`] pay cut implies a cut of

    [`` [$s1] \cdot [$cans1] = [$s1*$cans1] ``]

After the cut, your salary became [` [$cans1]-[$s1*$cans1] = [$cans2] `] per year.

After a raise and a cut of the same rate, your salary decreased! This is because the percentage raise was based on a smaller salary, 
while the percentage cut was based on a bigger salary (after the raise).
