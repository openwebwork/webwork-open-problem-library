TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A biologist has been observing a tree's height. This type of tree typically grows by [`[$m]`] feet each month. [@ucfirst(numberWord($x1))@] months into the observation, the tree was [`[$y1]`] feet tall. 

Let [`x`] be the number of months passed since the observations started, and let [`y`] be the tree's height at that time, in feet. Use a linear equation to model the tree's height as the number of months pass.

a) This line's slope-intercept equation is [______________]{$ansSI}.

b) [`[$x3]`] months after the observations started, the tree would be [___________]{$y3} feet in height.

c) [___________]{$x4} months after the observation started, the tree would be [`[$y4]`] feet tall.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in slope-intercept form looks like [` y=mx+b `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`y`] is the [`y`]-coordinate of the [`y`]-intercept. Since the tree grows at a rate of [`[$m]`] feet per month, [`[$m]`] is the slope of the linear model. 

    So now we have that [` y=[$m]x+b `]. The next step is to find the value of [`b`]. There are at least two ways.

    ####One way####
    is to substitute a known point into [` y=[$m]x+b `].  We use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$m] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$s3] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} &= [$s3] + b\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} \\
  [$b] &= b\\
  b &= [$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].

    ####Another way####
    is to use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, we use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m]x+[$m] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m]x+[$s4] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$m]x+[$s4]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$m]x+[$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This is the second way to find [`b`], and thus the line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].
    ----
b)    After [`[$x3]`] months, we can find the height of the tree if we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].  We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  y &= [$m] \cdot [$x3] +[$b] \\
  y &= [$s5]+[$b] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    So after [`[$x3]`] months, the tree is [`[$cy3]`] feet tall.
    ----
c)    To find when the tree was [`[$cy4]`] feet tall, we can substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m]x +[$b] \\
  [$y4]\mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$m]x +[$b]\mathbf{{}-[$b]}\\
  [$s6] &= [$m]x \\
  \frac{[$s6]}{[$m]} &= \frac{[$m]x}{[$m]} \\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    So the tree was [`[$y4]`] feet tall after [`[$x4]`] months.
