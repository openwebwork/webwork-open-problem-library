BEGIN_PGML

[$name1] and [$name2] sold girl scout cookies. [$name1]'s sales were [`[$ca]`] more than [$word] of [$name2]'s. Altogether, their sales were [`[$ct]`]. How much did each girl sell?

    [$name1]'s sales were [_______]{$ch}. 

    [$name2]'s sales were [_______]{$cr}.

$s1=$w+1;
$s2=$t-$a;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Suppose that [$name2]'s income was [`x`] dollars, then [$name1]'s income was [`[$w]x+[$a]`] dollars.

Since their total income was [`[$t]`], we can write an equation:

    [`` x+([$w]x+[$a])=[$t] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  x+[$w]x+[$a]  &= [$t] \\
[$s1]x+[$a]  &= [$t] \\
  [$s1]x+[$a]\mathbf{{}-[$a]} &= [$t]\mathbf{{}-[$a]} \\
  [$s1]x      &= [$s2] \\
  \frac{[$s1]x}{[$s1]} &= \frac{[$s2]}{[$s1]} \\
  x   &= [$r]
\end{aligned}
`]

[$name2]'s sales were [`[$cr]`].

Since [`[$w] \cdot [$r] + [$a] = [$h]`], [$name1]'s sales were [`[$ch]`].
