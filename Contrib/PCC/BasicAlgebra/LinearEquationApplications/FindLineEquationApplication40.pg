BEGIN_PGML

Scientists are conducting an experiment with a gas in a sealed container. The mass of the gas is measured, and the scientists realize that the gas is leaking over time in a linear way. 

[@numberWord($x1,capital=>1)@] minutes since the experiment started, the gas had a mass of [`[$y1]`] grams.

[@numberWord($x2,capital=>1)@] minutes since the experiment started, the gas had a mass of [`[$y2]`] grams.

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes that have passed since the experiment started, and let [`y`] be the mass of the gas in grams at that moment. Use a linear equation to model the weight of the gas over time.

a)  This line's slope-intercept equation is [______________]{$ansSI}.

b)  [`[$x3]`] minutes after the experiment started, there would be [___________]{$y3} grams of gas left.

c)  If a linear model continues to be accurate, [___________]{$x4} minutes since the experiment started, all gas in the container will be gone.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in slope-intercept form looks like [` y=mx+b `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`y`] is the [`y`]-coordinate of the [`y`]-intercept. We first need to find the line's slope. To find the slope, we need two points on the line. We have been given that [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`] are points on the linear model, so we can use the slope formula:

    [`` \text{slope}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} ``]

    First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:

    [`` ([$x1],[$y1]) \longrightarrow (x_{1},y_{1}) ``]

    [`` ([$x2],[$y2]) \longrightarrow (x_{2},y_{2}) ``]

    Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$outputy1]}{[$x2]-[$outputx1]}\\&=\frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]}\\&=[$m] \end{aligned}``]

    This line's slope is [`[$m]`]. This implies that the gas is leaking with a rate of [`[$negm]`] grams per minute.

    So now we have that [` y=[$m]x+b `]. The next step is to find the value of [`b`]. There are at least two ways.

    ####One way####
    is to substitute one of the given points into [` y=[$m]x+b `].  We choose to use [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$m] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$s3] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} &= [$s3] + b\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} \\
  [$b] &= b\\
  b &= [$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].

    ####Another way####
    is to use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, we choose to use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m]x+[$m] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m]x+[$s4] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$m]x+[$s4]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$m]x+[$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This is the second way to find [`b`], and thus the line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].
    ----
b)    After [`[$x3]`] minutes, we can find the mass of the remaining gas if we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].  We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  y &= [$m] \cdot [$x3] +[$b] \\
  y &= [$s5]+[$b] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    So after [`[$x3]`] minutes, there are [`[$y3]`] grams of gas remaining.
    ----
c)    To find when the gas will be all gone, we need to find when there are  [`[$y4]`] grams of gas left.  We can substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m]x +[$b] \\
  [$y4]\mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$m]x +[$b]\mathbf{{}-[$b]}\\
  [$s6] &= [$m]x \\
  \frac{[$s6]}{[$m]} &= \frac{[$m]x}{[$m]} \\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    So after [`[$x4]`] minutes, the gas will be all gone.
