BEGIN_PGML

A biologist wants to estimate the number of fish living in a lake. She caught [`[$a]`] fish, tagged each one, and then released them back into the lake. After a few days, she caught [`[$d]`] fish, and found that [`[$c]`] of them were tagged. Use a proportion to estimate the number of fish living in this lake.
     
    There are approximately [__________]{$ans} fish living in the lake.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We have been asked to use a proportion, so we should consider ratios. We have ratios of the form: [`\frac{\text{tagged fish}}{\text{total tagged and untagged fish}}`].

In the whole lake, we know that there are [`[$a]`] tagged fish, but we do not yet know how many total fish there are. So the ratio describing the entire lake is: [`\frac{[$a]\text{ tagged fish}}{x\text{ total tagged and untagged fish}}`].

The second time she went fishing, the ratio was: [`\frac{[$c]\text{ tagged fish}}{[$d]\text{ total tagged and untagged fish}}`]

These ratios should roughly be equal to each other unless there was something unlucky about the way she caught her second batch of fish. So we set up and solve a proportion.

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   \frac{[$a]}{x} &\approx \frac{[$c]}{[$d]} \\
   [$d]x\cdot\frac{[$a]}{x} &\approx [$d]x\cdot\frac{[$c]}{[$d]} \\
   [$d] \cdot [$a] &\approx x \cdot [$c] \\
   [$d*$a] &\approx [$c]x \\
   \frac{[$d*$a]}{[$c]} &\approx \frac{[$c]x}{[$c]} \\
   [$ans] &\approx x\\
   x &\approx [$ans]
\end{aligned}
``]

So there are approximately [`[$wholenumberans]`] fish living in the lake.
