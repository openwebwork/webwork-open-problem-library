BEGIN_PGML


By your cell phone contract, you pay a monthly fee plus [`[$cm]`] for each minute you spend on the phone. In one month, you spent [`[$x1]`] minutes over the phone, and had a bill totaling [`[$cy1]`].

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes you spend on the phone in a month, and let [`y`] be your total cell phone bill for that month. Use a linear equation to model your monthly bill based on the number of minutes you spend on the phone. 

a) This line's slope-intercept equation is [______________]{$ansSI}.

b) If you spend [`[$x3]`] minutes on the phone in a month, you would be billed [___________]{$cy3}.

c) If your bill was [`[$cy4]`] one month, you must have spent [___________]{$x4} minutes on the phone in that month.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in slope-intercept form looks like [` y=mx+b `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`y`] is the [`y`]-coordinate of the [`y`]-intercept. The slope of the linear model has been given to us: [`[$cm]`] per minute. 

    So now we have that [` y=[$m]x+b `]. The next step is to find the value of [`b`]. There are at least two ways.

    ####One way####
    is to substitute a given point into [` y=[$mx]+b `].  We have the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$mx] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$m] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$s3] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} &= [$s3] + b\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} \\
  [$b] &= b\\
  b &= [$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$mx]+[$b] `].

    ####Another way####
    is to use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, we use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$mx]+[$m] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$mx]+[$s4] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$mx]+[$s4]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$mx]+[$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This is the second way to find [`b`], and thus the line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].
    ----
b)    In one month, you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes on the phone. To find out the bill, we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  y &= [$m] \cdot [$x3] +[$b] \\
  y &= [$s5]+[$b] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    If you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes over the phone in a month, your bill for that month would be [`[$cy3]`].
    ----
c)    In one month, you had a cell phone bill of [`[$cy4]`]. To find how many minutes you spent on the phone that month, we substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m]x +[$b] \\
  [$y4]\mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$m]x +[$b]\mathbf{{}-[$b]}\\
  [$s6] &= [$m]x \\
  \frac{[$s6]}{[$m]} &= \frac{[$m]x}{[$m]} \\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    If your bill was [`[$cy4]`] in one month, you must have spent [`[$x4]`] minutes on the phone.
