BEGIN_PGML

[$name] left a [`[$a]%`] tip for [$modify] dinner out. The total charge including the tip was [`[$cb]`]. How much was the dinner bill without including the tip?

    Without including the tip, the dinner bill was [___________]{$cans}.

END_PGML

$s1 = $a/100;
$s2 = 1+$s1;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let the dinner bill (without including the tip) be [`x`] dollars.

A [`[$a]%`] tip implies the tip was [`[$s1]x`] dollars. So the total charge including the tip was [`x+[$s1]x`] dollars, which is [`[$s2]x`] dollars.

Now we can set up an equation:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$s2]x &= [$b] \\
  \frac{[$s2]x}{[$s2]} &= \frac{[$b]}{[$s2]} \\
  x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    `]

Without including the tip, the dinner bill was [`[$cans]`].
