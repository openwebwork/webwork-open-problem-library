BEGIN_PGML

By your cell phone contract, you pay a monthly fee plus some money for each minute you use the phone during the month. In one month, you spent [`[$x1]`] minutes on the phone, and paid [`[$cy1]`]. In another month, you spent [`[$x2]`] minutes on the phone, and paid [`[$cy2]`].

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes you talk over the phone in a month, and let [`y`] be your cell phone bill for that month. Use a linear equation to model your monthly bill based on the number of minutes you talk over the phone. 

a) This linear model's slope-intercept equation is [______________]{$ansSI}.

b) If you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes over the phone in a month, you would pay [___________]{$cy3}.

c) If in a month, you paid [`[$cy4]`] of cell phone bill, you must have spent [___________]{$x4} minutes on the phone in that month.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in slope-intercept form looks like [` y=mx+b `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`y`] is the [`y`]-coordinate of the [`y`]-intercept. We first need to find the line's slope. To find the slope, we need two points on the line. We have been given that [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`] are points on the linear model, so we can use the slope formula:

    [`` \text{slope}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} ``]

    First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:

    [`` ([$x1],[$y1]) \longrightarrow (x_{1},y_{1}) ``]

    [`` ([$x2],[$y2]) \longrightarrow (x_{2},y_{2}) ``]

    Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$outputy1]}{[$x2]-[$outputx1]}\\&=\frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]}\\&=[$m] \end{aligned}``]

    This line's slope is [`[$m]`]. This implies you have to pay [`[$cm]`] per minute that you use the phone.

    So now we have that [` y=[$m]x+b `]. The next step is to find the value of [`b`]. There are at least two ways.

    ####One way####
    is to substitute one of the given points into [` y=[$m]x+b `].  We choose to use [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$m] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$s3] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} &= [$s3] + b\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} \\
  [$b] &= b\\
  b &= [$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].

    ####Another way####
    is to use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, we choose to use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m]x+[$m] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m]x+[$s4] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$m]x+[$s4]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$m]x+[$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This is the second way to find [`b`], and thus the line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].
    ----
b)    In one month, you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes on the phone. To find out the bill, we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  y &= [$m] \cdot [$x3] +[$b] \\
  y &= [$s5]+[$b] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    If you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes over the phone in a month, your bill for that month would be [`[$cy3]`].
    ----
c)    In one month, you had a cell phone bill of [`[$cy4]`]. To find how many minutes you spent on the phone that month, we substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m]x +[$b] \\
  [$y4]\mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$m]x +[$b]\mathbf{{}-[$b]}\\
  [$s6] &= [$m]x \\
  \frac{[$s6]}{[$m]} &= \frac{[$m]x}{[$m]} \\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    If your bill was [`[$cy4]`] in one month, you must have spent [`[$x4]`] minutes on the phone.
