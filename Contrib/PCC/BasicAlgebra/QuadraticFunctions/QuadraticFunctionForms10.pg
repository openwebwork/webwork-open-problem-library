BEGIN_PGML

The quadratic expression [`[$vertexform]`] is written in vertex form.

a. Write the expression in standard form.

    [_________________]{$expandedform}

b. Write the expression in factored form.

    [_________________]{$factoredform}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. If we expand the given polynomial:

    [`\begin{aligned} [$vertexform] & = (x-[$h])(x-[$h])-[$k]\\
&= x^2-[$h]x-[$h]x+[$h]^2-[$k]\\
&= [$expandedform]\end{aligned}`]

b. One way to find the factored form is to examine the expanded form, and factor it in the usual way. Here we look for two numbers that multiply to [@$p[0]@] and add to [@-1*$p[1]@]. Two such numbers are [@$a@] and [@-1*$b@]. Since the leading coefficient is [`1`], these two numbers are the constant terms of two factors. And the factored form is

    [`[$factoredform]`]

    Another way to find the factored form is to find the roots of the polynomial. If we set the vertex form equal to [`0`], we find

    [`\begin{aligned} [$vertexform] &= 0\\
(x-[$h])^2&=[$k]\\
x-[$h]&= [@sqrt($k)@]&&\text{or }&x-[$h]&=-[@sqrt($k)@]\\
x&=[$b]&&\text{or }&x&=-[$a]\end{aligned}`]

    With these two roots, the factored form of the equation must be 

    [`k(x-(-[$a]))(x-[$b])`]

    Since the leading coefficient is [`1`], [`k`] must be [`1`], and the factored form is [`[$factoredform]`].
