# Template:
# Factor the given polynomial 
#
#     a x^2 + (b+ac) x + bc
#
# The answer is
#
#     (a x + b)( x + c)
#
# We make sure that gcd(a,b)=1
#
#
# b, c are non-zero, integer on the interval [1,10],
# one of them is positive, one is negative.
#
# We choose a integer on {4,6,8}, which 
# makes the problem interesting because
# one starting point for finding the solution
# is
#       (2x- )(2x+ )
#       (3x- )(2x+ )
#       (4x- )(2x+ )
#       (2x+ )(2x- )
#       (3x+ )(2x- )
#       (4x+ )(2x- )

BEGIN_PGML
Factor the given polynomial 

    [`[$question]=`] [___________________]{$ans}

If the expression cannot be factored then answer with *prime*.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To factor this expression we make the following observations:
* the leading coefficient is [`[$leading]`] which is *not* prime
* the last term is _negative_ which means that the factorization
could have any of the following forms

      [`
        \begin{aligned}
            ([$a][$var]+\phantom{3})([$var]-\phantom{3})&\\
            ([$a/2][$var]+\phantom{3})(2[$var]-\phantom{3})&\\
            ([$a][$var]-\phantom{3})([$var]+\phantom{3})&\\
            ([$a/2][$var]-\phantom{3})(2[$var]+\phantom{3})&
        \end{aligned}
       `]

We look for factors of [`[$end]`] that add to [`[$middle]`] when combined with 
the factors of [`[$leading]`] in the correct way; the 
factors that work are [`[$b]`] and [`[$c]`] so

    [`[$question]=[$ans]`]

Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL (*F*irst *O*utside *I*nside *L*ast) technique (exercise).

#### Alternative Approach using the "AC" method:

To factor a trinomial of the form [`Ax^2+Bx+C`], we can begin by multipling [`A`] and [`C`] together. Here, 

    [`\begin{aligned}A\cdot C&=[$leading]\cdot[$end]\\&=[$leading*$end]\end{aligned}`]

Now we search for two numbers that multiply to [`[$leading*$end]`], and add to the middle term's coefficient, [`[$middle]`]. In this case we find that [`[$group1]`] and [`[$group2]`] work. Now we use these to separate the middle term into two parts.

    [`\begin{aligned}[$question] &= [$leading][$var]^2+[$group1][$var]+[$group2][$var]+[$end]\end{aligned}`]

If we have done these steps correctly, then it is _guaranteed_ that the factoring by grouping method will work for completing the factoring.

    [`\begin{aligned}[$question] &= [$leading][$var]^2+[$group1][$var]+[$group2][$var]+[$end]\\
&=[$a][$var]([$var]+[$c])+[$b]([$var]+[$c])\\
&=[$ans]
\end{aligned}`]
