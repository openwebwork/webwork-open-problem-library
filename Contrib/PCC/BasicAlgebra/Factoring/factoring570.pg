#
# Template:
# Factor the given polynomial 
#
#     ac x^n+2 + (bc+ad) x^n+1 + bd x^n
#
# The answer is
#
#     x^n(a x + b)( c x + d)
# 
# a = c 
# b = d = 1
#
# So this problem becomes 
#
#      x^n(a^2 x^2 + 2 a x + 1) = x^n (a x + 1)(ax +1)

If the expression cannot be factored then answer with *prime*.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let's start by factoring [`[$var]^{[$n]}`] from each term

     [`
        [$question] = [$step0]
     `]

We now need to find factors of [`[$end]`] that when combined with the 
factors of [`[$leading]`] give [`[$middle]`];
this problem is an example of _the square of the sum of two terms_

     [`
                [$question]  = [$ans]
     `]

You might have written

     [`
                [$question]  = [$step]
     `]

which is also correct.

Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL (*F*irst *O*utside *I*nside *L*ast) technique (exercise).

####Alternative Approach

When factoring, we should always first look for any greatest common factors of the terms. Here we find that [`[$var]^[$n]`] is such a factor, and we have

    [`
        [$question] = [$step0]
    `]

To factor the remaining trinomial further, note that its leading term and its final term are perfect squares. Their square roots are [`[$a][$var]`] and [`[@abs([$b])@]`]. After multiplying their square roots, we have [`[@$a*abs([$b])@][$var]`], which is [%(negative)%] half of the middle term. When all this happens, we have a perfect square trinomial, and the two square roots we found make the binomial that should be squared. [%Since the middle coefficient was negative, the binomial should be a difference, not a sum.%] That is,

     [`
                [$question] = [$step]
     `]
