#
# Template:
# Factor the given polynomial 
#
#     ac x^2 + (bc+ad) xy + bd y^2
#
# The answer is
#
#     (a x + b y)( c x + d y)
# 
# a = c = 1
# b = d
#
# b and d are negative.
#
# So this problem becomes 
#
#       x^2 + 2 b x + ab

TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML
Factor the given polynomial 

    [`[$question]=`] [___________________]{$ans}

If the expression cannot be factored then answer with *prime*.
END_PGML

$step = Formula("($a*$var1+$b$var2)^2")->reduce;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We need to find factors of [`[$end]`] that, when added, give [`[$middle]`];
this problem is an example of _the square of the difference of two terms_

     [`
                [$question]  = [$ans]
     `]

You might have written

     [`
                [$question]  = [$step]
     `]

which is also correct.

Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL (*F*irst *O*utside *I*nside *L*ast) technique (exercise).

####Alternative Approach

Note that the leading term and the final term are perfect squares. Their square roots are [`[$var1]`] and [`[@abs([$b])@][$var2]`]. After multiplying their square roots, we have [`[@$a*abs([$b])@][$var1][$var2]`], which is (negative) half of the middle term. When all this happens, we have a perfect square trinomial, and the two square roots we found make the binomial that should be squared. Since the middle coefficient was negative, the binomial should be a difference, not a sum. That is,

     [`
                [$question] = [$step]
     `]
