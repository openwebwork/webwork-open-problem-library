BEGIN_PGML
Factor the given polynomial 

    [`[$question]=`] [___________________]{$ans}

If the expression cannot be factored then answer with *prime*.
END_PGML

$step1 = Formula("$d$var^$n($leading*$var^2+$middle*$var+$end)")->reduce;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let's start by noting that [`[$d][$var]^{[$n]}`] is a common factor to each term, so 
we may write

        [`[$question]=[$step1]`]

To factor this expression further we make the following observations:
* the leading coefficient is [`[$leading]`] which is _prime_
* the middle term's coefficient and the last term are _positive_ which means that the factorization
will have the form

      [`([$a][$var]+\phantom{3})([$var]+\phantom{3})`]

We look for factors of [`[$end]`] that add to [`[$middle]`] when combined with 
the [`[$leading]`] in the correct way; the 
factors that work are [`[$b]`] and [`[$c]`] so

    [`[$question]=[$ans]`]

Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL (*F*irst *O*utside *I*nside *L*ast) technique (exercise).

#### Alternative Approach using the "AC" method:

When factoring, we should always check to see if there is a greatest common factor to factor out first. Here, [`[$d][$var]^[$n]`] is such a factor, and we have

    [`[$question]=[$step1]`]

Now we try to further factor the trinomial. To factor a trinomial of the form [`Ax^2+Bx+C`], we can begin by multiplying [`A`] and [`C`] together. Here, 

    [`\begin{aligned}A\cdot C&=[$leading]\cdot[$end]\\&=[$leading*$end]\end{aligned}`]

Now we search for two numbers that multiply to [`[$leading*$end]`], and add to the middle term's coefficient, [`[$middle]`]. In this case we find that [`[$a*$c]`] and [`[$b]`] work. Now we use these to separate the middle term into two parts.

    [`\begin{aligned}[$question] &= [$step1]\\
&=[$d][$var]^[$n]([$leading][$var]^2+[$a*$c][$var]+[$b][$var]+[$end])\end{aligned}`]

If we have done these steps correctly, then it is _guaranteed_ that the factoring by grouping method will work for completing the factoring.

    [`\begin{aligned}[$question] &= [$step1]\\
&=[$d][$var]^[$n]([$leading][$var]^2+[$a*$c][$var]+[$b][$var]+[$end])\\
&=[$d][$var]^[$n]([$a][$var]([$var]+[$c])+[$b]([$var]+[$c]))\\
&=[$ans]
\end{aligned}`]
