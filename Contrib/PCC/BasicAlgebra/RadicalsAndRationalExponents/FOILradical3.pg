#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Multiply by using the FOIL method. Simplify and combine like radicals
if necessary. Use sqrt for the square root symbol (Example: [``\sqrt{2} =``]
sqrt(2).)

[``([$sqrt1] + [$sqrt2])([$sqrt1] - [$sqrt2]) =``] [__________________]{$answer}

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this
#feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and
#may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a
#walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Use the FOIL method to multiply these binomial expressions together, or notice
that we have the difference of squares formula:

    [`` (A+B)(A-B)=A^{2}-B^{2} ``]

We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
    ([$sqrt1] + [$sqrt2])([$sqrt1] - [$sqrt2])
               &= \left([$sqrt1]\right)^2 - \left([$sqrt2]\right)^2 \\
               &= [$coeff1]^2 \cdot [$radicand1] - [$coeff2]^2 \cdot [$radicand2] \\
               &= [$coeff1**2 * $radicand1] - [$coeff2**2 * $radicand2] \\
               &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
