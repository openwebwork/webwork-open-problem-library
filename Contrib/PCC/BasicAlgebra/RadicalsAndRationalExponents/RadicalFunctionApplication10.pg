BEGIN_PGML

If an object is dropped with no initial velocity, the time since the drop, in seconds, can be calculated by the function

    [`` T(h) = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} ``]

where [`h`] is the distance the object traveled in feet. The variable [`g`] is the gravitational acceleration on earth, and we can round it to [`32 \frac{ft}{s^2}`] for this problem. Answer the following questions. Round your answers to two decimal places if needed.

1) After [__________]{$ans1} seconds since the release, the object would have traveled [`[$a]`] feet. 

2) After [`[$b]`] seconds since the release, the object would have traveled [__________]{$ans2} feet.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

1) After how many seconds since the release, would the object have traveled [`[$a]`] feet?

To answer this question, we substitute [`h`] with [`[$a]`], (and [`g`] with 32 as stated above) and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   T(h) &=  \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \\
   T([$a]) &= \sqrt{\frac{2([$a])}{32}} \\
   T([$a]) &\approx [$ans1] 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

After approximately [`[$ans1Show]`] seconds since the release, the object would have traveled [`[$a]`] feet. 

2) After [`[$b]`] seconds since the release, how many feet would the object have traveled?

To answer this question, we substitute [`T(h)`] with [`[$b]`], and then solve for [`h`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   T(h) &=  \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \\
   [$b] &= \sqrt{\frac{2h}{32}} \\
   [$b] &= \sqrt{\frac{h}{16}} \\
   ([$b])^2 &= \left( \sqrt{\frac{h}{16}} \right)^2 \\
   [$b*$b] &= \frac{h}{16} \\
   [$b*$b] \cdot 16 &= h \\
   h &= [$ans2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

After [`[$b]`] seconds since the release, the object would have traveled  [`[$ans2Show]`] feet.
