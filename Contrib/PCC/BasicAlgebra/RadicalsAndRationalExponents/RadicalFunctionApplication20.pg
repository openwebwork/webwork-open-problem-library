BEGIN_PGML

A factory manufactures toy plastic balls. For a ball with a certain volume, V in cubic centimeters, the ball's radius can be calculated by the formula

    [`` r(V) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} ``]

Answer the following questions. 

* Don't round [`\pi`] to [`3.14`] at the beginning, use your calculator's [`\pi`] button instead. 
* At the end of your calculation, round your answers to two decimal places if needed.

1) If a ball's volume is [`[$a]`] cubic centimeters, its radius must be [__________]{$ans1} centimeters.

2) If a ball's radius is [`[$b]`] centimeters, its volume would be [__________]{$ans2} cubic centimeters.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

1) If a ball's volume is [`[$a]`] cubic centimeters, how many centimeters must its radius be?

To answer this question, we substitute [`V`] with [`[$a]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   r(V) &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \\
   r([$a]) &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3([$a])}{4 \pi}} \\
   r([$a]) &\approx [$ans1] 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If a ball's volume is [`[$a]`] cubic centimeters, its radius must be approximately [`[$ans1Show]`] centimeters.

2) If a ball's radius is [`[$b]`] centimeters, what's its volume?

To answer this question, we substitute [`r(V)`] with [`[$b]`], and then solve for [`V`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   r(V) &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \\
   [$b] &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \\
   ([$b])^3 &= (\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}})^3 \\
   [$b3] &= \frac{3V}{4 \pi} \\
   [$b3] \cdot (4 \pi) &= \frac{3V}{4 \pi} \cdot (4 \pi)  \\
   [$b3*4] \pi &= 3V \\
   \frac{[$b3*4] \pi}{3} &= \frac{3V}{3} \\
   V & \approx [$ans2] \text{   (Don't forget } \bfont{\pi} \text{!)}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If a ball's radius is [`[$b]`] centimeters, its volume would be approximately [`[$ans2Show]`] cubic centimeters.
