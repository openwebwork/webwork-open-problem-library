Solve the following system of equations, using whichever method you wish.

    [`\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.`]

* If there is one solution, enter it as an ordered pair.
* If there is no solution, enter *no solution*. Spelling counts.
* If there is an infinite number of solutions, enter *infinite number of solutions*. Spelling counts.
