# Solve the system of linear equations

# where a, b, c, d are (positive) integer values on the interval [1,5]
#

Solve the following system of equations.

  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.```]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION 
* If we solve each equation for [`y`] then we obtain

    [`
     \begin{aligned}
      y & = [$top] \\
      y& = [$bot]
    \end{aligned}
    `]

* We immediately observe that the lines are _parallel_ since they have the same slopes. 
* We also note that the lines have different vertical intercepts.
* We conclude that there are *no solutions* to this system.

Note that you may have attempted this problem using another method, perhaps trying the 
method of elimination or substitution. If we had tried to solve the system by elimination, 
we might have multiplied the first equation by [`[$constant]`], which gives

    [`\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.`]

Subtracting these two equations gives

    [`
        0 = [$e-$f]
`]

which is clearly a _false_ statement; the conclusion is that there are *no solutions* to this system.
