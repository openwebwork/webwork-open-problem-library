#
# Solve the system of linear equations
#     a x + b y = e
#     c x + d y = f
# where a, b, c, d are (positive) integer values on the interval [1,5]
#
# We choose ad - bc = 0, so that there is no solution to this system.

# There are no solutions to this system

TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Solve the following system of equations, using whichever method you wish.

    [`\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.`]

* If there is one solution, enter it as an ordered pair.
* If there is no solution, enter *no solution*. Spelling counts.
* If there is an infinite number of solutions, enter *infinite number of solutions*. Spelling counts.

Context("Fraction");
Context()->noreduce('(-x)-y'=>0,'(-x)+y'=>0);
$slope1 = Fraction(-$a,$b);
$yint1 = Fraction($e,$b);

$slope2 = Fraction(-$c,$d);
$yint2 = Fraction($f,$d);

$top = Formula("$slope1 x + $yint1")->reduce;
$bot = Formula("$slope2 x + $yint2")->reduce;

# for the solution
Context()->variables->are(x=>'Real',y=>'Real');
$topLeft = Formula("$constant*$a*x+$constant*$b*y")->reduce;
$e = $e*$constant;


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION 
* If we solve each equation for [`y`] then we obtain

    [`
     \begin{aligned}
      y & = [$top] \\
      y& = [$bot]
    \end{aligned}
    `]

* We immediately observe that the lines are _parallel_ since they have the same slopes. 
* We also note that the lines have different vertical intercepts.
* We conclude that there are *no solutions* to this system.

Note that you may have attempted this problem using another method, perhaps trying the 
method of elimination or substitution. If we had tried to solve the system by elimination, 
we might have multiplied the first equation by [`[$constant]`], which gives

    [`\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.`]

Subtracting these two equations gives

    [`
        0 = [$e-$f]
`]

which is clearly a _false_ statement; the conclusion is that there are *no solutions* to this system.
