BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

If a point is a solution to a system of linear equations, it implies the point is on both lines.

To decide whether a given point is a solution to a system of equations or not, we need to know whether or not the point is on both lines.

Substituting the point [`([$x],[$y])`] into the first equation, we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$func1] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$c] \\
   [$firstEquationSubstitute] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$c] \\
   [$firstEquationValue] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$c]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

This is true, so [`([$x],[$y])`] is on the line [` [$func1]=[$c] `].

Next, we substitute [`([$x],[$y])`] into the second equation, and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$func2] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$f] \\
   [$secondEquationSubstitute] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$f] \\
   [$secondEquationValue] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$f]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

This is also true, so [`([$x],[$y])`] is on the line [` [$func2]=[$f] `].

Since [`([$x],[$y])`] is on both lines, [`([$x],[$y])`] is a solution tp the system of equations.

This is false, so [`([$x],[$y])`] is not on the line [` [$func2]=[$f] `].

Since [`([$x],[$y])`] is not on _both_ lines, [`([$x],[$y])`] is not a solution to the system of equations.

This is not true, so [`([$x],[$y])`] is not on the line [` [$func1]=[$c] `], and thus is not a solution to the system of equations.

There is no need to check whether [`([$x],[$y])`] is on the line [` [$func2]=[$f] `].
