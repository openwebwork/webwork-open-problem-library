# Subtract two fractions. Denominators are small. Denominators are quite different. Negative minus positive fractions. The first fraction's denominator goes into the second fraction's denominator. Solution can be reduced.

TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

Subtract one fraction from the other: [``-\frac{[$num1]}{[$den1]}-\frac{[$num2]}{[$den2]}``]

When needed, use an improper fraction in your answer. Don't use a mixed number.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To add or subtract two fractions with different denominators, we first have to find the common denominator. 

In this case, the least common multiple of [`[$den1]`] and [`[$den2]`] is [`[$commonDenominator]`].

Look at the first fraction [``-\frac{[$num1]}{[$den1]}``]. To change the denominator to [`[$commonDenominator]`], we multiply [`[$times]`] at both the top and bottom, and we have:

    [`` \begin{aligned}-\frac{[$num1]}{[$den1]} &= -\frac{[$num1] \cdot [$times]}{[$den1] \cdot [$times]}\\ &= -\frac{[$num11]}{[$den11]} \end{aligned}``]

Since the second fraction's denominator is the same as the common denominator, there is no need to make changes to the second fraction.

Finally, we add or subtract the numerators and keep the common denominator unchanged. The whole process is:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   -\frac{[$num1]}{[$den1]}-\frac{[$num2]}{[$den2]} &= -\frac{[$num11]}{[$den11]}-\frac{[$num2]}{[$den2]} \\
   &= \frac{-[$num11]+(-[$num2])}{[$den2]} \\
   &= -\frac{[$num3]}{[$den2]} & \hbox{We can divide both the numerator and denominator by [$dividend] to reduce this.
}\\
   &= [$neg]\frac{[$numAns]}{[$denAns]}
\end{aligned}
    ``]
