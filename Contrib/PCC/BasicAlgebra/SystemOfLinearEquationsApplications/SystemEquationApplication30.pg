BEGIN_PGML

[$name] invested a total of [`[$cInit]`] in two accounts. After a year, one account lost [`[$p1]%`], while the other account gained [`[$p2]%`]. In total, [$name] lost [`[$cTotalInt]`]. How much money did [$name] invest in each account?

Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following questions.

    [$name] invested [__________]{$cFund1} in the account with [`[$p1]%`] loss.

    [$name] invested [__________]{$cFund2} in the account with [`[$p2]%`] gain.

$s1= $dp1*$rInit;
$s2=$dp2+$dp1;
$s3= -$rTotalInt+$s1;

if ($s2!=1) {
   $output = " $s2 y &= $s3 \\".
             " \frac{$s2 y}{$s2} &= \frac{$s3}{$s2} \\";
}
else {$output = "";}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [$name] invested [`x`] dollars in the account with [`[$p1]%`] loss, and [`y`] dollars in the account with [`[$p2]%`] gain.

It's given that the total amount of investment was [`[$cInit]`], so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$rInit] ``]

Since the first account lost [`[$p1]%`] for [`x`] dollars, the amount of loss was [`[$dp1]x`] dollars.

Similarly, since the second account gained [`[$p2]%`] for [`y`] dollars, the amount of gain was [`[$dp2]y`] dollars.

It's given that the total amount of loss was [`[$cTotalInt]`], so we have:

    [`` -[$dp1]x+[$dp2]y= -[$rTotalInt] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$rInit] \\
  -[$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= -[$rTotalInt]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We use elimination to solve this system of equations. To eliminate [`x`], we multiply each side of [` x + y = [$rInit] `] by [`[$dp1]`], and we have:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$dp1]x +[$dp1]y  &= [$s1] \\
  -[$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= -[$rTotalInt]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Adding left sides together and right sides together, and then solving for [`y`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
  [$output]
  y   &= [$rFund2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`y=[$rFund2]`] into [` x+y=[$rInit] `] and we have [`x=[$rFund1]`].

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$rFund1],[$rFund2])`]. This implies that [$name] invested [`[$cFund1]`] in the account with [`[$p1]%`] loss and [`[$cFund2]`] in the account with [`[$p2]%`] gain.
