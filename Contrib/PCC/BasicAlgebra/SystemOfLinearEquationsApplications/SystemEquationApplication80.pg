BEGIN_PGML

Phone Company A charges a monthly fee of [`[$cFlatA]`], and [`[$cRateA]`] for each minute of talk time.

Phone Company B charges a monthly fee of [`[$cFlatB]`], and [`[$cRateB]`] for each minute of talk time.

Write and solve a system equation to answer the following questions.

    These two companies would charge the same amount on a monthly bill when the talk time was [__________]{$minutes} minutes.

$s1= $rFlatB - $rFlatA;
$s2= $rRateA - $rRateB;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes of talk time in a given month. Let [`y`] be the bill in that month.

We can model Company A's bill by [`y=[$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA]`].

We can model Company B's bill by [`y=[$rRateB]x+[$rFlatB]`].

To find the conditions under which these two companies will charge the same amount on a monthly bill, we solve the system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  y &=[$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA]\\
  y &=[$rRateB]x+[$rFlatB]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

It's easier to use substitution to solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we have [`y=[$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA]`]. In the second equation, we can substitute [`y`] with [`[$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned} [t]
  [$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA] &=[$rRateB]x+[$rFlatB] \\
  [$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA] \mathbf{{}-[$rFlatA]} &=[$rRateB]x+[$rFlatB] \mathbf{{}-[$rFlatA]} \\
  [$rRateA]x &= [$rRateB]x +[$s1] \\
  [$rRateA]x \mathbf{{}-[$rRateB]x} &= [$rRateB]x +[$s1] \mathbf{{}-[$rRateB]x} \\
  [$s2] x &= [$s1] \\ 
  \frac{[$s2]x}{[$s2]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]} \\
  x &= [$minutes]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`x=[$minutes]`] into [`y =[$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned} [t]
   y &=[$rRateA]x+[$rFlatA] \\
   y &=[$rRateA] \cdot [$minutes]+[$rFlatA] \\
   y &=[$rSameBill]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$minutes],[$rSameBill])`]. This implies both companies will charge [`[$cSameBill]`] if a person spent [`[$minutes]`] minutes talking on the phone that month.
