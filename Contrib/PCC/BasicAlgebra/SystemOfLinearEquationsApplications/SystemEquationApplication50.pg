BEGIN_PGML

You poured some [`[$p1]%`] alcohol solution and some [`[$p2]%`] alcohol solution into a mixing container. Now you have [`[$s3]`] grams of [`[$p3] %`] alcohol solution. How many grams of [`[$p1]%`] solution and how many grams of [`[$p2] %`] solution did you pour into the mixing container?

Write and solve a system equation to answer the following questions.

    You mixed [__________]{$s1} grams of [`[$p1]%`] solution with [__________]{$s2} grams of [`[$p2]%`] solution.

$step1 = -$dp1*$s3;
$step2 = $dp2-$dp1;
$step3 = $dp3*$s3;
$step4 = Real("$step3 + $step1");

if ($step2!=1) {
   $output = " $step2 y &= $step4 \\".
             " \frac{$step2 y}{$step2} &= \frac{$step4}{$step2} \\";
}
else {$output = "";}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume you poured [`x`] grams of [`[$p1] %`] solution and [`y`] grams of [`[$p2] %`] solution into the mixing vessel.

It's given that the mixture weighs [`[$s3]`] grams, so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$s3] ``]

Since the [`[$p1]%`] solution weighs [`x`] grams, it contains [`[$dp1]x`] grams of pure alcohol.

Similarly, since the [`[$p2]%`] solution weighs [`y`] grams, it contains [`[$dp2]y`] grams of pure alcohol.

The [`[$p3]%`] mixture weighs [`[$s3]`] grams, so it contains [`[$dp3] \cdot [$s3] = [$step3] `] of pure alcohol. Now we can write another equation:

    [`` [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y= [$step3] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$s3] \\
  [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= [$step3]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We use elimination to solve this system of equations. To eliminate [`x`], we multiply each side of [` x + y = [$s3] `] by [`-[$dp1]`], and we have:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  -[$dp1]x -[$dp1]y  &= [$step1] \\
  [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= [$step3]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Adding left sides together and right sides together, and then solving for [`y`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
  [$output]
  y   &= [$s2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`y=[$s2]`] into [` x+y=[$s3] `], and we have [`x=[$s1]`].

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$s1],[$s2])`]. This implies that you mixed [`[$s1]`] grams of [`[$p1]%`] solution with [`[$s2]`] grams of [`[$p2]%`] solution.
