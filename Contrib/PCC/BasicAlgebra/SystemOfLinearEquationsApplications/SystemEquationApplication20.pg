BEGIN_PGML

[$name] invested a total of [`[$cInit]`] in two accounts. One account pays [`[$p1]%`] interest annually; the other pays [`[$p2]%`] interest annually. At the end of the year, [$name] earned a total of [`[$cTotalInt]`] in interest. Write and solve a system of equations to find how much money [$name] invested in each account.

    [$name] invested [__________]{$cFund1} in the [`[$p1]%`] account and [__________]{$cFund2} in the [`[$p2]%`] account.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [$name] invested [`x`] dollars in the [`[$p1]%`] account, and [`y`] dollars in the [`[$p2]%`] account.

It's given that the total amount of investment was [`[$cInit]`], so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$rInit] ``]

Since the first account generated [`[$p1]%`] of interest for [`x`] dollars, the amount of interest was [`[$dp1]x`] dollars.

Similarly, since the second account generated [`[$p2]%`] of interest for [`y`] dollars, the amount of interest was [`[$dp2]y`] dollars.

It's given that the total amount of interest was [`[$cTotalInt]`], so we have:

    [`` [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y=[$rTotalInt] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$rInit] \\
  [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= [$rTotalInt]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We use elimination to solve this system of equations. To eliminate [`x`], we multiply each side of [` x + y = [$rInit] `] by [`-[$dp1]`], and we have:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  -[$dp1]x -[$dp1]y  &= [$s1] \\
  [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= [$rTotalInt]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Adding corresponding sides of both equations, and then solving for [`y`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$output]
  y   &= [$rFund2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`y=[$rFund2]`] into [` x+y=[$rInit] `], and we find [`x=[$rFund1]`].

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$rFund1],[$rFund2])`]. This implies [$name] invested [`[$cFund1]`] in the [`[$p1]%`] account and [`[$cFund2]`] in the [`[$p2]%`] account.
