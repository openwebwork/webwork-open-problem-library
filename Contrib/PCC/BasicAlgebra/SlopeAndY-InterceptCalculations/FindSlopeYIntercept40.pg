BEGIN_PGML

A line has the equation [` y=-x+[$b] `]. Find this line's slope and [`y`]-intercept. If either of these do not exist, you may enter *DNE* or *NONE*.

    This line's slope is [_______]{$m}.

    This line's [`y`]-intercept is [_______].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When an equation of a line is written in the form [` y=mx+b `], it is said to be in *slope-intercept form*. In this form, [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the coordinate on the [`y`]-axis where the line intercepts the [`y`]-axis.

In this problem, the line's equation is given as [` y= -x+[$b] `]. Since there is no written coefficient (except for a negative symbol) for [`x`], we have to think of the first term as [`-1 \cdot x`].

Thus its slope is [`[$m]`], and its [`y`]-intercept has coordinates [` (0,[$b]) `].
