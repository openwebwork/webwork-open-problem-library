BEGIN_PGML

A line has the equation [`` y= -\frac{[$num]x}{[$den]} +[$b] ``]. Find this line's slope and [`y`]-intercept. If either of these do not exist, you may enter *DNE* or *NONE*.

    This line's slope is [_______]{$m}.

    This line's [`y`]-intercept is [_______].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When an equation of a line is written in the form [` y=mx+b `], it is said to be in *slope-intercept form*. In this form, [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the coordinate on the [`y`]-axis where the line intercepts the [`y`]-axis.

In this problem, the line's equation is given as [`` y= -\frac{[$num]x}{[$den]} +[$b] ``]. We can think of the first term as [``-\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}x ``]. This is because:

    [`` \begin{aligned}-\frac{[$num]x}{[$den]} &= -\frac{[$num]}{[$den]} \cdot \frac{x}{1}\\& = -\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}x \end{aligned}``]

Thus the line's slope is [``-\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}``], and its [`y`]-intercept has coordinates [` (0,[$b]) `].
