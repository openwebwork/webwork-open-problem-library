BEGIN_PGML

Assume a tree grows at a constant rate. When the tree was planted, it was [`[$y0]`] feet tall. After [`[$x1]`] years, the tree grew to [`[$y1]`] feet tall.

Use a function to model the tree's height as time passes.
With the context that the tree can live [`[$x2]`] years after planting,
find this function's domain and range.

    The function's domain in this context is [___________]{$domain}.

    The function's range in this context is [___________]{$range}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

##Find the function's equation.

A linear function looks like [`f(x)=mx+b`], where [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the line's [`y`]-intercept. In this context, the value of [`x`] represents the number of years passed since the tree was planted, and the value of [`f(x)`] represents the tree's height in feet.

It's given that the tree was [`[$y0]`] feet tall when it was planted, implying the first point on the line is [`([$x0],[$y0])`].

It's given that the tree was [`[$y1]`] feet tall after [`[$x1]`] years, implying the second point on the line is [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

Now, we can use the slope formula to find the line's slope:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y1]-[$y0]}{[$x1]-[$x0]}\\&=\frac{[$y1-$y0]}{[$x1-$x0]}\\&=[$slope] \end{aligned}``]

This implies the tree grows [`[$slope]`] feet every year.

Now the function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+b`].

It's given that the tree was [`[$y0]`] feet tall when it was planted (or when [`x=0`]). This implies the line's [`y`]-intercept is [`[$y0]`]. So the function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+[$y0]`].

##Determine the function's domain

Without a context, a linear function's domain and range are typically all real numbers (except vertical and horizontal lines). However, in this context, it makes no sense to deal with negative years. We need to limit the domain and range, so the numbers would make sense.

The domain represents the number of years passed since the tree was planted. The [`x`] value starts at [`0`], when the tree was planted. The [`x`] value ends when the tree dies after [`[$x2]`] years. This implies the function's domain is [`[$domain]`].

##Determine the function's range

When the tree was planted, it was [`[$y0]`] feet tall. This is the minimum value in the function's range.

The tree will die after [`[$x2]`] years. To find how tall the tree would be at that year, we substitute the value of [`x`] with [`[$x2]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   f(x) &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \\
   f([$x2])    &=[$slope]\cdot[$x2]+[$y0] \\
   f([$x2])    &=[$slope*$x2]+[$y0] \\
   f([$x2])    &=[$y2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The result implies the tree will reach its maximum height of [`[$y2]`] feet when it dies at the age of [`[$x2]`] years. Thus, the function's range is [`[$range]`].
