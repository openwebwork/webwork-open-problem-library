BEGIN_PGML

[$name] inherited a collection of coins when [$pronoun] was [`[$x0]`] years old. Ever since, [$pronoun] has been adding into the collection the same number of coins each year. When [$pronoun] was [`[$x1]`] years old, there were [`[$y1]`] coins in the collection. When [$pronoun] was [`[$x2]`] years old, there were [`[$y2]`] coins in the collection. At the age of [`[$x3]`], [$name] donated all [$possessive] coins to a museum.

Use a function to model the number of coins in [$name]'s collection, starting in the year [$pronoun] inherited the collection, and ending in the year the collection was donated. Find this function's domain and range in this context.

    The function's domain in this context is [___________]{$domain}.

    The function's range in this context is [___________]{$range}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

##Find the function's equation.

A linear function looks like [`f(x)=mx+b`], where [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the line's [`y`]-intercept. In this context, the value of [`x`] represents the number of years passed since [$name] inherited the collection, and the value of [`f(x)`] represents the number of coins in the collection.

It's given that there were [`[$y1]`] coins when [$name] was [`[$x1]`] years old, implying the first point on the line is [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

It's given that there were [`[$y2]`] coins when [$name] was [`[$x2]`] years old, implying the first point on the line is [`([$x2],[$y2])`].

Now, we can use the slope formula to find the line's slope:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$y1]}{[$x2]-[$x1]}\\&=\frac{[$y2-$y1]}{[$x2-$x1]}\\&=[$slope] \end{aligned}``]

This implies [$name] added [`[$slope]`] coins into the collection every year.

Now the function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+b`].

To find the line's [`y`]-intercept, there are two methods.

###First method to find [`y`]-intercept

We substitute one of the given points into [` f(x)=[$slope]x+b `].  We choose to use [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  f(x) &= [$slope]x + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$slope] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$slope*$x1] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$slope*$x1]} &= [$slope*$x1] + b\mathbf{{}-[$slope*$x1]} \\
  [$b] &= b\\
  b &= [$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

The function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+[$b]`].

###Second method to find [`y`]-intercept

We use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, we choose to use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$slope](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$slope]x+[$slope] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$slope]x-[$slope*$x1] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$slope]x-[$slope*$x1] \mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$slope]x+[$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

The function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+[$b]`].

##Determine the function's domain

Without a context, a linear function's domain and range are typically all real numbers (except vertical and horizontal lines). However, in this context, it makes no sense to deal with negative years. We need to limit the domain and range, so the numbers would make sense.

The domain represents the number of years passed since [$name] inherited the collection. The [`x`] value starts at [`[$x0]`], when [$name] inherited the collection. The [`x`] value ends when [$name] donated the collection when [$pronoun] was [`[$x3]`] years old. This implies the function's domain is [`[$domain]`].

##Determine the function's range

The collection started when [$name] was [`[$x0]`] years old. To find the number of coins in that year, we need to find the value of [`f([$x0])`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   f(x) &=[$slope]x+[$b] \\
   f([$x0])    &=[$slope]\cdot[$x0]+[$b] \\
   f([$x0])    &=[$slope*$x0]+[$b] \\
   f([$x0])    &=[$y0]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

This implies there were [`[$y0]`] coins when [$name] inherited the collection. This is the minimum value in the domain.

[$name] donated the collection when [$pronoun] was [`[$x3]`] years old. To find the number of coins at that year, we need to find the value of [`f([$x3])`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   f(x) &=[$slope]x+[$b] \\
   f([$x3])    &=[$slope]\cdot[$x3]+[$b] \\
   f([$x3])    &=[$slope*$x3]+[$b] \\
   f([$x3])    &=[$y3]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The result implies there were [`[$y3]`] coins when the collection was donated. This is the maximum value in the range. Thus, the function's range is [`[$range]`].
