BEGIN_PGML

An arcade sells multi-day passes. The function [`g(x)=[$func]`] models the number of days a pass will work, where [`x`] is the amount of money paid, in dollars.

Interpret the meaning of [`g([$x1])=[$y1]`].

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

ANS( $radio->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For [`g(x)=[$func]`], the value of [`x`] represents the cost of a pass, and the value of [`g(x)`] represents the number of days the pass will work.

It's helpful to understand those values by units: [`x`] is in "dollars," while [`g(x)`] is in "days."

For [`g([$x1])=[$y1]`], [`[$x1]`] represents [`[$x1]`] dollars, while [`[$y1]`] represents [`[$y1]`] days. The correct solution is [$radio->correct_ans].
