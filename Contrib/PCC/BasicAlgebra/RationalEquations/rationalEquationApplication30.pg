TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name1] and [$name2] worked together to paint a room, and it took them [`[$b]`] hours to complete the job. If they work alone, it would take [$name2] [`[$a]`] more hours than [$name1] to complete the job. Answer the following questions:

If [$name1] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [______]{$ans1} hours to complete the job.

If [$name2] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob2] [______]{$ans2} hours to complete the job.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's understand how to use fractions to model work problems. Assume it takes a person [`5`] hours to complete a job. If we treat the whole job as one whole, each hour, this person would complete [`\frac{1}{5}`] of the job.

Similarly, if it takes a person [`x`] hours to complete a job, each hour, this person would complete [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the job.

Now we are ready to model this situation with math.

Assume that, if [$name1] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [`x`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, [$name1] does [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the whole job.

It's given that, if they work alone, it would take [$name2] [`[$a]`] more hours to complete the job. So it would take [$name2] [`x+[$a]`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, [$name2] does [`\frac{1}{x+[$a]}`] of the whole job.

It's given that, if they work together, it took them [`[$b]`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, they can complete [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] of the whole job.

Now we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x+[$a]} = \frac{1}{[$b]} \\
  &\frac{1}{x} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{1}{x+[$a]} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{1}{[$b]} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$b](x+[$a]) + [$b]x = x(x+[$a]) \\
  &[$b]x+[$a*$b] +[$b]x = x^{2}+[$a]x \\
  &[$b+$b]x+[$a*$b] = x^{2}+[$a]x \\
  & 0= x^{2}+[$a]x -[$b+$b]x -[$a*$b] \\
  & 0= x^{2}+[$a-2*$b]x -[$a*$b] \\
  & 0= (x-[$x1])(x-[$x2]) \\
   &x-[$x1]=0 \:\: or\:\: x-[$x2]=0 \\
   &x=[$x1] \:\: or\:\: x=[$x2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the second step, to get rid of all fractions, we multiplied each term with the common denominator [`[$commonD]`].

In this situation, [`x=[$x2]`] is not a valid solution, since hours cannot be negative. [`x=[$x1]`] is the only solution. It would take [$name1] [`[$ans1]`] hours to complete the job.

Since, if they work alone, it would take [$name2] [`[$a]`] more hours to complete the job, it would take [$name2] [`[$ans1]+[$a]=[$ans2]`] hours to complete the job.
