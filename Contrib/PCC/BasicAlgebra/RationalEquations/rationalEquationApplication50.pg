BEGIN_PGML

Town A and Town B are [`[$b]`] miles apart. With a constant still-water speed, a boat traveled from Town A to Town B, and then back to Town A. During this whole trip, the river flew from Town A to Town B at [`[$a]`] miles per hour. The whole trip took [`[$c]`] hours. Answer the following question:

During this trip, the boat's speed on still water was [______]{$ans} miles per hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume that the boat's still-water speed was [`x`] miles per hour.

Since the river flows from Town A to Town B at [`[$a]`] miles per hour, the boat traveled from Town A  toTown B (along the current) at [`x+[$a]`] miles per hour, and then traveled back from Town B to Town A (against the current) at [`x-[$a]`] miles per hour.

Using the formula [`time=\frac{distance}{speed}`], we know the boat traveled from Town A to Town B in [`\frac{[$b]}{x+[$a]}`] hours; and it traveled back from Town B to Town A in [`\frac{[$b]}{x-[$a]}`] hours.

It's given that the whole trip took [`[$c]`] hours, so we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{[$b]}{x+[$a]}+\frac{[$b]}{x-[$a]} = [$c] \\
  &\frac{[$b]}{x+[$a]} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{[$b]}{x-[$a]} \cdot [$commonD] = [$c] \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$b](x-[$a]) + [$b](x+[$a]) = [$c](x^{2}-[$a*$a]) \\
  &[$b]x-[$a*$b] +[$b]x+[$a*$b] = [$c]x^{2}-[$a*$a*$c] \\
  &[$b+$b]x = [$c]x^{2}-[$a*$a*$c]  \\
  & 0= [$c]x^{2}-[$b+$b]x -[$a*$a*$c]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

When numbers are big, we use the quadratic formula to solve the quadratic equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\
   x &= \frac{-([$b1]) \pm \sqrt{([$b1])^{2}-4 \cdot ([$a1]) \cdot ([$c1])}}{2 \cdot [$a1]} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] \pm \sqrt{[$d1]}}{[$a1+$a1]} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] \pm [$s2]}{[$a1+$a1]} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] + [$s2]}{[$a1+$a1]} \:\: or \:\: x= \frac{[$s1] - [$s2]}{[$a1+$a1]} \\
   x &= [$x1] \:\: or \:\: x= [$x2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In this situation, [`x=[$x2]`] is not a valid solution, since speed cannot be negative. [`x=[$x1]`] is the only solution. 

During this trip, the boat's speed on still water was [`[$ans]`] miles per hour.
