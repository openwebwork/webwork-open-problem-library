BEGIN_PGML

[$name1] and [$name2] are working together to paint a room. If [$name1] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [`[$a]`] hours to complete the job. If [$name2] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob2] [`[$b]`] hours to complete the job. Answer the following question:

If they work together, it would take them [________]{$ans} hours to complete the job. Use a decimal in your answer if needed.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's understand how to use fractions to model work problems. Assume it takes a person [`5`] hours to complete a job. If we treat the whole job as one whole, each hour, this person would complete [`\frac{1}{5}`] of the job.

Similarly, if it takes a person [`x`] hours to complete a job, each hour, this person would complete [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the job.

Now we are ready to model this situation with math.

It's given that, if [$name1] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [`[$a]`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, [$name1] does [`\frac{1}{[$a]}`] of the whole job.

Similarly, if [$name2] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob2] [`[$b]`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, [$name2] does [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] of the whole job.

Assume that, if they work together, it would take them [`x`] hours to complete the job. Thus, each hour, they can complete [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the whole job.

Now we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{[$a]}+\frac{1}{[$b]} = \frac{1}{x} \\
  &\frac{1}{[$a]} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{1}{[$b]} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{1}{x} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$b]x + [$a]x = [$a] \cdot [$b] \\
  &[$a+$b]x = [$a*$b] \\
  & \frac{[$a+$b]x}{[$a+$b]} = \frac{[$a*$b]}{[$a+$b]} \\
  & x=[$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the second step, to get rid of all fractions, we multiplied each term with the common denominator [`[$commonD]`].

By the solution we got, if they work together, it would take them [`[$ans]`] hours to complete the job.
