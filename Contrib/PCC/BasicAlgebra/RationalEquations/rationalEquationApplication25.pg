BEGIN_PGML

Two pipes are being used to fill a tank. Pipe A can fill the tank [`[$a]`] times as fast as Pipe B does. When both pipes are turned on, it takes [`[$b]`] hours to fill the tank. Answer the following questions:

If only Pipe A is turned on, it would take [______]{$ans1} hours to fill the tank.

If only Pipe B is turned on, it would take [______]{$ans2} hours to fill the tank.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's understand how to use fractions to model work problems. Assume it takes a pipe [`5`] hours to fill a tank. If we treat the whole job as one whole, each hour, the pipe would fill [`\frac{1}{5}`] of the tank.

Similarly, if it takes a pipe [`x`] hours to fill a tank, each hour, the pipe would fill [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the tank.

Now we are ready to model this situation with math.

Assume that it would take Pipe A [`x`] hours to fill the tank. Each hour, Pipe A fills [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the tank.

Since Pipe A can fill the tank [`[$a]`] times as fast as Pipe B does, it would take Pipe B [`[$a]x`] hours to fill the tank (Pipe B is slower!). Each hour, Pipe B fills [`\frac{1}{[$a]x}`] of the tank.

It's given that, when both pipes are turned on, it would take them [`[$b]`] hours to fill the tank. Each hour, they can fill [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] of the tank.

Now we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{[$a]x} = \frac{1}{[$b]} \\
  &\frac{1}{x} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{1}{[$a]x} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{1}{[$b]} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$a] \cdot [$b] + [$b] = [$a]x \\
  &[$a*$b]+[$b] = [$a]x \\
  &[$a*$b+$b] = [$a]x \\
  & \frac{[$a*$b+$b]}{[$a]} = \frac{[$a]x}{[$a]} \\
  & [$ans1] = x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the second step, to get rid of all fractions, we multiplied each term with the common denominator [`[$commonD]`].

By the solution we got, it would take Pipe A [`[$ans1]`] hours to fill the tank.

Since Pipe A can fill the tank [`[$a]`] times as fast as Pipe B does, it would take Pipe B [`[$a]\cdot[$ans1]=[$ans2]`] hours to fill the tank.
