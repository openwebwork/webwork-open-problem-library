BEGIN_PGML

If both Pipe A and Pipe B are turned on, it would take [`[$b]`] hours to fill a tank. If each pipe is turned on alone, it takes Pipe B [`[$a]`] fewer hours than Pipe A to fill the tank. Answer the following questions:

If only Pipe A is turned on, it would take [______]{$ans1} hours to fill the tank.

If only Pipe B is turned on, it would take [______]{$ans2} hours to fill the tank.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's understand how to use fractions to model work problems. Assume it takes a pipe [`5`] hours to fill a tank. If we treat the whole job as one whole, each hour, the pipe would fill [`\frac{1}{5}`] of the tank.

Similarly, if it takes a pipe [`x`] hours to fill a tank, each hour, the pipe would fill [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the tank.

Now we are ready to model this situation with math.

Assume that it would take Pipe A [`x`] hours to fill the tank. Each hour, Pipe A fills [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the tank.

Since it takes Pipe B [`[$a]`] fewer hours than Pipe A to fill the tank, it would take Pipe B [`x-[$a]`] hours to fill the tank (Pipe B is faster!). Each hour, Pipe B fills [`\frac{1}{x-[$a]}`] of the tank.

It's given that, if both pipes are turned on, it would take [`[$b]`] hours to fill the tank. Each hour, they can fill [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] of the tank.

Now we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x-[$a]} = \frac{1}{[$b]} \\
  &\frac{1}{x} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{1}{x-[$a]} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{1}{[$b]} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$b](x-[$a]) + [$b]x = x(x-[$a]) \\
  &[$b]x+[$nab] +[$b]x = x^{2}-[$a]x \\
  &[$b+$b]x+[$nab] = x^{2}-[$a]x \\
  & 0= x^{2}-[$a]x -[$b+$b]x -[$nab] \\
  & 0= x^{2}+[$o]x -[$nab] \\
  & 0= (x-[$x1])(x-[$x2]) \\
   &x-[$x1]=0 \:\: or\:\: x-[$x2]=0 \\
   &x=[$x1] \:\: or\:\: x=[$x2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the second step, to get rid of all fractions, we multiplied each term with the common denominator [`[$commonD]`].

Since it takes Pipe B [`[$a]`] fewer hours than Pipe A to fill the tank, it would take Pipe B [`[$ans1]-[$a]=[$ans2]`] hours or [`[$x2]-[$a]=[$x2-$a]`] hours to fill the tank

In this situation, [`[$x2-$a]`] is not a valid solution for Pipe B, since hours cannot be negative. [`x=[$x1]`] is the only solution. Therefore, it takes Pipe A [`[$ans1]`] hours and Pipe B [`[$ans2]`] hours to fill the tank.
