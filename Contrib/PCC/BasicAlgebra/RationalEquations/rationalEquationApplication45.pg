TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A river flows at [`[$c]`] miles per hour. A boat traveled with the current from Town A to Town B, which are [`[$a]`] miles apart. The boat stayed overnight at Town B. The next day, the water's current stopped, and boat traveled on still water to reach Town C, which is [`[$b]`] miles away from Town B. The second leg of the trip (Town B to Town C) took [`[$d]`] hours longer than the first leg (Town A to Town B). During this whole trip, the boat was driving at a constant still-water speed. Find this speed.

Note that you should not consider the unreasonable answer.

During this trip, the boat's speed on still water was [______]{$x1} miles per hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume that the boat's still-water speed was [`x`] miles per hour.

Since the current's speed was [`[$c]`] miles per hour when the boat traveled from Town A  to Town B (with the current), the boat's actual speed was [`x+[$c]`] miles per hour. When the boat traveled from Town B to Town C (on still water), its actual speed was simply [`x`] miles per hour.

Using the formula [`time=\frac{distance}{speed}`], we know the boat traveled from Town A to Town B in [`\frac{[$a]}{x+[$c]}`] hours; and it traveled from Town B to Town C in [`\frac{[$b]}{x}`] hours.

It's given that the second leg of the trip took [`[$d]`] hours longer, so we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{[$a]}{x+[$c]}=\frac{[$b]}{x} - [$d] \\
  &\frac{[$a]}{x+[$c]} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{[$b]}{x} \cdot [$commonD] - [$d] \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$a]x = [$b](x+[$c]) - [$d]x(x+[$c]) \\
  &[$a]x = [$b]x +[$bc] - [$d]x^2 -[$cd]x \\
  &[$d]x^2 +[$a]x -[$b]x +[$cd]x -[$bc] =0 \\
  &[$d]x^2 +[$b1]x +[$c1] =0
\end{aligned}
    ``]

When numbers are big, we use the quadratic formula to solve the quadratic equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\
   x &= \frac{-([$b1]) \pm \sqrt{([$b1])^{2}-4 \cdot ([$a1]) \cdot ([$c1])}}{2 \cdot [$a1]} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] \pm \sqrt{[$d1]}}{[$a12]} \\
   x &\approx \frac{[$s1] \pm [$s2Show]}{[$a12]} \\
   x &\approx \frac{[$s1] + [$s2Show]}{[$a12]} \:\: or \:\: x\approx \frac{[$s1] - [$s2Show]}{[$a12]} \\
   x &\approx [$x1Show] \:\: or \:\: x\approx [$x2Show]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The negative solution, [`[$x2Show]`] does not make sense as a boat speed in context, so we don't consider this solution. The boat's still-water speed was [`[$x1Show]`] miles per hour.
