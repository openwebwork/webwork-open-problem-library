BEGIN_PGML

There are three pipes at a tank. To fill the tank, it would take Pipe A [`[$a]`] hours, Pipe B [`[$b]`] hours, and Pipe C [`[$c]`] hours. Answer the following question:

If all three pipes are turned on, it would take [________]{$ans} hours to fill the tank.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's understand how to use fractions to model work problems. Assume it takes a pipe [`5`] hours to fill a tank. If we treat the whole job as one whole, each hour, the pipe would fill [`\frac{1}{5}`] of the tank.

Similarly, if it takes a pipe [`x`] hours to fill a tank, each hour, the pipe would fill [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the tank.

Now we are ready to model this situation with math.

It's given that it takes Pipe A [`[$a]`] hours to fill the tank. Each hour, Pipe A fills [`\frac{1}{[$a]}`] of the tank.

Similarly, each hour, Pipe B fills [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] of the tank; and Pipe C fills [`\frac{1}{[$c]}`] of the tank.

Assume that, if all pipes are turned on, it would take [`x`] hours to fill the tank. Thus, each hour, they can fill [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the tank.

Now we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{[$a]}+\frac{1}{[$b]} + \frac{1}{[$c]}= \frac{1}{x} \\
  &\frac{1}{[$a]} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{1}{[$b]} \cdot [$commonD] + \frac{1}{[$c]} \cdot [$commonD]= \frac{1}{x} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$f/$a]x + [$f/$b]x +[$f/$c]x = [$f] \\
  &[$o]x = [$f] \\
  & \frac{[$o]x}{[$o]} = \frac{[$f]}{[$o]} \\
  & x=[$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the second step, to get rid of all fractions, we multiplied each term with the common denominator [`[$commonD]`].

By the solution we got, if all pipe are turned on, it would take [`[$ans]`] hours to fill the tank.
