BEGIN_PGML

[$name1] and [$name2] are working together to paint a room. [$name1] works [`[$a]`] times as fast as [$name2] does. If they work together, it took them [`[$b]`] hours to complete the job. Answer the following questions:

If [$name1] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [______]{$ans1} hours to complete the job.

If [$name2] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob2] [______]{$ans2} hours to complete the job.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's understand how to use fractions to model work problems. Assume it takes a person [`5`] hours to complete a job. If we treat the whole job as one whole, each hour, this person would complete [`\frac{1}{5}`] of the job.

Similarly, if it takes a person [`x`] hours to complete a job, each hour, this person would complete [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the job.

Now we are ready to model this situation with math.

Assume that, if [$name1] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [`x`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, [$name1] does [`\frac{1}{x}`] of the whole job.

Since [$name1] works [`[$a]`] times as fast as [$name2] does, if [$name2] paints the room alone, it would take [$ob1] [`[$a]x`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, [$name2] does [`\frac{1}{[$a]x}`] of the whole job.

It's given that, if they work together, it took them [`[$b]`] hours to complete the job. Each hour, they can complete [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] of the whole job.

Now we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{[$a]x} = \frac{1}{[$b]} \\
  &\frac{1}{x} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{1}{[$a]x} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{1}{[$b]} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$a] \cdot [$b] + [$b] = [$a]x \\
  &[$a*$b]+[$b] = [$a]x \\
  &[$a*$b+$b] = [$a]x \\
  & \frac{[$a*$b+$b]}{[$a]} = \frac{[$a]x}{[$a]} \\
  & [$ans1] = x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the second step, to get rid of all fractions, we multiplied each term with the common denominator [`[$commonD]`].

By the solution we got, it would take [$name1] [`[$ans1]`] hours to complete the job.

Since [$name1] works [`[$a]`] times as fast as [$name2] does, it would take [$name2] [`[$a]\cdot[$ans1]=[$ans2]`] hours to complete the job.
