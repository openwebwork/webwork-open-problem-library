TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

Town A and Town B are [`[$b]`] miles apart. With a constant still-water speed of [`[$a]`] miles per hour, a boat traveled from Town A to Town B, and then back to Town A. During this whole trip, the river flew from Town B to Town A at a constant speed. The whole trip took [`[$c]`] hours. Answer the following question:

During this trip, the river's speed was [______]{$ans} miles per hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the river's speed was [`x`] miles per hour. It's give that the boat's still-water speed was [`[$a]`] miles per hour.

Since the river flows from Town B to Town A, the boat traveled from Town A to Town B (against the current) at [`[$a]-x`] miles per hour, and then traveled back from Town B to Town A (along the current) at [`[$a]+x`] miles per hour.

Using the formula [`time=\frac{distance}{speed}`], we know the boat traveled from Town A to Town B in [`\frac{[$b]}{[$a]-x}`] hours; and it traveled back from Town B to Town A in [`\frac{[$b]}{[$a]+x}`] hours.

It's given that the whole trip took [`[$c]`] hours, so we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{[$b]}{[$a]-x}+\frac{[$b]}{[$a]+x} = [$c] \\
  &\frac{[$b]}{[$a]-x} \cdot [$commonD] +\frac{[$b]}{[$a]+x} \cdot [$commonD] = [$c] \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$b]([$a]+x) + [$b]([$a]-x) = [$c]([$a*$a]-x^{2}) \\
  &[$b*$a]+[$b]x +[$b*$a]-[$b]x = [$c*$a*$a]-[$c]x^{2} \\
  &[$s1] = [$c*$a*$a]-[$c]x^{2} \\
  &[$c]x^{2} = [$c*$a*$a]-[$s1] \\
  &[$c]x^{2} = [$c*$a*$a-2*$b*$a] \\
  &x^{2} = \frac{[$c*$a*$a-2*$b*$a]}{[$c]} \\
  &x^{2} = [$rad] \\
  & x=\pm \sqrt{[$rad]} \\
  & x=\pm [$x1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In this situation, [`x=[$x2]`] is not a valid solution, since speed cannot be negative. [`x=[$x1]`] is the only solution. 

During this trip, the river's speed was [`[$ans]`] miles per hour.
