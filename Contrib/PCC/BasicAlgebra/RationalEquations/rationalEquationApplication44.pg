TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A river flows at [`[$c]`] miles per hour. A boat traveled with the current from Town A to Town B, which are [`[$a]`] miles apart. Then, the boat turned around, and traveled against the current to reach Town C, which is [`[$b]`] miles away from Town B. The second leg of the trip (Town B to Town C) took the same time as the first leg (Town A to Town B). During this whole trip, the boat was driving at a constant still-water speed. Answer the following question:

During this trip, the boat's speed on still water was [______]{$ans} miles per hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume that the boat's still-water speed was [`x`] miles per hour.

Since the current's speed was [`[$c]`] miles per hour, the boat traveled from Town A  to Town B (with the current) at [`x+[$c]`] miles per hour, and from Town B to Town C (against the current) at [`x-[$c]`] miles per hour.

Using the formula [`\text{time}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}`], we know the boat traveled from Town A to Town B in [`\frac{[$a]}{x+[$c]}`] hours; and it traveled from Town B to Town C in [`\frac{[$b]}{x-[$c]}`] hours.

It's given that those two legs took the same amount of time, so we can write an equation and solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{[$a]}{x+[$c]}=\frac{[$b]}{x-[$c]}\\
  &\frac{[$a]}{x+[$c]} \cdot [$commonD] = \frac{[$b]}{x-[$c]} \cdot [$commonD] \\
  &[$a](x-[$c]) = [$b](x+[$c]) \\
  &[$a]x-[$a*$c] = [$b]x+[$b*$c]  \\
  &[$a]x-[$b]x = [$b*$c]+[$a*$c] \\
  &[$a-$b]x = [$b*$c+$a*$c] \\
  & \frac{[$a-$b]x}{[$a-$b]} = \frac{[$b*$c+$a*$c]}{[$a-$b]} \\
  & x = [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The boat's still-water speed was [`[$ans]`] miles per hour.
