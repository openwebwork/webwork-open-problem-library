BEGIN_PGML

A mountain is [`[$a]`] feet _above_ sea level.

A trench is [`[$b]`] feet _below_ sea level.

What is the difference in elevation between the mountain top and the bottom of the trench?

$wrong =  NumberWithUnits("$a-$b ft");;
ANS($UnitAns -> cmp() ->
  withPostFilter(AnswerHints(
    $wrong =>
    "Remember that the trench is *below* sea level - does that mean its height has a positive or negative value?")));


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The height of the mountain is simply [`[$a]`] feet because it is _above_ sea level.

The bottom of the trench is [`-[$b]`] feet in height. Note that it is negative because it is _below_ sea level.

To find the difference in height, we use subtraction:

    [`
     \begin{aligned}
             [$a]-(-[$b]) & = [$a]+[$b]\\
                          & = [$ans] 
      \end{aligned}
      `]

The difference in elevation from the mountain top to the bottom of the trench is [`[$UnitAns]`].
