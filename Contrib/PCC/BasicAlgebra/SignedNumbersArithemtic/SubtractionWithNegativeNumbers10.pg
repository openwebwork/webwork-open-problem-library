BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It helps to understand that the subtraction sign means that we are adding the opposite. For example, [`3-2=3+(-2)`]. For many students, it's easier to change "minus a number" into "adding the opposite number". This way of looking at subtraction will help us understand more complicated topics later, like subtracting a negative number.

######METHOD 1  
One way is to use a number line. Let's do this for [`[$a]-[$b]`]. First, we rewrite it as 

    [`[$a]+([$negB])`]

Find [`[$a]`] on a number line. Since we are adding a negative number, we move left, in the negative direction, by [`[$b]`] units. We will reach [`[$ans1]`] on the number line, which is the answer.

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr), width=>400, height=>50, tex_size=>800, 
   extra_html_tags=>'alt="Graph of a number line with a dot at '.
   "$a".
   ' and an arrow pointing leftward to '.
   "$ans1".'.",
   title="A number line showing subtraction of whole numbers'.
   '."'  )@]*  <<



So [`[$a]-[$b]=[$ans1]`].

Similarly, [`[$c]-[$d]=[$ans2]`] and [`[$e]-[$f]=[$ans3]`].

######METHOD 2

A second method asks you to think in context; for example when money is involved or the temperature changes. Let's do this for [`[$a]-[$b]`]. First, we rewrite it as 

   [`[$a]+([$negB])`].

The first number is [`[$a]`]. Since it's positive, it's like you won [`[$a]`] dollars at the casino this morning.

The second number is [`[$negB]`]. Since it's negative, it's like you lost [`[$b]`] dollars in the casino later this afternoon.

Since you lost more money than you won, you ended up losing money overall, implying the answer is negative.

Since you won [`[$a]`] dollars and then lost [`[$b]`] dollars, it makes sense that you lost the difference of [`[$b]`] and [`[$a]`] dollars, which is [`[$absAns1]`] dollars. So the final answer is: [`[$a]-[$b]=[$ans1]`].
