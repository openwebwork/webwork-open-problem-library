BEGIN_PGML

Simplify the following expressions. Don't forget to write the domain conditions lost during the simplification, if any. For example, when we do the simplification [`\frac{x^2}{x} =x`], we must write [`x \ne 0`]. If you need to enter more than one number, use commas to separate them.

1) [``[$question1]=``] [___________________]{$ans1} The domain condition(s) lost during the simplification is (are) [`[$var] \ne`][_____]{$lostDomain1}.

2) [``[$question2]=``] [___________________]{$ans2} The domain condition(s) lost during the simplification is (are) [`[$var] \ne`][_____]{$lostDomain2}.

3) [``[$question3]=``] [___________________]{$ans3} The domain condition(s) lost during the simplification is (are) [`[$var] \ne`][_____]{$lostDomain3}.

4) [``[$question4]=``] [___________________]{$ans4} The domain condition(s) lost during the simplification is (are) [`[$var] \ne`][_____]{$lostDomain4}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[`[$var]+[$a]`] and [`[$a]+[$var]`] are equivalent, because [`4+2`] and [`2+4`] produce the same answer.

However, [`[$var]-[$a]`] and [`[$a]-[$var]`] are NOT equivalent, because [`4-2`] and [`2-4`] produce different answers. Here is a frequently-used formula:

    [`` x-y = -(y-x) ``]

Here is a quick proof:

    [`` -(y-x)=-1(y-x)=-1y+(-1)(-x)=-y+x=x-y ``]

Using this formula, we have:

    [`` [$a] - [$var] = -([$var]-[$a]) ``]

----

Here are answers to those problems:

1)
    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$question1] &= [$ans1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Since the term [`[$var]+[$a]`] was crossed out, the domain condition lost during the simplification is [`[$lostDomain1]`].

----

2)
    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$question2] &= \frac{[$num2]}{[$num2]} \\
                       &= [$ans2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Since the term [`[$var]+[$a]`] was crossed out, the domain condition lost during the simplification is [`[$lostDomain2]`].

----

3)
    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$question3] &= [$ans3]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Since the term [`[$var]-[$a]`] was crossed out, the domain condition lost during the simplification is [`[$lostDomain3]`].

----

4)
    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$question4] &= \frac{[$num4]}{-([$var]-[$a])} \\
                       &= \frac{1}{-1} \\
                       &= [$ans4]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Since the term [`[$a]-[$var]`] was crossed out, the domain condition lost during the simplification is [`[$lostDomain4]`].
