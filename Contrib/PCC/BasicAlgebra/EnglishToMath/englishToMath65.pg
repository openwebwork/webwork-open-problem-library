TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

Translate the following phrase or sentence into a math expression or equation (whichever is appropriate). Use [`[$var]`] to represent the unknown number.

    [@numberWord($a)@] less than [$word] a number

    [_______]{$ans} 

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The phrase "[$word]" implies multiplication. So we have 

    [@numberWord($a)@] less than [`[$b][$var]`]

The phrase "less than" implies subtraction, and that [`[$a]`] is being _subtracted from_ [`[$b][$var]`].  So the answer is [` [$ans] `].

Note that a common mistake is to write: [`[$mistake]`]. To help you understand why this is incorrect, look at the following example.

Assume Tom has [`10`] marbles. If Jerry has [`2`] less (or fewer) than Tom, then Jerry has [`8`] marbles. Notice that we translated "[`2`] less than [`10`]" into [`10-2`].

Similarly, we should translate "[`[$a]`] less than [`[$b][$var]`]" into [`[$ans]`].
