BEGIN_PGML

In a certain store, cashiers can serve [`[$a]`] customers per hour on average. If [`x`] customers arrive at the store in a given hour, then the average number of customers [`C`] waiting in line can be modeled by the function

    [`` C(x) = [$func] ``]

where [`x<[$a]`].

Answer the following questions with a graphing calculator. Round your answers to integers.

1) If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [__________]{$y1r} customers waiting in line.

2) If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [__________]{$x2} customers arrived in the past hour.

$s1 = $a*$x1+$b;
$s2 = $c*$x1+$d;
$s3 = $y3*$c-$a; 
$s4 = $b-$y3*$d;
$s5 = $a*10000+$b;
$s6 = $c*10000+$d;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

1) If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, approximately how many customers are waiting in line.

To answer this question, we substitute [`x`] with [`[$x1]`], and we have:

    [`` C([$x1]) = \frac{[$x1]^{2}}{[$a2]-[$a]([$x1])} \approx [$y1] \approx [$y1r] ``]

If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [`[$y1r]`] customers waiting in line.

2) If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately how many customers arrived in the past hour?

To answer this question, we substitute [`C`] with [`[$y2r]`], and we have:

    [`` [$y2r]= [$func] ``]

We will use a graphing calculator's *solve()* function to solve this equation.

For TI-89, press Home, F2, choose *solve(*, press Enter. Then, type in the equation:

    solve([`[$y2r]`]=[`x`]^2/([$a2]-[$a]x),x)

For Casio ClassPad 300, tap Main, Action in the menu, Advanced, solve, and then type in the same equation above.

Ignore the unreasonable solution, and round the reasonable solution to [`[$x2]`].

If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [`[$x2]`] customers arrived in the past hour.
