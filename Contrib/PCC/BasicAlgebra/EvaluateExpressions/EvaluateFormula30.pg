#Create some random integers.

In your answers to this problem, use *m* for meters, and *s* for seconds.

The formula  

    [``y=\frac{1}{2}\,a\,t^2 +v_0\,t + y_0``]  

gives the vertical position of an object, at time [`t`], thrown with an initial velocity [`v_0`], from an initial position [`y_0`] in a place where the acceleration of gravity is [`a`]. 

What is the height of a baseball thrown with an initial velocity of [`v_0=[$v0U]`], from an initial position of [`y_0= [$y0U]`], and at time [`t=[$tU]`]? 

Note that the acceleration of gravity on earth is [`[$gU]`]. It is negative, because we consider the upward direction as positive in this situation, while the gravity pulls the object down.

    After [`[$tU]`], the baseball was [__________]{$heightU} high in the air.

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

These given values can be substituted into the formula as follows:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   y &= \frac{1}{2}\,a\,t^2 +v_0\,t + s_0 \\
     &= \frac{1}{2}\left([$gU]\right)([$tU])^{2} + \left([$v0U]\right)([$tU]) +[$y0U] \\
     &= [$heightU]
\end{aligned}
``]

The baseball was [`[$heightU]`] high in the air.
