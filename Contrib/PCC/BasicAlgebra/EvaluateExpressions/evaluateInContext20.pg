TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

The percentage of births in the U.S. delivered via C-section can be given by the following formula for the years since 1996: [```p = 0.8(y-1996)+21```] In this formula [`y`] is a year after 1996 and [`p`] is the percentage of births delivered via C-section for that year. 

What percentage of births in the U.S. were delivered via C-section in the year [$n]?

    [______________]{$ans} of births in the U.S. were delivered via C-section in the year [$n].

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since we are working with the year [$n], we have that [`y=[$n]`]. We can substitute this into the formula:

    [`\begin{aligned}
       p &= 0.8(y-1996)+21\\
            &= 0.8([$n]-1996)+21\\
            &= 0.8([$n-1996])+21\\
            &= [$rans-21]+21\\
            &= [$rans]
     \end{aligned}`]

So in [$n], [`[$rans]`]% of births in the U.S were delivered via C-section.
