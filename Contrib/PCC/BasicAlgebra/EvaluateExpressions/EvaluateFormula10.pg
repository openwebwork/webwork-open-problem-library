The formula  

    [``A=\frac{1}{2}\,r\,n\,s``]  

gives the area of a regular polygon with side length [`s`], number of sides [`n`] and, apothem [`r`]. (The _apothem_ is the distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.)

What is the area of a regular pentagon with [`s= [$s]`] and [`r=[$r]`]?
[%This is how to comment in PGML. Every variable that you reference needs to be encased in brackets, hence [$a]. Then, to use math mode we encase in [` `].%]

    The area is [___________]{$answer} . (Use *in* for inches and *in^2* for square inches.)

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
A pentagon will have five sides, which means that [`n=5`].  The values can be substituted into the formula as follows:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A &= \frac{1}{2}\,r\,n \,s \\
     &= \frac{1}{2}([$r])(5)([$s]) \\
     &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
``]

The pentagon's area is [`[$answer]`].
