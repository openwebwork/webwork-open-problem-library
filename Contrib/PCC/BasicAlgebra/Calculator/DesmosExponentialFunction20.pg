TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A cup of coffee's temperature was [`[$initial]`] degrees (Fahrenheit) when it was poured into a cup. The coffee's temperature, in Fahrenheit degrees, can be modeled by the following function:

    [`` f(t)=[$func] ``]
    
where [`t`] is the number of minutes passed since the coffee was poured into the cup.

Use graphing technology to solve the following problems.

1) After [`[$x1]`] minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [___________]{$y1R} degrees. Round your answer to three decimal places.

2) After [___________]{$x2R} minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$y2]`] degrees. Round your answer to three decimal places.

3) In the long run, the coffee's temperature would be [___________]{$room} degrees.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$funcX] `]. Note that you should replace the variable [`t`] with [`x`].

###Question 1

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$x1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$x1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$y1Show]`].

After [`[$x1]`] minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$y1R]`] degrees.

###Question 2

We need to create a second function [`y=[$y2]`], and then let desmos find the intersection between those two functions.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$y2]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2]`]. Desmos shows [`([$x2Show],[$y2])`].

After [`[$x2R]`] minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$y2]`] degrees.

###Part 3: 

To find what value the function is approaching as [`x`] becomes bigger and bigger, we can substitute the [`x`] value with a very big number.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f(1000000) `]. Desmos shows a value very close to [`[$room]`]. Actually, the bigger the [`x`] value, the closer the function's value is to [`[$room]`].

In the long run, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$room]`] degrees (the room temperature).
