BEGIN_PGML

Currently, an artist can sell [`[$initialAmount]`] paintings every year at the price of [`[$initialPriceC]`] per painting. Each time he raises the price per painting by [`[$raiseC]`], he sells [`[$numLoss]`] fewer paintings every year.

Assume the artist will raise the price per painting [`x`] times.

The current price per painting is [`[$initialPriceC]`]. After raising the price [`x`] times, each time by [`[$raiseC]`], the new price per painting will become [`[$initialPrice]+[$raise]x`] dollars.

Currently he sells [`[$initialAmount]`] paintings per year. It's given that he will sell [`[$numLoss]`] fewer paintings each time he raises the price. After raising the price per painting [`x`] times, he will sell [`[$initialAmount]-[$numLoss]x`] paintings every year.

The artist's income can be calculated by multiplying the number of paintings sold with price per painting. If he raises the price per painting [`x`] times, his new yearly income can be modeled by the function:

    [`` f(x)=([$initialPrice]+[$raise]x)([$initialAmount]-[$numLoss]x) ``]

where [`f(x)`] stands for his yearly income in dollars.

With graphing technology, answer the following questions:

1) To obtain maximum income of [__________]{$maxIncomeC}, the artist should set the price per painting at [___________]{$maxPriceC}.

2) To earn [`[$newIncomeC]`] per year, the artist could sell his paintings at two different prices. The lower price is [___________]{$ans1C} per painting, and the higher price is [___________]{$ans2C} per painting.

$s1 = $initialPrice*$numLoss;
$s2 = $raise*$initialAmount;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will change the function to its standard form:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   f(x) &= ([$initialPrice]+[$raise]x)([$initialAmount]-[$numLoss]x) \\
        &= [$cFunc]-[$s1]x+[$s2]x+[$a]x^2 \\
        &= [$a]x^2+[$b]x+[$cFunc]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

We can see [`f(x)`]'s graph is an upside-down parabola.

We will use desmos.com to answer the questions.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `].

###Question 1

The maximum income he can make is represented by the parabola's vertex.

Step 3: Zoom out on the window until you can see the parabola's vertex. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis. Only use the following recommended settings if you are stuck: xmin=[`[$left]`], xmax=[`[$right]`], ymin=[`[$bottom]`], ymax=[`[$top]`].

Step 4: Click on the vertex, and desmos shows [`[$vertex]`].

The function's vertex is at [`[$vertex]`]. This implies the artist can earn a maximum yearly income of [`[$maxIncomeC]`]. This happens if he increases the price per painting [`[$maxX]`] times, making the new price [`[$initialPrice]+[$maxX]\cdot[$raise]=[$maxPrice] `] dollars.

###Question 2

If the artist wants to make [`[$newIncomeC]`] per year, we need to set the function's value to be [`[$newIncome]`]. At desmos.com, we will create a second function [`y=[$newIncome]`], and then let desmos find the intersections between those two functions.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$newIncome]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersections of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$newIncome]`].

Step 5: Click on the intersections of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$newIncome]`]. Desmos shows [`([$x1],[$newIncome])`] and [`([$x2],[$newIncome])`].

If the artist raises the price [`[$x1]`] times, the new price would be [`[$initialPrice]+[$raise]\cdot[$x1]=[$ans1]`] dollars per painting.

If the artist raises the price [`[$x2]`] times, the new price would be [`[$initialPrice]+[$raise]\cdot[$x2]=[$ans2]`] dollars per painting.

To earn [`[$newIncomeC]`] per year, the artist could sell his paintings at two different prices. The lower price is [`[$ans1C]`] per painting, and the higher price is [`[$ans2C]`] dollars per painting.
