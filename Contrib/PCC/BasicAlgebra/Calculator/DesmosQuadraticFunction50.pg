BEGIN_PGML

You will build a rectangular sheep pen next to a river. There is no need to build a fence along the river, so you only need to build three sides. You have a total of [`[$fence]`] feet of fence to use. Find the dimensions of the pen such that you can enclose the maximum area.

Let the width be [`w`] ft, and the length be [`l`] ft. Since there are only three sides of the fence, we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   l+2w &= [$fence] \\
   l    &= [$fence]-2w
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If the pen's width is [`w`] feet, then its length is [`[$fence]-2w`] feet. Now we can build a function for the area of the pen:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(w) &= ([$fence]-2w)w \\
   A(w) &= -2w^2+[$fence] w
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In this formula, [`w`] represents the pen's width in feet, and [`A(w)`] represents the pen's area in square feet.

>>[@ image(insertGraph( $picture  ), tex_size=>400, height=>400, width=>400,extra_html_tags=>"alt = '$penAlt' title = '$penAlt' ") @]*<<

With graphing technology, answer the following questions:

1. To maximize the area of the pen, the length of the pen (parallel to the river) should be [____________]{$lengthU}.

2. To maximize the area of the pen, the width of the pen (away from the river) should be [____________]{$widthU}.

3. The maximum area of the pen is [____________]{$areaU}.

(Use *ft* for feet, and *ft^2* for square feet.)

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The function [`A(w)=[$func]`] models the pen's area. By its formula, we can tell its graph is an upside-down parabola. The parabola's vertex represents the pen's maximum area.

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$funcX] `]. Note that we need to replace [`w`] with [`x`] and replace [`A(w)`] with [`f(x)`].

Step 3: Zoom out on the window until you can see the parabola's vertex. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis. Only use the following recommended settings if you are stuck: xmin=[`[$left]`], xmax=[`[$right]`], ymin=[`[$bottom]`], ymax=[`[$top]`].

Step 4: Click on the vertex, and desmos shows [`[$vertex]`].

The vertex implies the pen has a maximum area of [`[$areaU]`] when its width is [`[$widthU]`].

To calculate the pen's length when width is [`[$width]`], we substitute [`w=[$width]`] into [`l=[$fence]-2w`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   l &= [$fence]-2w \\
   l &= [$fence]-2([$width]) \\
   l &= [$length]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

To summarize, the pen has a maximum of [`[$areaU]`] when its length is [`[$lengthU]`] and its width is [`[$widthU]`].
