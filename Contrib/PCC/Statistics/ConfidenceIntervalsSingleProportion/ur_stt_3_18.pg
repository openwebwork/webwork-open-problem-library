BEGIN_TEXT

College officials want to estimate the percentage of students who carry a gun, knife, or
other such weapon. How many randomly selected students must be surveyed in order to be 
\( $perc$PERCENT\)  confident that the sample percentage has a margin of error of 
\( $e \) percentage points? $PAR

(a) \( \ \) Assume that there is no available information that could be used as an estimate 
of \( \hat{p} \). $PAR

\(n=\) \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PAR

(b) \( \ \) Assume that another study indicated that \( $a$PERCENT\)  of college 
students carry weapons.$PAR

\(n=\) \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  Assuming no prior information is known about \(\hat{p}\), we should assume the "worst case" scenario with \(\hat{p}=0.5\) and thus \(\hat{q}=0.5\).  Since we wish to have margin of error \($e\) percentage points, or \($edec\) as a decimal, and \( $perc$PERCENT\) confidence, which corresponds to \(z^{*}\approx$z\), we can find the needed sample size using the formula, \(\text{MOE} = z^{*}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}\).  
$PAR
Using this we obtain,
$PAR
\($edec = $z\sqrt{\frac{(0.5)(0.5)}{n}}\).  Solving for \(n\), we find \(n=$ans1\).
$PAR 
(b)  Assuming our margin of error and confidence level have not changed, we now also know that another study indicated that \($a$PERCENT\) of college students carry weapons, meaning \(\hat{p}=$p\) and therefore \(\hat{q}=$q\).  Thus we can use the margin of error formula again to obtain,
$PAR
\($edec = $z\sqrt{\frac{($p)($q)}{n}}\).  Solving for \(n\), we find \(n=$ans2\).
