BEGIN_SOLUTION

Option \(D\).  Consider a sample of size \(n=100\), with \(\hat{p}=0.5\) and \(\hat{q}=0.5\) and \(z^{*} =$z\), for \(90$PERCENT\) confidence.  This gives us,
$PAR
\(\text{MOE}= $z\sqrt{\frac{(0.5)(0.5)}{100}} \approx 0.082\) or \(8.2$PERCENT\).
$PAR
If we raise our confidence level to \(95$PERCENT\), or, \(z^{*}=$z95\), we find,
$PAR
\(\text{MOE}= $z95\sqrt{\frac{(0.5)(0.5)}{100}} \approx 0.098\) or, \(9.8$PERCENT\).  
$PAR
Increasing the confidence level increases the margin of error, therefore options \(A\) and \(B\) are not true.  Also, since are a larger confidence level has a larger margin of error, we also have a larger interval which \(p\) could be in.  This means we have less precision.
