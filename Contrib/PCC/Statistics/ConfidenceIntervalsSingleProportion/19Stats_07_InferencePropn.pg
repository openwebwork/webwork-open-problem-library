#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
$name[$person] wants to determine a \($C\) confidence interval 
for the true proportion of high school students in the area who attend 
their home basketball games. How large of a sample must $pronoun have 
to get a margin of error less than \($m\)?  

$PAR
\(n ={}\)  \{ ans_rule(15)\}

  $ans-1 => ["You must round up to make sure the margin of error is no more than 0.05."]
)));

BEGIN_SOLUTION

If $name[$person] wants an \($C\) confidence level, this will correspond to \(z^{*}=$zr\).  We also know $pronoun wants a margin of error of less than \($m\).  This means we can fill in the formula \(\text{MOE} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}\cdot z^{*}\) to obtain \($m = \sqrt{\frac{0.5\cdot 0.5}{n}}\cdot $zr\).  Recall that when we do not know \(\hat{p}\) or \(\hat{q}\) we use the "worst case scenario" with \(\hat{p}=0.5\) and \(\hat{q}=0.5\).  The previous equation is solved and and we find \(n=$nactual\).  Note that our answer must be a whole number since it is sample size and that \(n=$nactual\) would give us a margin of error of exactly \($m\).  But as we want the Margin of Error less than \($m\) we need to round up to \(n=$n\).
