BEGIN_SOLUTION
Note that both answers should be in $DOLLAR\(\)'s, rounded to the nearest penny.
$PAR
(a) The given probability model does not include the chances that you win nothing.  To find this we will need to subtract all chances in our probability model from 1.
$PAR
Therefore, \(\text{P}(\text{nothing})= 1 - \frac{1}{$c1,000,000} - \frac{1}{$c2,000,000} -\frac{1}{$c3,000,000} -\frac{1}{$c4,000,000} -\frac{1}{$c5,000} -\frac{1}{$c6,000} = $missingp\)
$PAR
From here, we can complete our probability model.

\{row( "$DOLLAR$p6 ", "\(\frac{1}{$c6,000}\)" ) \}
\{row( "$DOLLAR 0 ", "$missingp" ) \}
\{endtable()\}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Using technology, we find the expected value to be \(\text{E}(X)=\mu=$ans1\)
$PAR
(b) Since each stamp is \($costC\) cents, we would have to subtract this from our expected value since we would have to pay it each time.  Thus the new expected value is \($ans1-$costC=$ans2\)
