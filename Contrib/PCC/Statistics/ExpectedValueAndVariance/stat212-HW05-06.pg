$PAR 
When parking a car in a downtown parking lot, drivers 
pay according to the number of hours or fraction thereof.  
The probability distribution of the number of hours cars 
are parked has been estimated as follows:

$PAR
$BCENTER
\{begintable(9)\}
\{row("\(X\)", "\(1\)", "\(2\)", "\(3\)", "\(4\)", "\(5\)", "\(6\)", "\(7\)", "\(8\)")\}
\{row("\(P(X)\)", "\($a1\)", "\($a2\)", "\($a3\)", "\($a4\)", "\($a5\)", "\($a6\)", "\($a7\)", "\($a8\)")\}
\{endtable()\}
$ECENTER
$PAR
A.  Mean = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  Standard Deviation = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
The cost of parking is \($c7\) dollars per hour.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the amount of revenue each car generates.
$PAR
A.  Mean = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  Standard Deviation = \{ans_rule(15)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
For a larger model like this, it makes more sense to do find the values in questions with technology.  Both a calculator or MS Excel will suffice to find that,
$PAR
(a) \(\mu = $c4\)
$PAR
Still by hand, it can be found, \(\mu = (1*$a1)+(2*$a2)+(3*$a3)+(4*$a4)+(5*$a5)+(6*$a6)+(7*$a7)+(8*$a8)= $c4\)
$PAR
(b)  Using technology we will find the standard deviation to be,  \(\sigma_{x} \approx $c6\)
$PAR
(c)  Note:  Answers to parts (c) and (d) should be  in $DOLLAR\(\)'s, rounded to the nearest penny.  As the cost of parking is \($c7\) dollars per hour, we could now think of our model \(X\) above, as \($c7 X\).  This means to find the average cost we have, \(\text{E}($c7 X)=$c7 \cdot \text{E}(X) = $c7 \cdot $c4 = $new\)
$PAR
(d)  For standard deviation, we also find it is increased by a multiple of \($c7\).  Therefore our new standard deviation is \(\sigma_{x} = $c7 \cdot $c6 = $new2\)
