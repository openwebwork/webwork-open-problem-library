multiple-choice test often used by psychologists.  A news report 
(The New York Times, Feb. 15, 1988) stated that the researchers found 
statistically significant personality differences between the runners 
and the 30-year-old male population as a whole.  A headline on the article

They had twenty-two people work through a pencil and paper maze six times, three times while wearing a floral-scented mask and three times while wearing an unscented mask. The three trials for each mask closely followed one another. Testers measured the length of time it took the subjects to complete each of the six trials. They reported that, on average, the subjects wearing the floral-scented mask completed the maze more quickly than those wearing the unscented mask, though the difference was not statistically significant.
