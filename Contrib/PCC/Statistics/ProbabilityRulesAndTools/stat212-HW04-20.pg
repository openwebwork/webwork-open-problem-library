$PAR 
The owner of an appliance store is interested in the relationship between the price at which an  item is sold (regular or sale price) and the customer's decision on whether to purchase and extended warranty.  After analyzing her records, she produced the following joint probabilities:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
                     & \mbox{Purchased} & \mbox{Did not purchase} \\ 
                     & \mbox{extended warranty} & \mbox{extended warranty} \\ \hline
\mbox{Regular Price} & $a1 & $a3 \\ \hline
\mbox{Sale Price} & $a2 & $a4 \\ 
\end{array}
\]


$PAR
A. What is the probability that a customer who bought an item at the regular price purchased the extended warranty? 
\{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. What is the probability that a customer buys an extended warranty? 
\{ans_rule(15)\}
