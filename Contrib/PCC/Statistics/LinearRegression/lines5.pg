BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
For the equation \(y = $b_1 x - $b_0\), 
$PAR
a. The \(y\)-intercept is \{ans_rule(20)\}, and the slope is \{ans_rule(20)\}.
$PAR
b. 
\{ $mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
$PAR
c. Use two points to graph the equation on paper. This is only for your own sake and cannot currently be assessed through WeBWorK.
