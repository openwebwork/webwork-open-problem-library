BEGIN_SOLUTION

An accounting professor claims that no more than one quarter, which is \(25$PERCENT\), of undergraduate business students will major in accounting.  This means we can use \(p=0.25\) and \(q=0.75\).  As we have a large sample size, it would make sense to use the normal approximation of the binomial model if our "pass / fail" condition holds.  Since \($n\cdot 0.25 >10\) and \($n\cdot 0.75 >10\) we can use our normal model approximation.
$PAR
We have mean \(\mu=np\) and \(\sigma = \sqrt{npq}\).  Thus, \(\mu=$mu\) and \(\sigma = $sigma\).
$PAR
We wish to find the probability of more than \($c\) students majoring in accounting.  This allows us to \(z=\frac{$c-$mu}{$sigma} = $z2\).
$PAR
Using our normal curve, seen below, with \(z>$z2\).
$PAR
\{Plot($diagram, tex_size=>900)\}
$PAR
We find that the probability is \($ans3\)
