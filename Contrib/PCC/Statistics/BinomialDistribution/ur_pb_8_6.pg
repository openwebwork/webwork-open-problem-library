BEGIN_TEXT
The Census Bureau reports that \(82$PERCENT\) of Americans over the age of \(25\) are high school graduates.
A survey of randomly selected residents of certain county included \($n\) who were over the age of \(25\), 
and \($s\) of them were high school graduates. $BR

(a) Find the mean and standard deviation for the total number of high school graduates in random groups of \($n\) Americans who are over the age of \(25\). $BR

Mean = \{ans_rule(15)\} $BR

Standard deviation = \{ans_rule(15)\} $BR

(b) Is that county result of \($s\) unusually high, or low, or neither? \{$popup->menu\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

For the binomial model we have mean \(\mu=np\) and standard deviation \(\sigma = \sqrt{npq}\).  Thus, 
$PAR
(a) \(\mu=$mean\)
$PAR
(b) \(\sigma = $dev\)
$PAR
(c) To decide if the county result of \($s\) is unusually high, low, or neither, we need to find a \(z\)-score.  This assumes we should be able to use a normal model.  Thus \(z=\frac{$s-$mean}{$dev}=$z\)
$PAR
Generally we think of any \(z<-3\) to be unusually low and \(z>3\) to be unusually high.  In this case the result is "$ans."
