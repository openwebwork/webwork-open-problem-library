$PAR
A psychologist believes that \($a$PERCENT\) of male drivers 
when lost continue to drive, hoping to find the location 
they seek rather than ask directions.  To examine this 
belief, he took a random sample of \($b\) male drivers and 
asked each what they did when lost.  If the belief is 
true, determine the probability that less than \($c$PERCENT\) 
said they continue driving.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

The normal model is likely not appropriate here as the sample is only \($b\).  Since we want to determine the probability that less than \($c$PERCENT\) continue to drive, this is the same as less than \($c1 \cdot $b=$d\) people continue to drive.  As we are interested in the situation "less than," we will not include \($d\) in our calculation.
$PAR
In effect, this means we need to compute \(\text{P}(X\leq $lessthan) = \text{P}(X=0)+\text{P}(X=1)+...+...+\text{P}(X=$lessthan)=$exactreal\)
