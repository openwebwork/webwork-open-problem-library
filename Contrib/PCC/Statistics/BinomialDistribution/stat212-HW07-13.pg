BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
The proportion of eligible voters in the next election who 
will vote for the incumbent is assumed to be \($a$PERCENT\).  
What is the probability that in a random sample of \($b\) voters, 
less that \($c$PERCENT\) say they will vote for the incumbent?

BEGIN_SOLUTION

As we have large sample size, it would make sense to use the normal approximation of the binomial model if our "pass / fail" condition hold.  Since \($b\cdot$sucdec >10\) and \($b\cdot$faildec >10\) we can can use our normal model approximation.
$PAR
With our normal model we have mean \(\mu=np\) and \(\sigma = \sqrt{npq}\).  Thus, \(\mu=$mu\) and \(\sigma = $sigma\).
$PAR
The probability that less than \($c$PERCENT\) of people will vote for the incumbent, in a sample of \($b\), is the same saying less than \($c1\) people will vote for the incumbent.  This allows us to find \(z=\frac{$c1-$mu}{$sigma} = $z\).
$PAR
Using our normal curve, seen below, with \(z<$z\).
$PAR
\{Plot($diagram, tex_size=>900)\}
$PAR
We find that the probability is \($ans1\)
