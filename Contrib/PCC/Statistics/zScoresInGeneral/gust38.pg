a)  The area under the standard Normal curve that lies to the left of \(z=$z1\) is \($area1string\).  Without consulting a the table giving areas under the standard Normal curve, determine the area under the standard Normal curve that lies to the right of \(z=$opp\). $BR  answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) Since the normal curve is symmetrical about the mean of \(0\), the area found to the left of any \(z\)-score, for example \(z=-1\), will be the same as the area found to the right of the \(z\)-score of opposite sign, in this case \(z=1\).  Since the area to the left of \(z=$z1\) is \($area1string\), by symmetry, the area to the right of \(z=$opp\) is \($area1string\)
$PAR
(b)  Option \(D\).  We answered the above question using symmetry about the mean of \(0\).
