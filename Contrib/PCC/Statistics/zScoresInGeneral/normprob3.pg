BEGIN_TEXT
Consider a Normal distribution curve where \($p2\)-th percentile is at \($x2\) and the \($p1\)-th percentile is at \($x1\). 
Use this information to find the mean,  \(\mu\) , and the standard deviation, \(\sigma \), of the distribution. This is basically an algebra problem where you have two equations in two unknowns, and you must solve for the two unknowns.
$PAR
a) $SPACE\(\mu =\) \{ans_rule(20)\}$BR$BR
b) $SPACE\(\sigma =\) \{ans_rule(20)\}$BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

First we will find the \(z\)-scores that correspond to the \($p2\)-th and \($p1\)-th percentile.  Using inverse technology with area \($prop2\) and \($prop1\) we find \(z=$z2\) and \(z=$z1\) respectively. 
$PAR
This allows us to build two equations involving \(z\)-scores,
$PAR
\($z2=\frac{$x2-\mu}{\sigma}\) and \($z1=\frac{$x1-\mu}{\sigma}\)
$PAR
Solving each for \(\mu\), we find, 
$PAR
\(\mu = $x2-(\sigma\cdot$z2)\) and \(\mu = $x1-(\sigma\cdot$z1)\) respectively.
$PAR
Setting the two equations equal to each other we have, 
$PAR
\($x2-(\sigma\cdot$z2)=$x1-(\sigma\cdot$z1)\)
$PAR
This can solved to find \(\sigma = $sig\).
$PAR
The value \(\sigma=$sig\) can then be used in the either equation of \($z2=\frac{$x2-\mu}{\sigma}\) or \($z2=\frac{$x2-\mu}{\sigma}\) to find \(\mu\).  Either equation can be solved to find \(\mu=$mu\)
