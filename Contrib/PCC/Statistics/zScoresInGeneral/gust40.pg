BEGIN_SOLUTION

The total area of the standard Normal curve is always \(1\).  As the curve stretches infinitely in both directions, for any positive \(z\)-score you find, there is always a larger one.  As such, you will never find a \(z\)-score that corresponds to an area of \(1\), it will always be under \(1\).  
$PAR
Similarly, for any negative \(z\)-score you find, there is always a larger one.  As such, you will never find a \(z\)-score that corresponds to an area of \(0\), it will always be greater than \(0\).
$PAR
The area under the standard Normal curve that lies to the left of a \(z\)-score is always strictly larger than \(0\) and strictly smaller than \(1\).
