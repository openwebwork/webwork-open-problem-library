BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) Option \(C\).  When not standardized, values for mean and standard deviation can always vary.  However, when working with a Normal distribution, all standardized variables have a mean of \(0\) and a standard deviation of \(1\).

$PAR

(b)  Option \(A\).  The definition of a \(z\)-score is the number of standard deviations that the observation is from the mean.

$PAR 

(c) Option \(A\).  When working with Normal distributions and \(z\)-scores, any observation above the mean will be seen as a "positive" deviation and thus have a positive \(z\)-score.
