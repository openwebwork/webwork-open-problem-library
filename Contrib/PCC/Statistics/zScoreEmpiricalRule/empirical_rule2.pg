Suppose the scores of students on an exam are Normally distributed with a mean 
of \($mean\) and a standard deviation of \($sd\). According to the empirical rule, what percentage of students scored between \($lscore\) and \($hscore\) on the exam? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule( 15 ) \} of students scored between \($lscore\) and \($hscore\) on the exam.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Recall that according to Empirical Rule, approximately \(68%\) of observations fall within \(1\) deviation from the mean, \(95%\) of observations fall within \(2\) deviation from the mean and \(99.7%\) of observations fall within \(3\) deviation from the mean.
