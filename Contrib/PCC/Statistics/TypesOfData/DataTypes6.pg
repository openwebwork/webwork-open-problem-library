BEGIN_TEXT
The US Census Bureau conducted its 2010 survey and among the questions that were sent to US households was "Is this house, apartment, or mobile home: owned with mortgage, owned without mortgage, rented, or occupied without rent?"

If you don't get this in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
First ask what is being recorded: a home ownership/rentership status. Each time this thing is recorded, who or what is it describing?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Each time data is recorded here, it is a ownership/rentership status, and not numerical at all. So we have Categorical data, aka Qualitative data. And each time we record this data, we are describing a household, not the individuals in that household or any of the other options presented. So the answer to the first question is \{ $mcIndividuals->correct_ans() \}, and to the second is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}.
