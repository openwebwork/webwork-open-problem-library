If you don't get this in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Will respondents be giving the pollsters numerical responses? Or will they be responding with a category?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}. Each possible response from an individual is not a number, so this data is not Quantitative or Rank. Discrete data and Continuous data are special cases of Quantitative data, so these are not correct answers either. Categorical and Qualitative mean exactly the same thing, and this data is of those types, since it effectively categorizes each respondent.
