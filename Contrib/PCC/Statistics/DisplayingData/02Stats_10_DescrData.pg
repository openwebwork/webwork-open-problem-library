@solutions = ("When a distribution is skewed the right, it normally means there is some extreme data on the right hand side, or at least enough data on the right hand side that makes the distribution not symmetric.  This data on the right hand side will draw the mean (which is not resistant to outlier and large values) higher, and make it greater than the median.",

"Since quartiles are broken up into quarters, \(50$PERCENT\) of the observations in a distribution lie between the first quartile and the third quartile, \(25$PERCENT\) from quartile one to the median and \(25$PERCENT\) from the median to quatile three.",

"While havng all of the indivuadual observations is good, it is not necessary to construct a boxplot.  As long as we have the \(5\)-number summary, we have all the needed information.",

"The medain is least affected by adding large outlier.  While its value will certainly change by adding new data, it will still be ''in the middle''.",
