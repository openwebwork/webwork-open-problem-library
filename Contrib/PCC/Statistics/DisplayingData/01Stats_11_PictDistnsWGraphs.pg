BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) Note that this question deals with $BITALIC percent $EITALIC of students.  The question mentions five students total, with four students total who are not juniors.  Since this is percent, it is \(\frac{4}{5}\) or \(80$PERCENT\).

$PAR

(b) Note that this question deals with $BITALIC number $EITALIC of students.  The question mentions five students total, with four students total who are not juniors.  This means that \($ans_b\) student is a junior.
