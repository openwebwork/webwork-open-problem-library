"Although zip codes are numbers, they are not a quantity, that is, we cannot associate a unit with zip codes.  Furthermore, a zip codes of \(95817\) does not mean there are \(95817\) of anything.  Rather, zip codes are a quality, a certain number means you live in a certain area.  Thus zip codes are categorical or qualitative data.",

"The option with \(0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\) is tempting but it leaves out the \(1\), which would mean a gap in our data so to speak.  This would misrepresent our data.  We cannot use option with \(00\), etc, since it would actually represent three digit numbers since each of the ''stems'' is already two digits.
