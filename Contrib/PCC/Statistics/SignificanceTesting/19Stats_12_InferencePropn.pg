#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A new cream that advertises that it can reduce wrinkles and improve skin was subject to a recent
study. A sample of \($n\) women over the age of \(50\) used the new cream for \(6\) months. Of those \($n\)
women, \($x\) of them reported skin improvement (as judged by a dermatologist). Is this evidence that
the cream will improve the skin of more than \($perc$PERCENT\) of women over the age of \(50\)? Test
using \(\alpha = $alpha\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a)  Does the cream improve skin?  This tells us we will have a one sided hypothesis test using the \(>\) sign in our alternative hypothesis.  Since \($x\) out of \($n\) women reported improvement in skin we know that \(\hat{p} \approx $p\).  We want to test if this is evidence that the cream will improve the skin of more than \($perc$PERCENT\) of women, which means \(p=$p0\).  Thus we can find, \(\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{$p0\cdot$q0}{$n}}\approx$sd\).
$PAR
Therefore our test statistic is \(z=\frac{$p-$p0}{$sd}\approx$z\).
$PAR
(b) If our significance level is \(\alpha = $alpha\), since the question was if the cream improved skin, this means we want a right-tailed critical \(z^{*}\).  This mean only \($alpha\), or, \($alphap$PERCENT\) is above the needed \(z^{*}\).  Therefore, we can use the inverse technology command using an area of \($tot\).  Recall we do this since our technology only can shade in left and if \($totp$PERCENT\) is below the \(z^{*}\) value in question, only \($alphap$PERCENT\) is above it .  Thus, we find \(z^{*}\approx$crit\).
$PAR
(c) The final conclusion requires a \(P\)-value.  Using technology and our test statistic of \(z\approx$z\), we find a \(P\)-value of \($pval\), also seen in the graph below.
$PAR
\{Plot($diagram, tex_size=>900)\}
$PAR
The final conclusion is that: $ans[$tag]  
$PAR
This conclusion is always based on the fact that if our \(p\)-value is less than \(\alpha\) we reject the null hypothesis and if our \(P\)-value is great than \(\alpha\) we do not reject the null hypothesis.
