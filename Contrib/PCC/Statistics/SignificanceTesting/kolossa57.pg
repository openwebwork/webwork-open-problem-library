BEGIN_TEXT
Physicians at a clinic gave what they thought were drugs to \($n\) patients.  Although the doctors later learned that the drugs
were really placebos, \($a$PERCENT\) of the patients reported an improved
condition.  Assume that if the placebo is ineffective, the probability of a
patient's condition improving is \($p\).  Test the hypothesis that the proportion
of patients improving is greater than \($p\). $BR $BR 

Find the test statistic for the sample: $BR $BR

\( z =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}  $BR $BR

Find the \(P\)-value of the hypothesis test.$PAR 

\( P =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a)  We want to test the hypothesis that the proportion of patients improving is greater \($p\), this also means \(p=$p\).  This mean we will use a one sided test with the \(>\) sign in our alternative hypothesis.  Of the \($n\) patients, \($a$PERCENT\) reported improvement, this means \(\hat{p}= $adec\).  Thus we can find, \(\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{($p)($q)}{$n}} \approx $sd\).
$PAR
Therefore our test statistic is \(z=\frac{$adec-$p}{$sd}\approx$z\).
$PAR
(b)  We require technology to find a \(P\)-value.  Using technology and our test statistic of \(z\approx$z\), we find a \(P\)-value of \($pvalue\), or, \($pvalperc\), also seen in the graph below.
