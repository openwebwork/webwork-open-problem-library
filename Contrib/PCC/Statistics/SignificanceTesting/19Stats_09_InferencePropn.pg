#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A newspaper conducted a statewide survey concerning the \(2014\) race for state senator.  The newspaper took a SRS of \( n = $n[$choose] \) registered voters and found that \($x[$choose]\) would vote for the Republican candidate.  Let \(p\) represent the proportion of registered voters in the state who would vote for 
the Republican candidate.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a)  In the SRS done by the newspaper  it was found that out of \($n[$choose] \) registered voters, \($x[$choose]\) would vote for the Republican candidate.  This means \(\hat{p}\approx$phat\).  Since we know \(p=0.50 \), this means \(q=0.50 \).  Using our formula for \(\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}\), we find that,
$PAR
\(\text{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{(0.50)(0.50)}{$n[$choose]}} \approx $sigma\)
$PAR
This will allow to us to find our \(z\)-score using \(z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})}\)
$PAR
\(z=\frac{$phat-0.50}{$sigma} \approx $z\).  Therefore our \(z\)-statistic is \($z\).
$PAR
(b) For our \(P\)-value, we will need to use technology.  Since we have \( H_a: p > .50\), we will use one-sided test shaded to the right.  With technology, we obtain \(P\)-value of \($pval\).  The one sided test shading is shown below.
