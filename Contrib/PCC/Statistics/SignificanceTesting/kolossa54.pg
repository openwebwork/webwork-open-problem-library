BEGIN_TEXT
According to a recent marketing campaign, \($n\) drinkers of either Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi participated in a
blind taste test to see which of the drinks was their favorite.  In one Pepsi television commercial, an 
announcer states that "in recent blind taste tests, more than one half
of the surveyed preferred Diet Pepsi over Diet Coke."  Suppose that out of those \($n\), \($n1\)
preferred Diet Pepsi.  Using \(\alpha = $a\) as your benchmark for declaring significance, test the hypothesis that more than half of all participants will select Diet Pepsi in a blind taste test by giving the following: $BR
(a) the \(z\)-score for the sample is \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(b) the critical \(z\) score for declaring significant evidence is \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a)  Will more than half of all participants select Diet Pepsi as their preference?  This tells us we will have a one sided hypothesis test using the \(>\) sign in our alternative hypothesis.  Since \($n1\) out of \($n\) people selected Diet Pepsi we know that \(\hat{p} \approx $p\).  We want to test if this is evidence that more than half of all participants select Diet Pepsi, which means we will use \(p=0.5\).  Thus we can find, \(\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{0.5\cdot 0.5}{$n}} \approx $sd\).
$PAR
Therefore our test statistic is \(z=\frac{$p-0.5}{$sd}\approx$test\).
$PAR
(b) The critical \(z\)-score for declaring significant evidence is the same as saying ''beyond what \(z\)-score do we start rejecting the null hypothesis?''  Since our significance level is \(\alpha = $a\), and the question was if more than half of participants selected Diet Pepsi, this means we want a right-tailed critical \(z\)-score.  This mean only \($a\), or, \($ap$PERCENT\) is above the needed critical \(z\)-score.  Therefore, we can use the inverse technology command using an area of \($tot\).  Recall we do this since our technology only can shade in left and if \($totp$PERCENT\) is below the critical \(z\)-score value in question, only \($ap$PERCENT\) is above it .  Thus, we find a critical \(z\)-score of \(z\approx$z\).
$PAR
(c) The final conclusion requires a \(P\)-value.  Using technology and our test statistic of \(z\approx$test\), we find a \(P\)-value of \($pval\), also seen in the graph below.
$PAR
\{Plot($diagram, tex_size=>900)\}
$PAR
The final conclusion is that: $ans[$tag]  
$PAR
This conclusion is always based on the fact that if our \(P\)-value is less than \(\alpha\) we reject the null hypothesis and if our \(P\)-value is great than \(\alpha\) we do not reject the null hypothesis.
