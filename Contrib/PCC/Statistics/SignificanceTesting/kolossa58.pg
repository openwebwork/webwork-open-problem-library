A recent poll of \($n\) randomly selected \(18\text{-}25\)-year-olds revealed that \($x\) currently use marijuana or hashish. According to a publication, \($phat$PERCENT\) of \(18\text{-}25\)-year-olds were current users of marijuana or hashish in \(1997\). Do the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the percentage of \(18\text{-}25\)-year-olds who currently use marijuana or hashish has changed from the \(1997\) percentage of \($phat$PERCENT\)?  Use \(\alpha = $a\) as the level for declaring significance. $PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a)  We want to know if the data provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the percentage of \(18\text{-}25\)-year-olds who currently use marijuana or hashish has changed.  As there is no mention of greater than or less than, this means we will have a two sided test with \(\neq\) in our alternative hypothesis.  As the publication claimed \($phat$PERCENT\) of \(18\text{-}25\)-year-old are current users, we can say \(p=$ph\).  Using the recent poll data, we also know \(\hat{p}=$p\).
Thus we can find, \(\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{($ph)($q)}{$n}} \approx $sd\).
$PAR
Therefore our \(z\)-score is \(z=\frac{$p-$ph}{$sd}\approx$z\).
$PAR
(b) The positive critical \(z\)-score for declaring significant evidence is the same as saying ''beyond what \(z\)-score do we start rejecting the null hypothesis?''  Since our significance level is \(\alpha = $a\), we might assume to use the inverse technology command with area \($alower\).  But since we have two sided test, half of the \(\alpha\) value is on each side.  So, this means we will use area \($alower2\).  Thus we find a positive critical \(z\)-score of \($crit\).
$PAR
(c) For the negative critical \(z\)-score, we can use the symmetry of the normal curve to know that it will be the same value from part (b), but negative.  Thus, it is \(-$crit\).
$PAR
(d)  To conclude we need technology to find our \(p\)-value.  Using our test statistic of \(z\approx$z\), we find a \(P\)-value of \($pval\).  But we need a two-sided test.  Therefore, we need to double our \(P\)-value to obtain a \(p\)-value of \($pvaltwo\), or, \($pper$PERCENT\).  The two sided test shading is shown below.
$PAR
\{Plot($diagram, tex_size=>900)\}
$PAR
The final conclusion is that: $ans[$tag]
$PAR
This conclusion is always based on the fact that if our \(P\)-value is less than \(\alpha\) we reject the null hypothesis and if our \(P\)-value is great than \(\alpha\) we do not reject the null hypothesis.
