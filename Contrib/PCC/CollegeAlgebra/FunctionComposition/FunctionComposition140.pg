BEGIN_PGML

The manufacturer of a computer is offering two discounts on last year's model computer.  The first discount is at a [`\$[$rebate]`] rebate and the second discount is [`[$perc]%`] off the regular price [`p`].


a) Write a formula for a function [`f`] that that represents the sale price as a function of the regular price if only the rebate applies.  Your answer should be in the form *f(p)=...*.  

    [______________________]

a) Write a formula for a function [`g`] that that represents the sale price as a function of the regular price if only the [`[$perc]%`] discount applies. Your answer should be in the form *g(p)=...*.  

    [______________________]

a) Find [`f`] composed with [`g`] and [`g`] composed with [`f`].  Expand and simplify both answers to polynomials in standard form.

    [`(f\circ g)(p)={}`][______________________]  

    [`(g\circ f)(p)={}`][______________________]  

a)  Which combination of discounts represents a better deal for the consumer?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) A rebate reduces the cost through subtraction. So [`[$answer1]`].

a) A percentage discount reduces the cost by multiplication using the complement of the percentage discount. So [`[$answer2]`].

a) [`\begin{aligned}[t]
(f\circ g)(p)
&= f(g(p))\\
&=f([$comp]p)\\
&=[$comp]p-[$rebate]
\end{aligned}`]  
[`\begin{aligned}[t]
(g\circ f)(p)
&= g(f(p))\\
&=g(p - [$rebate])\\
&=[$comp](p-[$rebate])\\
&= [$comp]p - [$comp*$rebate]
\end{aligned}`]  

a) Comparing the formulas for [`f\circ g`] with [`g\circ f`], we see that [`f\circ g`] reduces the price by more. So we should apply the percentage discount before the rebate.
