BEGIN_PGML

Let [`s(t)=[$s]`], where [`s`] is the position (in mi) of a car driving on a straight road at time [`t`] (in hr).  The car's velocity (in mi/hr) at time [`t`] is given by [`v(t)=[$v]`].

a. _Using function notation_, express the car's position after [`[$t1]`] hours. The answer here is not a formula, it's just something using function notation like [|f(8)|]*.
    [__________]

a. Where is the car then? The answer here is a number with units.
    [__________]

a. _Use function notation_ to express the question, "When is the car going [`[$vel1]`]?" The answer is an equation that uses function notation; something like [|f(x)=23|]*. You are not being asked to actually solve the equation, just to write down the equation.
    [__________]

a. Where is the car when it is going [`[$vel2]`]? The answer here is a number with units. You are being asked a question about its position, but have been given information about its speed.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. The car's position after [`[$t1]`] hours is [`[@$ans[0]@]`], using function notation and the definition of [`s`].

a. [`\begin{aligned}[t]
s([$t1]) &= [$st1]\\
&=[@$ans[1]@]
\end{aligned}`]

a. Using function notation and the definition of [`v`], "When is the car going [`[$vel1]`]?" is the same as asking to solve the equation [`[@$ans[2]@]`].

a. "...when it is going [`[@$vel2@]`]" means we need to solve    
    [`\begin{aligned}
v(t) & = [$v2]\\
[$a] t+[$b] & = [$v2]\\
[$a] t & = [$v2-$b]\\
t &= [$time]
\end{aligned}`]  
Then we use this time and the formula for [`s`] to find the position at that time:  
    [`\begin{aligned}
s([$time]) & = [$st2]\\
&= [@$ans[3]@]
\end{aligned}`]
