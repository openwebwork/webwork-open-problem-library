BEGIN_PGML

Some equations involving [`x`] and [`y`] define [`y`] as a function of
[`x`], and others do not.  For example, if [`x+y=1`], we can solve for
[`y`] and obtain [`y = 1-x`]. And we can then think of [`y = f(x) =
1-x`].  On the other hand, if we have the equation [`x=y^2`] then
[`y`] is not a function of [`x`], since for a given positive value
of [`x`], the value of [`y`] could equal [`\sqrt{x}`] or it could equal [`-\sqrt{x}`].

On the other hand, some equations involving [`x`] and [`y`] define [`x`] as a function of [`y`] (the other way round).

BEGIN_SOLUTION

The correct answer to the first part is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}. In each of those answers, whenever a value would be substituted in for \(x\), then either there is exactly one \(y\)-value that will make the relation true, or perhaps none at all. In the other answers, there can be an \(x\)-value where more than one \(y\)-value will make the relation true.
$PAR

For the second part, the answer is \{ $mc2->correct_ans() \}. In each of those answers, whenever a value would be substituted in for \(y\), then either there is exactly one \(x\)-value that will make the relation true, or perhaps none at all. In the other answers, there can be a \(y\)-value where more than one \(x\)-value will make the relation true.
