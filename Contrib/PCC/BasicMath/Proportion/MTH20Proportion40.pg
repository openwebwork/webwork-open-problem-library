BEGIN_PGML

[$name] purchased [`[$lbs]`] pounds of apples at the total cost of [`[$totalU]`]. If [$pronoun] purchases [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples at this store, how much would it cost?

*Solution:* It would cost [__________]{$total1U} to purchase [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1:  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the cost of [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples, we first need to find the cost of each pound of apples:

    [`` \frac{[$totalU]}{[$lbs]\text{ lb}} = \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ lb}}``]

The unit price of apples is [`[$rateU]`] per pound. Next, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$lbs1] \text{ lb} \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ lb}} \\
   &= [$lbs1] \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1} \\
   &= [$lbs1] \cdot [$rateU] \\
   &= [$total1U]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* It would cost [`[$total1U]`] to purchase [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume it would cost [`x`] dollars to purchase [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples.

In the proportion, the top (numerators) have the cost in dollars, and the bottom (denominators) have the weight in pounds. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{cost of apples in dollars}}{\text{amount of apples in lb}} &=\frac{\text{cost of apples in dollars}}{\text{amount of apples in lb}} \\
   \frac{[$totalU]}{[$lbs] \text{ lb}} &= \frac{x \text{ dollars}}{[$lbs1] \text{ lb}} \\
   [$lbs]x &= [$total] \cdot [$lbs1] \\
   [$lbs]x &= [$total*$lbs1] \\
   \frac{[$lbs]x}{[$lbs]} &= \frac{[$total*$lbs1]}{[$lbs]} \\
   x &= [$total1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* It would cost [`[$total1U]`] to purchase [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples.
