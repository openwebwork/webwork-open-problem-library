BEGIN_PGML

According to a salad recipe, each serving requires [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil and [`[$vinegar1]`] teaspoons of vinegar. If [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar were used, how many teaspoons of vegetable oil should be used?

*Solution:* If [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar were used, [__________]{$oil2} teaspoons of vegetable oil should be used.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find how many teaspoons of vegetable oil is needed for [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar, we first need to find how many teaspoons of vegetable oil is needed for each teaspoon of vinegar (rate).

To find this rate, we use the given condition that each serving requires [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil and [`[$vinegar1]`] teaspoons of vinegar.

    [`` \frac{[$oil1] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}}{[$vinegar1] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}} = [$rateOV] \frac{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}}{\text{per teaspoon of vinegar}} ``]

The rate is [`[$rateOV] \frac{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}}{\text{per teaspoon of vinegar}}`]. Next, we use the "cancel unit" method:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$vinegar2] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \cdot [$rateOV] \frac{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}}{\text{per teaspoon of vinegar}} \\
   &= [$vinegar2] \cdot [$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} \\
   &= \frac{[$vinegar2]}{1} \cdot [$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} \\
   &= \frac{[$vinegar2] \cdot [$rateOVNum]}{1 \cdot [$rateOVDen]} \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} \\
   &= \frac{[$vinegar2*$rateOVNum]}{[$rateOVDen]} \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} \\
   &= [$oil2] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* If [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar were used, [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil should be used.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume if [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil were used, [`x`] teaspoons of vinegar should be used. 

In the proportion, the top (numerators) have the number of teaspoons of vinegar, and the bottom (denominators) have the number of teaspoons of vegetable oil. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}} &= \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}} \\
   \frac{[$vinegar1] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{[$oil1] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}} &= \frac{x \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{[$oil2] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}} \\
   [$oil1]x &= [$vinegar1] \cdot [$oil2] \\
   [$oil1]x &= [$vinegar1*$oil2] \\
   \frac{[$oil1]x}{[$oil1]} &= \frac{[$vinegar1*$oil2]}{[$oil1]} \\
   x &= [$vinegar2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* If [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar were used, [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil should be used.
