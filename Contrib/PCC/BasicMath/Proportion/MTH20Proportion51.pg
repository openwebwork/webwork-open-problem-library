BEGIN_PGML

[$name] collected a total of [`[$total]`] stamps over the past [`[$years]`] years. At this rate, how many years would it take [$pronoun] to collect [`[$total1]`] stamps?

*Solution:* At this rate, [$name] can collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [_________]{$years1} years.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the number of stamps to be collected in [`[$years1]`] years, we need to find the number of stamps collected per year (rate):

    [`` \frac{[$total] \text{ stamps}}{[$years]\text{ years}} = \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}}``]

So, [$name] collected [`[$rate]`] stamps per year.

Next, we cannot do [`[$total1] \text{ stamps} \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}} `], because the unit "stamps" will not cancel. Instead, we have to flip the rate [`\frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}}`] and have [`\frac{1 \text{ year}}{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}`].

Next, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$total1] \text{ stamps} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ year}}{[$rate] \text{ stamps}} \\
   &=[$total1] \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ years} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ years} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rate]} \text{ years} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{[$rate]} \text{ years} \\
   &= [$years1] \text{ years}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* At this rate, [$name] can collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [`[$years1]`] years.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume it would take [$name] [`x`] years to collect [`[$total1]`] stamps.

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have the number of stamps collected, and the denominators (bottom) have the number of years. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{number of stamps}}{\text{number of years}} &= \frac{\text{number of stamps}}{\text{number of years}} \\
   \frac{[$total] \text{ stamps}}{[$years] \text{ years}} &= \frac{[$total1] \text{ stamps}}{x \text{ years}} \\
   [$total]x &= [$total1] \cdot [$years] \\
   [$total]x &= [$total1*$years] \\
   \frac{[$total]x}{[$total]} &= \frac{[$total1*$years]}{[$total]} \\
   x &= [$years1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* At this rate, [$name] can collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [`[$years1]`] years.
