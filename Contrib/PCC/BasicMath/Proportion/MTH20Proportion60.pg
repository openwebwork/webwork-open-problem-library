BEGIN_PGML

In a city, the owner of a house valued at [`[$value]`] thousand dollars needs to pay [`[$taxU]`] in property tax. At this tax rate, how much property tax should the owner pay if a house is valued at [`[$value1]`] thousand dollars?

*Solution:* The owner of a [`[$value1]`]-thousand-dollar house should pay [_________]{$tax1U} in property tax.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the amount of tax for a [`[$value1]`]-thousand-dollar house, we first need to find the tax rate for each thousand dollars of property value:

    [`` \frac{[$tax]\text{ dollars in tax}}{[$value] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} = \frac{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}}{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}}``]

Next, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$value1] \text{ thousand dollars in property value} \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}}{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} \\
   &= [$value1] \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}}{1} \\
   &= [$value1] \cdot [$rate] \text{ dollars in tax} \\
   &= [$tax1] \text{ dollars in tax}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The owner of a [`[$value1]`]-thousand-dollar house should pay [`[$tax1U]`] in property tax.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume the owner of a [`[$value1]`]-thousand-dollar house should pay [`\$ x`] in property tax.

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have property tax in dollars, and the denominators (bottom) have property value in thousand dollars. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{ dollars in property tax}}{\text{ thousand dollars in property value}} &= \frac{\text{ dollars in property tax}}{\text{ thousand dollars in property value}} \\
   \frac{[$tax] \text{ dollars in property tax}}{[$value] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} &= \frac{x \text{ dollars in property tax}}{[$value1] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} \\
   [$value]x &= [$tax] \cdot [$value1] \\
   [$value]x &= [$tax*$value1] \\
   \frac{[$value]x}{[$value]} &= \frac{[$tax*$value1]}{[$value]} \\
   x &= [$tax1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The owner of a [`[$value1]`]-thousand-dollar house should pay [`[$tax1U]`] in property tax.
