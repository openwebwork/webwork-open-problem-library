A mutual fund consists of [`[$stock]`][@$PERCENT@] stock and [`[$bond]`][@$PERCENT@] bond. In other words, for each [`[$stock]`] of stock, there are [`[$bond]`] dollars of bond. For a mutual fund with [`[$bond1C]`] of bond, how many dollars of stock are there?

Fill in the blank with decimal rounded to the hundredth place.

For a mutual fund with [`[$bond1C]`] of bond, there are approximately [___________]{$stock1C} of stock.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

First, we will use rate to solve this problem.

To find the amount of bond corresponding to [`[$bond1C]`] of bond, we first need to find the amount of stock corresponding to each dollar of bond (rate):

    [`` \frac{\text{value of stock}}{\text{value of bond}} = \frac{[$stock]\text{ dollars in stock}}{[$bond]\text{ dollars in bond}} \approx \frac{[$rateSBR] \text{ dollars in stock}}{1 \text{ dollar in bond}}``]

For each dollar of bond, there are approximately [`[$rateSBR]`] dollars of stock. The problem asks us to round the final answer to the hundredth place (2 decimal places). For intermediate steps, we should round to a few more places.

Next, we will use this rate to find the amount of stock corresponding to [`[$bond1C]`] of bond:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$bond1C] \text{ in bond} \cdot \frac{[$rateSBR] \text{ dollars in stock}}{$1 \text{ in bond}} \\
   &= [$bond1] \cdot \frac{[$rateSBR] \text{ dollars in stock}}{1} \\
   &= [$bond1] \cdot [$rateSBR] \text{ dollars in stock} \\
   &= [$bond1*$rateSBR] \text{ dollars in stock} \\
   &\approx [$stock1C] \text{ dollars in stock} 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* For a mutual fund with [`[$bond1C]`] of bond, there are approximately [`[$stock1C]`] of stock.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume that for a mutual fund with [`[$bond1C]`] of bond, there are approximately [`x`] dollars of stock. 

In the proportion, the top (numerators) have the amount of stock, and the bottom (denominators) have the amount of bond. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{amount of stock in dollars}}{\text{amount of bond in dollars}} &=\frac{\text{amount of stock in dollars}}{\text{amount of bond in dollars}} \\
   \frac{[$stockC] \text{ in stock}}{[$bondC] \text{ in bond}} &= \frac{\$ x \text{ in stock}}{[$bond1C] \text{ in bond}} \\
   [$bond]x &= [$stock] \cdot [$bond1] \\
   [$bond]x &= [$stock*$bond1] \\
   \frac{[$oil1]x}{[$bond]} &= \frac{[$stock*$bond1]}{[$bond]} \\
   x &= [$stock1] \approx [$stock1R]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* For a mutual fund with [`[$bond1C]`] of bond, there are approximately [`[$stock1C]`] of stock.
