BEGIN_PGML

A mutual fund consists of [`[$stock]`][@$PERCENT@] stock and [`[$bond]`][@$PERCENT@] bond. In other words, for each [`[$stock]`] of stock, there are [`[$bond]`] dollars of bond. For a mutual fund with [`[$stock1C]`] of stock, how many dollars of bond are there?

Fill in the blank with decimal rounded to the hundredth place.

For a mutual fund with [`[$stock1C]`] of stock, there are approximately [___________]{$bond1C} of bond.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

First, we will use rate to solve this problem.

To find the amount of bond corresponding to [`[$stock1C]`] of stock, we first need to find the amount of bond corresponding to each dollar of stock (rate):

    [`` \frac{\text{value of bond}}{\text{value of stock}} = \frac{[$bond]\text{ dollars in bond}}{[$stock]\text{ dollars in stock}} \approx \frac{[$rateBSR] \text{ dollars in bond}}{$1 \text{ in stock}}``]

For each dollar of stock, there are approximately [`[$rateBSR]`] dollars of bond. The problem asks us to round the final answer to the hundredth place (2 decimal places). For intermediate steps, we should round to a few more places.

Next, we will use this rate to find the amount of bond corresponding to [`[$stock1C]`] of stock:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$stock1C] \text{ in stock} \cdot \frac{[$rateBSR] \text{ dollars in bond}}{$1 \text{ in stock}} \\
   &= [$stock1] \cdot \frac{[$rateBSR] \text{ dollars in bond}}{1} \\
   &= [$stock1] \cdot [$rateBSR] \text{ dollars in bond} \\
   &= [$stock1*$rateBSR] \text{ dollars in bond} \\
   &\approx [$bond1R] \text{ dollars in bond} 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* For a mutual fund with [`[$stock1C]`] of stock, there are approximately [`[$bond1C]`] of bond.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume that for a mutual fund with [`[$stock1C]`] of stock, there are approximately [`x`] dollars of bond. 

In the proportion, the top (numerators) have the amount of stock, and the bottom (denominators) have the amount of bond. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{amount of stock in dollars}}{\text{amount of bond in dollars}} &=\frac{\text{amount of stock in dollars}}{\text{amount of bond in dollars}} \\
   \frac{[$stockC] \text{ in stock}}{[$bondC] \text{ in bond}} &= \frac{[$stock1C] \text{ in stock}}{\$ x \text{ in bond}} \\
   [$stock]x &= [$stock1] \cdot [$bond] \\
   [$stock]x &= [$stock1*$bond] \\
   \frac{[$oil1]x}{[$stock]} &= \frac{[$stock1*$bond]}{[$stock]} \\
   x &= [$bond1] \approx [$bond1R]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* For a mutual fund with [`[$stock1C]`] of stock, there are approximately [`[$bond1C]`] of bond.
