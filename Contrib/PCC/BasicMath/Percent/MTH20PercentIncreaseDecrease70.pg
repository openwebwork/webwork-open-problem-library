BEGIN_PGML

Last year, a small town had [`[$original]`] population. This year, the population decreased to [`[$new]`]. What is the percentage decrease of the town's population?

Fill in blank with a percent. Round your answer to two decimal places, like [`1.23%`].

*Solution:* The percentage decrease of the town's population was approximately [________]{$ans}.

$s2 = 100-$per;

$connector = '=';

};

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To calculate the percentage increase/decrease, first we find the amount of increase/decrease by doing a simple subtraction calculation, 
and then we find the percentage increase/decrease.

In this problem, the amount of decrease is [`[$original]-[$new]=[$decrease]`].

Since the city's population was initially [`[$original]`], we need to ask: [`[$decrease]`] is what percent of [`[$original]`]?

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem.

Assume [`[$decrease]`] is [`x%`] of [` [$original] `], so "[`x`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$decrease]`] out of [`[$original]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{100} &= \frac{[$decrease]}{[$original]} \\
   [$original]x &= [$decrease] \cdot 100 \\
   [$original]x &= [$decrease*100] \\
   \frac{[$original]x}{[$original]} &= \frac{[$decrease*100]}{[$original]} \\
   x &\approx [$decNotRounded*100] \\
   x &\approx [$per]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The percentage decrease of the town's population was approximately [`[$per]%`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem.

This translation from English to may  should help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \Longleftrightarrow 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

Let the decrease [`[$decrease]`] be [`x`] (as a percent) of [`[$original]`]. That means:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$decrease]   &= x \cdot [$original] \\
  \frac{[$decrease]}{[$original]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$original]}{[$original]} \\
  [$decNotRounded]       & [$connector]  x\\
  x &[$connector]  [$per]% \\
\end{aligned}
`]

*Solution:* The percentage decrease of the town's population was approximately [`[$per]%`].

####Method 3  

We first divide the "new number" by the "original number":

    [`` \frac{[$new]}{[$original]} \approx [$s1] \approx [$s2]% ``]

So the new number is [`[$s2]%`] of the original number, implying the percentage decrease is [` 100% - [$s2]% = [$per]% `].

*Solution:* The percentage decrease of the town's population was approximately [`[$per]%`].
