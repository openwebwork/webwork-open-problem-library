BEGIN_PGML

We typically give [`15%`] tip, and we need to learn how to find [`15%`] of a certain number without using a calculator or paper/pencil.

a) [` 15% `] of [` [$num0C] `] is [_______]{$ans0C}?
b) [` 15% `] of [` [$num1C] `] is [_______]{$ans1C}?
c) [` 15% `] of [` [$num2C] `] is [_______]{$ans2C}?

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To find [`15%`] of a number, first we find [`10%`] of the number and [`5%`] of the number, and then add up those two parts.

----

*Part a)* [`10%`] of [`[$num0]`] is [`[$num0]\div 10=[$num0/10]`].

[`5%`] of [`[$num0]`] is half of [`10%`] of [`[$num0]`], which is [`[$num0/10]\div 2=[$num0/20]`].

Finally, we add up those two parts, and we have [`[$num0/10]+[$num0/20]=[$ans0]`].

*Solution:* [` 15% `] of [` [$num0C] `] is [`[$ans0C]`].

----

*Part b)* [`10%`] of [`[$num1]`] is [`[$num1]\div 10=[$num1/10]`].

[`5%`] of [`[$num1]`] is half of [`10%`] of [`[$num1]`], which is [`[$num1/10]\div 2=[$num1/20]`].

Finally, we add up those two parts, and we have [`[$num1/10]+[$num1/20]=[$ans1]`].

*Solution:* [` 15% `] of [` [$num1C] `] is [`[$ans1C]`].

----

*Part c)* [`10%`] of [`[$num2]`] is [`[$num2]\div 10=[$num2/10]`].

[`5%`] of [`[$num2]`] is half of [`10%`] of [`[$num2]`], which is [`[$num2/10]\div 2=[$num2/20]`].

Finally, we add up those two parts, and we have [`[$num2/10]+[$num2/20]=[$ans2]`].

*Solution:* [` 15% `] of [` [$num2C] `] is [`[$ans2C]`].
