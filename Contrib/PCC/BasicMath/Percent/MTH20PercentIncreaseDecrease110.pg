BEGIN_PGML

Your salary used to be [`[$cs]`] per year.

You had to take a [`[$r]%`] pay cut. After the cut, your salary was [___________]{$cans1} per year.

Then, you earned a [`[$r]%`] raise. After the raise, your salary was [___________]{$cans2} per year.

$s1 = $r/100;


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Question 1  

Your original salary was [`[$cs]`] per year. The amount of cut was [`[$r]%`] of [`[$cs]`]. There are two methods to find this amount.

We can use proportion. Let [`x`] dollars be the amount of decrease, then we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{[$s]} &= \frac{[$r]}{100} \\
   100x &= [$s]\cdot[$r] \\
   100x &= [$s*$r] \\
   \frac{100x}{100} &= \frac{[$s*$r]}{100} \\
   x &= [$s*$r/100]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Or we can use the percentage formula to find the amount of increase:

    [`` [$s1] \cdot [$cs] = [$s1*$cs] ``]

After the cut, your salary became [` [$cs]-[$s1*$cs] = [$cans1] `] dollars per year.

####Question 2  

Next, the amount of pay raise was [`[$r]%`] of [`[$cans1]`]. Notice that it's incorrect to find [`[$r]%`] of [`[$cs]`], because the annual salary has changed from [`[$cs]`] to [`[$cans1]`].

We will first use proportion to find the amount of pay cut. Assume the amount of pay cut was [`x`] dollars. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{[$ans1]} &= \frac{[$r]}{100} \\
   100x &= [$ans1]\cdot[$r] \\
   100x &= [$ans1*$r] \\
   \frac{100x}{100} &= \frac{[$ans1*$r]}{100} \\
   x &= [$ans1*$r/100]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Or we can use the percentage formula to find the amount of pay cut:

    [`` [$s1] \cdot [$cans1] = [$s1*$cans1] ``]

After the raise, your salary became [` [$cans1]+[$s1*$cans1] = [$cans2] `] per year.

After a cut and a raise of the same rate, your salary decreased! This is because the rate of cut was based on a bigger salary, while the rate of raise was based on a smaller salary (after the cut).
