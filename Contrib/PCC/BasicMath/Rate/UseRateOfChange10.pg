BEGIN_PGML

According to a salad recipe, each teaspoon of vegetable oil should be mixed with [`[$rateOV]`] teaspoons of vinegar.

Fill in the blanks.

*Question 1:* By this recipe, [_______]{$vinegar1} teaspoons of vinegar should be mixed with [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil.

----

*Question 2:* By this recipe, [_______]{$oil2} teaspoons of vegetable oil should be mixed with [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

There is more than one way to do these problems. I will show the "cancelling unit" method. You can use your own method as long as you get the correct answer.

It's given that each teaspoon of vegetable oil should be mixed with [`[$rateOV]`] teaspoons of vinegar. This rate can be written as either [`\frac{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}{[$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}`], or [`\frac{[$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}`]. In the following two questions, we will use one of these two rates based on what's given.

*Question 1:* It's given that we have [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil. We need to pick the fraction with "teaspoons of vegetable oil" in the denominator, so the units can cancel:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$oil1] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} \cdot \frac{[$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}  \\
   &= [$oil1] \cdot \frac{[$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{1} \\
   &= [$oil1] \cdot [$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \\
   &= [$vinegar1] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

By this recipe, [`[$vinegar1]`] teaspoons of vinegar should be mixed with [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil.

*Question 2:* It's given that we have [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar. We need to pick the fraction with "teaspoons of vinegar" in the denominator, so the units can cancel:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$vinegar2] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}{[$rateOV] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}} \\
   &= [$vinegar2] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}{[$rateOV]} \\
   &= \frac{[$vinegar2]}{1} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}{[$rateOV]} \\
   &= \frac{[$oil2]}{1} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ teaspoon of vegetable oil}}{1} \\
   &= [$oil2] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

By this recipe, [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil should be mixed with [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar.
