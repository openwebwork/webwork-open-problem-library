BEGIN_PGML

A team is climbing a mountain, which is [`[$total]`] meters high. The team plans to climb [`[$rate]`] meters every day. How many days would it take the team to climb to the top?

Solution: It would take the team [____________]{$days} days to climb to the top.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We can address this problem as "repeatedly taking away [`[$rate]`] meters from [`[$total]`] meters," which implies a division problem:

    [`` [$total] \div [$rate] = [$days] ``]

*Solution:* It would take the team [`[$days]`] days to climb to the top.

We should get used to using the fraction line instead of the division symbol:

    [`` \frac{[$total]}{[$rate]}=[$days] ``]
