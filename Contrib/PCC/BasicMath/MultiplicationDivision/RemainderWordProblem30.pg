TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A school is planning for a field trip for [`[$total]`] students and staff. Each school bus can hold [`[$each]`] people. How many school buses are needed?

*Solution:* [______]{$busesNeeded} school buses are needed.

END_PGML

$s1 = $total/$each;
if ($s1*100!=int($s1*100)) {
   $s1 =  sprintf("%.2f",$s1);
   $symbol = "\approx";
} else {
   $symbol = "=";
}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We can address this problem as "repeatedly taking away [`[$each]`] people from [`[$total]`] people, which implies a division problem:

    [`` [$total] \div [$each] [$symbol] [$s1] ``]

The decimal quotient implies [`[$each]`] doesn't go into [`[$total]`] evenly, so the last bus will not be filled with people.

There is no need to find the remainder of this division, because we need one more bus to hold the last group of people anyway.

*Solution:* [`[$busesNeeded]`] buses are needed.
