BEGIN_PGML

In a class, the teacher will hand out [`[$total]`] marbles to all his [`[$numStudents]`] students evenly. How many marbles will each student receive? How many marbles will be left over?

*Solution:* 

Each student will receive [_______]{$each} marbles.

There will be [_______]{$remainder} left-over marbles.

END_PGML

$s1 = $total/$numStudents;
if ($s1*100!=int($s1*100)) {
   $s1 =  sprintf("%.2f",$s1);
   $symbol = "\approx";
} else {
   $symbol = "=";
}
$s2 = $each*$numStudents;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Division is used when we divide a number of objects evenly into groups. In this problem, we divide [`[$total]`] marbles evenly among [`[$numStudents]`] students, and we have:

    [`` [$total] \div [$numStudents] [$symbol] [$s1] ``]

The decimal quotient implies [`[$numStudents]`] doesn't go into [`[$total]`] evenly, so there will be left-over marbles.

Notice that the integer part of [`[$s1]`] is [`[$each]`]. This implies each student will get [`[$each]`] marbles.

If each student gets [`[$each]`] marbles, [`[$numStudents]`] students will get [` [$each] \cdot [$numStudents] = [$s2] `] marbles.

Once [`[$s2]`] marbles out of [`[$total]`] were handed out, there will be [`[$total]-[$s2]=[$remainder]`] left-over marbles.

We can re-write the division equation as:

    [`` [$total] \div [$numStudents] = [$each] \text{ R } [$remainder] ``]

The character *R* represents "remainder".

*Solution:* 

Each student will receive [`[$each]`] marbles.

There will be [`[$remainder]`] left-over marbles.
