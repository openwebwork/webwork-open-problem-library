BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To find all factors of a number, we start from the number [`1`], and go up one by one until we "meet" a factor we already found. We always find pairs of factors.

Let's find all factors of [`18`] as an example.

* We start from [`1`]. Since [` 18 \div 1 = 18 `], we found two factors: [`1`] and [`18`]. Now the factor list has [` ~~{1, 18 ~~}`].
* Next number is [`2`]. Since [` 18 \div 2 = 9 `], we found two factors: [`2`] and [`9`]. Now the factor list has [` ~~{1, 2, 9, 18 ~~}`].
* Next number is [`3`]. Since [` 18 \div 3 = 6 `], we found two factors: [`3`] and [`6`]. Now the factor list has [` ~~{1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 ~~}`].
* Next number is [`4`]. Since [` 18 \div 4 = 4.5 `], [`4`] is not a factor of [`18`].
* Next number is [`5`]. Since [` 18 \div 5 = 3.6 `], [`5`] is not a factor of [`18`].
* Next number is [`6`]. Since we already have [`6`] in the list of factors, we are done.

We have found all factors of [`18`]: [` ~~{1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 ~~} `].

With this method, we can find all factors of [`[$num]`]. We will show the first few step:

* We start from [`1`]. Since [` [$num] \div 1 = [$num] `], we found two factors: [`1`] and [` [$num] `]. Now the factor list has [` ~~{1, [$num] ~~}`].
* Next number is [`2`]. Since [` [$num] \div 2 = [$s1] `], [$output1]**
* Next number is [`3`]. Since [` [$num] \div 3 = [$s2] `], [$output2]**
* ...

In the end, [`[$num]`] has the following factors: [` ~~{[$ans] ~~}`]. Since [`[$num]`] only has [`2`] factors, it is a prime number.
