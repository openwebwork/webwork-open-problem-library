BEGIN_PGML

Here is a list of some cities' population:

    [`` [$listComma] ``]

The mean of these cities' population is [___________]{$mean}.

The median of these cities' population is [___________]{$median}.

Which number, mean or median, is a better way to represent these cities' population?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Find the mean  

To find the mean of a group of numbers, we first add up all numbers and find their sum:

    [`` \text{sum} = [$listAdd] = [$sum] ``]

Next, we divide the sum by how many numbers there are:

    [`` \text{mean} = \frac{[$sum]}{[$dim]} = [$mean] ``]

*Solution:* The mean of these cities' population is [`[$mean]`].

####Find the median

To find the median of a list of number, we first need to order these numbers from smallest to largest:

    [`` [$listOrdered] ``]

The number in the middle is the median: [`[$median]`].

*Solution:* The median of these cities' population is [` [$median] `].

####Mean or median?

This group of data has an outlier, a number significantly bigger or smaller than the other numbers in the group. The outlier is $[`[$outlier]`]. This number significantly decreased the mean.

If we say these cities' population is approximately [`[$mean]`], it gives people a false impression that most cities in this group have a population of about [`[$mean]`].

Median can "cancel out" outliers. In this case, the median is [`[$median]`]. It's true that most cities in this group have a population of about [`[$median]`].

When there are outliers in a group of number, the median is a better way to represent the group of data. When there are no outliers, either mean or median can be used.
