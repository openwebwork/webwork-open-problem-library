These are initial problem submissions for me to test that I understand the process.
If this goes well, I will have LOTS of problems coming next, more from a Partial
Differential Equations course, and many from a Finite Math course.  I have them
tagged and hope that they can be put into the OPL.  So far, the OPL has only 64
problems under the PDE Chapter, and I don't think there are any associated with
the same text.  

This batch contains 12 basic / introductory problems from a PDE course.  The 
text used in the course is Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by
Brown & Churchill (8th Ed), but these intro problems do not come from that text.  Many
of the next batch of problems will, though.  

I think I'm using the latest requested formats in terms of DB chapters, etc.
The selections for Sections under the Chapter of "Partial Differential Equations"
are pretty slim, so in some problems I don't specify a specific Section, but have
a comment in the next line for a suggested section, "Solutions and boundary conditions". 

Please let me know if I need to correct any of what I'm doing with these submissions,
or if it looks good for me to start polishing and uploading more.  

I don't know of any other Github users who should be modifying these problems except
for the folks who maintain the OPL.   

If you can, please drop me a note to let me know this content is received, so I
know I'm doing it right: ken.luther@valpo.edu. 

Thanks!
