For the function
>> [`` r(x) = \frac{x^2 - [$a**2]}{x^2 - [$a+$b]x + [$a*$b]},``] <<
determine:

    The domain of the function:  
    [` x \in `] [___]{$dom}{20} _(write your answer as an interval or union of intervals, e.g., [|(-Inf,5)U[12,18)|]*)_

    The locations of all vertical asymptotes of [`r`]:  
    [` x = `] [___]{$vert}{10} _(if there are none, enter *none*; if there eare more than one, enter as a comma-separated list)_

    The locations of all holes in the graph of [`r`]:  
    [` x = `] [___]{$hole}{10} _(if there are none, enter *none*; if there eare more than one, enter as a comma-separated list)_

    The locations of all zeros of [`r`]:  
    [` x = `] [___]{$zero}{10} _(if there are none, enter *none*; if there eare more than one, enter as a comma-separated list)_

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Factor the numerator and denominator to write 
>> [`` r(x) = \frac{(x-[$a])(x+[$a])}{(x-[$a])(x-[$b])}. ``] <<
Note that [`r`] is not defined when [`x = [$a]`] or [`x = [$b]`], so these
are the only values missing from its domain.  When [`x = [$b]`], the
denominator is zero but the numerator isn't (since [`[$a] \ne [$b]`]),
and thus the function has a vertical asymptote there.  At [`x = [$a]`],
however, both the numerator and denominator are zero (due to linear terms),
and this leads to a hole rather than a vertical asymptote on the graph of
[`r`].  Finally, when [`x = -[$a]`], the numerator is zero and the
denominator is not (since [`-[$a] \ne [$b]`]), and thus [`x = -[$a]`] is a
zero of the function.
