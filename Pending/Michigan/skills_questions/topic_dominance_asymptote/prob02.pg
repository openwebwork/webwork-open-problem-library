BEGIN_PGML

For each of the following functions, determine the exact location
of the horizontal asymptote(s).  For each, consider what happens as
[`x \to -\infty`] and [`x \to \infty`].  If the function increases
or decreases without bound in that direction, write "none."

    [` [$show[0]] `]  
        as [` x\to-\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[0]->[0]}{10}  
        as [` x\to\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[0]->[1]}{10}  
    [` [$show[1]] `]  
        as [` x\to-\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[1]->[0]}{10}  
        as [` x\to\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[1]->[1]}{10}  
    [` [$show[2]] `]  
        as [` x\to-\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[2]->[0]}{10}  
        as [` x\to\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[2]->[1]}{10}  
    [` [$show[3]] `]  
        as [` x\to-\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[3]->[0]}{10}  
        as [` x\to\infty, `] asymptote [` y = `] [___]{$answ[3]->[1]}{10}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For each of these, we use the fact that as [`x\to\infty`],
[` e^{-x} \to 0 `] and [` e^{x} \to \infty `].  Thus, whenever we have
an exponential with [` -[$k] x `] or [` -[$k] x^2 `] in the exponent, the
exponential goes to zero, and when the exponent is positive ([`[$k] x`]
or [`[$k] x^2`]) it diverges.
