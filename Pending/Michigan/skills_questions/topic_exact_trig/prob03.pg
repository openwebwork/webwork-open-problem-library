BEGIN_PGML

The height of a mass attached to a spring is given by
>> [`` h(t) = [$a]\sin([$b](t-[$k])) + [$c]. ``] <<
where [`h`] is measured in inches and [`t`] is measured in seconds
([`t \ge 0`]).  Find, exactly, the first two times at which 
[`h = [$hval]`] (your answer should not involve any trigonometric
functions).

    [`t_1 = `] [___]{$t1}{10}  
    [`t_2 = `] [___]{$t2}{10}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We want to know when
>> [``[$c] - \frac{[$a]}{2} = [$a] \sin([$b](t-k)) + [$c]. ``] <<
To solve for [`t`], we first solve for [`\sin([$b](t-[$k]))`].
Subtracting [`[$c]`] from both sides, simplifying, and dividing by
[`[$a]`], it follows that
>> [``-\frac{1}{2} = \sin([$b](t-[$k])). ``] <<
To solve the equation [`\sin(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}`] for the first
two angles [`\theta`] that make it true, we note from the unit circle
that [`\theta = \frac{7\pi}{6}`] or [`\theta = \frac{11\pi}{6}`].  Thus,
from our most recent equation above,
>> [`` [$b](t-[$k]) = \frac{7\pi}{6} \quad \mbox{or} \quad
[$b](t-[$k]) = \frac{11\pi}{6}. ``] <<
Solving each of these equations for [`t`], we find that
>> [`` t = [$k] + \frac{7\pi}{[$b*6]} \quad \mbox{or} \quad
       t = [$k] + \frac{11\pi}{[$b*6]}. ``] <<
