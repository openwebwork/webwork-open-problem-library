BEGIN_PGML

Recall that the equation of a circle of radius [`r`] centered at the
point [`(x_0,y_0)`] is given by
>> [`` (x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 = r^2. ``] <<
Find an equation for the [$tb] half of a circle centered at
[`([$a],[$b])`] of radius [`[$c]`].

    [` y = `] [___]{$eqn}{25}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Note that the equation for the circle with which we are working is
>> [`` (x - [$a])^2 + (y - [$b])^2 = [$c**2]. ``] <<
We can solve for [`y`] by first subtracting the term involving [`x`]
from both sides of the equation, to get
>> [`` (y - [$b])^2 = [$c**2] - (x - [$a])^2, ``] <<
taking the square root of both sides and adding [`[$a]`] to both
sides of the equation.  We then have
>> [`` y  = \pm\sqrt{[$c**2] - (x - [$a])^2} + [$a], ``] <<
and we must pick the sign according to which half of the circle we
want.  Here we want the [$tb] half, and so pick the [`[$sign]`] sign, so that
>> [`` y  = [$sgn]\sqrt{[$c**2] - (x - [$a])^2} + [$a]. ``] <<
