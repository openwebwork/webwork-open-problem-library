Note that if \( x = \log($a) \), then \( 10^x = $a \), so
we are looking for a value of \( x \) so that \( 10 \) to that
power will equal \($a\).  We can determine this by looking at
successive powers of \(10\): \(10^0 = 1\), \(10^1 = 10\),
\(10^2 = 100\), and so on.  Thus our ordering must be
\[ $alist \]

} else {
    $soln_cont =<<EOS;
Note that if \( x = \log($a) = -\log($ai) \), then \( 10^{-x} = $ai \), so
we are looking for a value of \( x \) so that \( 10 \) to the negative of
that power will equal \($a\).  We can determine this by looking at
successive powers of \(10\): \(10^0 = 1\),
\(10^{-1} = \frac1{10^1} = \frac1{10}\),
\(10^{-2} = \frac1{10^{2}} = \frac1{100}\), and so on.
Thus our ordering must be
\[ $alist \]

BEGIN_PGML

Order the following list of numbers from smallest to largest:
>> [`` [$uolist] ``] <<

Ordered: [___]{$list}{20}
_(Enter your answer as a comma separated list.)_

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

All of the elements in the list save for [` \log([$a]) `] are
obvious:
>> [`` -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 ``]. <<
The only question is where to place the value of [`\log([$a])`].
