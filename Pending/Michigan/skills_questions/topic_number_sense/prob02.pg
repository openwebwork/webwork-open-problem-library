Note that if \( x = \ln($a) \), then \( e^x = 2.71828^x = $a \), so
we are looking for a value of \( x \) so that \( 2.71828 \) to that
power will equal \($a\).  We can determine this by looking at
successive powers of \(2\) and \(3\): 
\(2^0 = 3^0 = 1\); \(2^1 = 2\) and \(3^1 = 3\) (so that
\(2 < e^1 < 3\)); \(2^2 = 4\), \(3^2 = 9\) (so that
\(4 < e^2 < 9\)); \(2^3 = 8\), \(3^3 = 27\), and so on.
Thus our ordering must be
\[ $alist \]

} else {
    $soln_cont =<<EOS;
Note that if \( x = \ln($a) = -\ln($ai) \), then
\( e^{-x} = 2.71828^{-x} = $ai \), so
we are looking for a value of \( x \) so that \( 10 \) to the negative of
that power will equal \($a\).  We can determine this by looking at
successive powers of \(2\) and \(3\): \(2^0 = 3^0 = 1\);
\(2^{-1} = \frac1{2^1} = \frac1{2}\) and \(3^{-1} = \frac13\) (so that
\(\frac13 < e^{-1} < \frac12\));
\(2^{-2} = \frac1{2^{2}} = \frac1{4}\) and
\(3^{-2} = \frac19\) (so that \(\frac19 < e^{-2} < \frac14\));
and so on: \(\frac1{27} < e^{-3} < \frac18\), etc.
Thus our ordering must be
\[ $alist \]

BEGIN_PGML

Order the following list of numbers from smallest to largest:
>> [`` [$uolist] ``] <<

Ordered: [___]{$list}{20}
_(Enter your answer as a comma separated list.)_

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

All of the elements in the list save for [` \ln([$a]) `] are
obvious:
>> [`` -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 ``]. <<
The only question is where to place the value of [`\ln([$a])`].
