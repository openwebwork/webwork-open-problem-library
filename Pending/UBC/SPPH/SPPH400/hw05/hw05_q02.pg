This question makes use of your personal data set, that has been worked on over the duration of the course.  The data will appear here again $BBOLD (\{ htmlLink($local_url, "Download the csv file here") \}) $EBOLD, although this is the same personal-data that you have been working with on previous assignments in the course.  Recall, that the end goal of this analysis is to estimate the effect of smoking on FEV.  We would like to remove any confounding with the smoking effect.  We begin doing that now, and in the next course (SPPH 500) we further develop our methods for doing this.  There are many different approaches you may take with the following questions.  Make sure to outline your approach clearly and concisely.  
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (a) (On-Paper) $EBOLD  Does there appear to be any relationship between Smoking and FEV?  Include a relevant plot to describe this relationship.  Based only on this bivariate analysis only, what would you conclude the smoking effect on FEV to be?
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) (On-Paper) $EBOLD Does there appear to be any relationship between Smoking and Age?  Include a relevant plot to describe this relationship.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) (On-Paper) $EBOLD Does there appear to be any relationship between Age and FEV?  Include a relevant plot to describe this relationship.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) (On-Paper) $EBOLD Coming back to something encountered on Assignment 3, draw a diagram that summarizes the relationship between Smoking, Age and FEV.  If two variables are associated, connect them using a line.  If you believe that the association has a direction (e.g. changes in X1 influence X2 to change), add an arrow head to the line to indicate the direction of the association.  Based on the drawing of this diagram, can you comment on why you believe you may have observed the relationship you did in part (a)?  Do you really believe the Smoking effect described in part (a) truly captures the relationship between Smoking and FEV?
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) (On-Paper) $EBOLD Fit a multiple linear regression model with FEV as the outcome, including both Smoke and Age as explanatory variables.  What is the estimated smoking effect, adjusted for Age?  How does this compare to the smoking effect estimated in part (a)?
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (f) (On-Paper) $EBOLD  Fit a multiple linear regression model using FEV as the outcome, and all other variables as explanatory variables.  What is the estimated smoking effect adjusted for all other variables?  NOTE: One should not simply adjust for all variables just because.  In the next course, we discuss methods for deciding which variables we should adjust for.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (g) (On-Paper) BONUS: $EBOLD Try a sub-group analysis, where you compare the FEV of smokers and non-smokers, for specific age/genders, etc.  What conclusions do you reach here?  HINT: You can view the YouTube Tutorial on "subsetting using square brackets" for help creating subsets of data.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (h) (On-Paper) $EBOLD Write a short summary (between half a page to one page) that explains what you've learned about this data set, and the relationship between Smoking and FEV.  Comment on anything you believe to be relevant.
