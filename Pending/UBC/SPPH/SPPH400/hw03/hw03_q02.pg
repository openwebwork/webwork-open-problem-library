Running ultra-marathons may result in high levels of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood, which is associated with certain adverse health conditions. Hoffman$BITALIC et al.$EITALIC (2012) report a study in which they measured CK levels in the blood of some finishers of a 161 km race in 2010. Read the first three pages of the article:

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
An observational study. Note that data were not gathered on all finishers of the race.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The data in the three groups are not independent, since the second and third are a subset of the first, and the third is a subset of the second.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Side-by-side boxplots would be best.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The P-value can be found in R using $BITALIC pf($F, 2, 325,lower.tail=TRUE) $EITALIC.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
If the P-value is less than 0.05, "Yes"; otherwise "No".
$BR
$BR
In fact, if the population of interest is simply the runners in the race who finished in under thirty hours, we know the answer since we have complete information and there is no need for statistical inference. Presumably though some runners refuse to have a blood test at the end of a race, and it is of interest to know in general whether such runners would have different characteristics than those who comply. The equipment for measuring the sodium level failed near the end of the completion time, and this is probably the main reason why runners without a sodium reading were faster on average.
