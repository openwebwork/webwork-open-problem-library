McBeans magazine recently published a news article about caffeine
consumption in universities that claims that 80$PERCENT of people at
universities drink coffee regularly. Moonbucks, a popular coffee chain, is
interested in opening a new store on UBC campus. After reading McBeans'
article, they will consider opening a store in UBC if more than 80% of the
people in UBC drink coffee regularly. A random sample of people from UBC
was taken, and it was found that 680 out of 810 survey participants
considered themselves as regular coffee drinkers. Does Moonbucks' survey
result provide sufficient evidence to support opening a store at UBC?
