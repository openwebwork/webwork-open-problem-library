Can certain biomarkers, such as omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin D levels, influence whether a person suffers serious psychological distress (SPD)? 
In a study of people in 36 Inuit communities in northern Canada, Skogli $BITALIC et al. $EITALIC (2017) measured various physiological biomarkers
on volunteers, including via blood samples levels of n-3 long-chain fatty acids (FA, recorded as a percentage of fasting red blood cell membrane
fatty acids). Previous studies had indicated an association between low levels of omega-3 fatty acids and certain negative health outcomes.
In addition, volunteers were asked to complete a psychometric survey known as the Kessler 6-item psychological distress questionnaire.
Scores on this survey (K6) range from 0 to 24, with a score of at least 13 indicating SPD. In total 1113 volunteers provided information, and
suppose their data are as provided in the file below. (\{ htmlLink($local_url, "Download the data here") \})

Explore the relationship between K6 score and FA level graphically. Fit a linear model linking the response variable to the explanatory variable. What percentage of variation in K6 scores is explained by FA level? Give your answer to two significant figures.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
$BR
There is no treatment applied to the volunteers and responses were recorded without intervention. The study is purely observational.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
$BR
The scatterplot below indicates some negative correlation between K6 score and FA level, though there is much noise. 
$BCENTER
$fig
$ECENTER
The linear model can be fitted with the R code $BBOLD lm1 <- lm(K6 ~ FA)$EBOLD. The R\(^2\) value (in percentage) can be obtained with $BBOLD 100*summary(lm1)${DOLLAR}r.squared$EBOLD, which is $answers[0]%. Hence we see only a low proportion of variation in the response \(K6\) is explained by the variable FA.
$BR


$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
$BR
This is the number of volunteers whose K6 value is greater than or equal to 13, which equals $answers[1].
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) $EBOLD
$BR
The model fitted is of the form
\[
\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i,
\]
where \(\pi_i\) is the probability of individual \(i\) suffering SPD, and where \(x_i\) is the individual's FA level. The estimated odds requested is 
\[
\frac{\hat{\pi}}{1-\hat{\pi}} = e^{\hat{\beta}_0 + 5\hat{\beta}_1} = e^{$b0 + $b1\times 5} = $answers[2].
\]
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) $EBOLD
$BR
Rearranging the model stated above, 
\[
\pi_i = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i)}}.
\]
Hence the estimated probability of having SPD if the FA level is 3% is 
\[
\hat{\pi} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-($b0 + $b1\times 3)}} = $answers[3].
\]
