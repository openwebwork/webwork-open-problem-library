How good are people at predicting how the value of a stock will change over thirty days? Are stock market professionals ("experts") better
at predicting than laypeople? Torngren and Montgomery (2004) conducted studies to explore how well individuals could predict the values of a set of stocks thirty days into the future. In one such study, predictions from 22 stock market experts were compared with those from 29 lay people. The percentage change over a thirty day period was measured for each stock predicted, along with the corresponding percentage changes predicted by the experts and laypeople. Suppose that the data from this study for a selection of stocks are as given in the file below. (\{ htmlLink($local_url, "Download the data here") \})

To explore whether there is a linear relationship between the actual percentage change and the predicted change across all individuals in the study, fit a linear model to the data. What percentage of variation in the predicted percentage price change is accounted for by the actual change? Give your answer to two decimal places.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
$BR
There is no treatment applied to the subjects and responses were recorded without intervention. The study is purely observational.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
$BR
The plot can be drawn with the R function $BBOLD plot $EBOLD:
$BR
$BBOLD
plot(Actual, Predicted, xlab="Actual percent change", ylab="Predicted percent change", col=status);
$BR
legend("topleft", c("Laypeople","Experts"), fill=c("black", "red"))
$EBOLD,
$BR
which generates the following scatter plot.
$BR
$BCENTER
$fig
$ECENTER
From this plot it is not possible to deduce whether there is any difference between the experts and laypeople. In this context it makes sense to consider the actual percentage change as the explanatory variable, noting that it is feasible that the actual change could influence the predictions but not vice versa.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
$BR
The regression model can be fitted with the R function $BBOLD lm1 <- lm(Predicted ~ Actual) $EBOLD.
The part of variation in the response accounted for by the model is the R\(^2\) statitic, which can be obtained with the R code $BBOLD 100*summary(lm1)${DOLLAR}r.squared$EBOLD, which is $answers[0]%.
$BR


$BR
$BBOLD Part (d) $EBOLD
$BR
The model fitted is of the form
\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \gamma z_i + \epsilon,
\]
$BR
where \(Y_i\) is the predicted change, \(x_i\) the actual change, and 
\(z_i = 1 \) for laypeople and \(z_i = 2\) for experts.
$BR
The R code to fit the model is $BBOLD lm2 <- lm(Predicted ~ Actual + Status)$EBOLD. Fitting such a model, the test statistic for \(H_0: \gamma=0 \) can be obtained with the R code $BBOLD summary(lm2)${DOLLAR}coef[3, 3]$EBOLD and P-value can be obtained with $BBOLD summary(lm2)${DOLLAR}coef[3, 4]$EBOLD, which is $answers[1].
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (e) $EBOLD
$BR
The model fitted is of the form
\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + (\gamma + \delta x_i) z_i + \epsilon.
\]
$BR
The R code to fit the model is $BBOLD lm3 <- lm(Predicted ~ Actual * Status)$EBOLD. Fitting such a model, the test statistic for \(H_0: \delta=0 \) can be obtained with the R code $BBOLD summary(lm3)${DOLLAR}coef[4, 3]$EBOLD and P-value can be obtained with $BBOLD summary(lm3)${DOLLAR}coef[4, 4]$EBOLD, which is $answers[2].
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part (f) $EBOLD
$BR
The expert predictions were on average closer to the actual changes than those of the laypeople. However, neither set of individuals had predictions that appear linearly related to the actual changes.
