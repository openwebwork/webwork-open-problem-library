BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
$BBOLD Part (a)  $EBOLD
Due to their nature (population counts in this case), the data are likely to have periodic components of unknown wavelengths. A time domain approach may not identify these features. (1 mark for any plausible rationale.)

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b)  $EBOLD
\The fifth frequency, \(f_{5}\) say, has the largest value. The
sixth, \(f_{6}\) is the third largest. (2 marks. In fact the plot is
somewhat misleading, so marks were awarded if either \(f_{10}\) or \(f_{12}\)
were selected as the frequency with the third largest component.)

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c)  $EBOLD
We have here
\[
f_{5}=0.05\dot{5} 
\]
which suggests a wavelength of 18 time units, i.e., 36 days. 

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (d)  $EBOLD
The third most contributing frequency \(f_6\) ; is almost certainly due to leakage, with the actual main frequency being somewhere between \(f_5\) and \(f_6\). (If \(f_{10}\) or \(f_{12}\) chosen in (b): Being a multiple (double) of the main frequency component, \(f_{10}\) [\(f_{12}\)] is likely a harmonic, due to the periodic component not being exactly sinusoidal.) 

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (e)  $EBOLD
At a given frequency \(\omega\) say, the periodogram I(\(\omega\)) does not have a variance that decreases as N increases. (1 mark) For N observations, there are N/2 values of the sample periodogram to calculate, and this number increases with N. Moreover, the values are mutually independent. Each value of the periodogram behaves like a \(\chi^2\) variable, with variance independent of N, being a regression SS. Hence as N increases there are increasing number of uncorrelated values, each of constant variance. 

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (f)  $EBOLD
We modify the periodogram at a particular frequency \(\omega\) by defining 
\[
\hat{f}(\omega) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_jI(\omega_j)
\]
where \(j\) ranges over \(m\) consecutive integers so that {\(\omega_j\)} are symmetric about \(\omega\).


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (g)  $EBOLD
Plot (ii) is probably best, being neither over-nor under-smoothed. A case could be made for (iii) as well, which was also accepted.

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (h)  $EBOLD
We know the smoothed estimate \(\hat{f}_S\) with \(2m = n\), satisfies
\[
\frac{n\hat{f}_S(\omega)}{f(\omega)} = \chi^2_n
\]
approximately, and so here
\[
\frac{16\hat{f}_S(\omega)}{f(\omega)} = \chi^2_{16}.
\]
A 95% confidence interval is therefore
\[
\Big( \frac{16\hat{f}_S(\omega)}{\chi^2_{16}(0.975)} , \frac{16\hat{f}_S(\omega)}{\chi^2_{16}(0.025)} \Big) = (3.3157 \times 10^6, 1.3848 \times 10^7). 
 \]
