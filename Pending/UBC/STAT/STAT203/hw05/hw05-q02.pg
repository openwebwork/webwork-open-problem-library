BEGIN_TEXT
A physics student wants to measure the stiffness of a spring (force required per cm stretched). He knows that according to Hooke's law, there is a linear relationship between the distance a spring is stretched and the force needed to stretch the spring. He collects some data by measuring the force applied to the spring when he stretches the spring by some amount. The plot and the least squares fit is given below.
