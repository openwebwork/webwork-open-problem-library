BEGIN_TEXT
An epidemiologist is worried about the prevalence of the flu in East Vancouver and the potential shortage of vaccines for the area. She will need to provide a recommendation for how to allocate the vaccines appropriately across the city. She takes a simple random sample of $n people living in East Vancouver and finds that $num have recently had the flu. 

$PAR
For each of the following statements, specify whether the statement is a correct interpretation of the 95$PERCENT confidence interval for the true proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu.

$PAR
$BBOLD A. $EBOLD
$phat$PERCENT ($num/$n) of East Vancouver residents have recently had the flu.
\{ $popup_a->menu() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD B. $EBOLD
There is a 95$PERCENT probability that the true proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu equals $num/$n.
\{ $popup_b->menu() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD C. $EBOLD
If another random sample of $n East Vancouver residents is drawn, there is a 95$PERCENT probability that the sample proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu equals $num/$n.
\{ $popup_c->menu() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD D. $EBOLD
If many random samples of $n East Vancouver residents are drawn, 95$PERCENT of the resulting confidence intervals will contain the value of the true proportion of East Vancouver residents who have recently had the flu.  
\{ $popup_d->menu() \}


$PAR
$BBOLD E. $EBOLD
If many random samples of $n East Vancouver residents are drawn, 95$PERCENT of the resulting confidence intervals will contain the value $num/$n.
\{ $popup_e->menu() \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) We cannot equate the sample proportion with the
population proportion. (b) The population proportion is a parameter, and
probability statements such as the one given do not make sense. (c) The
sample proportion is a random variable, but it does not have 95% of its
probability distribution on the observed value. (d) This is the correct
interpretation of the confidence interval. (e) It is not known whether the
observed sample proportion is equal to the true population proportion.
