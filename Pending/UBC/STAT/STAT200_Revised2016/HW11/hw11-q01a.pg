BlueSky Air claims that at least 80$PERCENT of its flights arrive on time. A random sample of @nR[0] BlueSky Air flights revealed that @mR[0] arrive on time. Do the data provide sufficient evidence to contradict the claim by BlueSky Air? (i.e., you would like to see whether the percentage of the airlines flights on time is below what the airline claims)?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameter is the population proportion of all BlueSky flights arriving on time. 
$BR
$BR
(b) The claim of the company is not sensibly
negated by a higher proportion of flights than claimed arriving on time.
Hence a one-sided alternative is reasonable.
$BR
$BR
(c) Under the null hypothesis that \(p=0.8,\) the sample
proportion should approximately follow the Normal distribution with mean \(
0.8 \) and standard deviation \( \sqrt{0.8\left( 1-0.8\right) /@nR[0]}
=@sdR[0]. \) To find the P-value we seek the probability of observing a sample
proportion \(\hat{p}\) at least as low as the value @phatR[0] recorded, this
being approximately
$BR
$BR
\begin{eqnarray*}
P\left( \hat{p}\leq @phatR[0] \right)  &=& P\left( \frac{\hat{p}-0.8}{
\sqrt{0.8\left( 1-0.8\right) /@nR[0]}} \leq \frac{@phatR[0]-0.8}{
\sqrt{0.8\left( 1-0.8\right) /@nR[0]}}\right)  \\
&=&P\left( Z\leq \frac{@phatR[0]-0.8}{\sqrt{0.8\left( 1-0.8\right) /
@nR[0]}}\right) ,
\end{eqnarray*}
$BR
$BR
where \(Z\) denotes a standard Normal variable. Via tables or
software, we find the P-value is @pvalR[0].

$BR
$BR
(d) If BlueSky's claim is true, there is a probability @pvalR[0]
that in a random sample of @nR[0] flights, @mR[0] or fewer flights arrive on
time. The low value of this P-value suggests that the observed proportion of
flights on time is rather low if BlueSky's claim is correct.
$BR
$BR
(e) Since the P-value is lower than 5 %, we reject the null hypothesis at the 5 % significant level. Rejecting the null hypothesis does not prove the claim is false, but does provide strong evidence against it.
$BR
$BR
(f) A type I error occurs when a null hypothesis that is true is
rejected by the test.
$BR
$BR
(g) As the null hypothesis is rejected, we are only in danger of
making a type I error. Type II errors occurs when a null hypothesis that is false is not rejected.
