## Main Text: where all text goes (Required)

BEGIN_TEXT
 In 2006, 9.1% of the Canadian population reported speaking both
English and a language other than French at home (according to
http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/assa/98-314-x/98-314-x2011001-eng.cfm). Statistics Canada reports that the number has increased since then.
Suppose, hypothetically, that they use as evidence a sample survey of @n[0]
households in 2015 that shows that @m[0] of them report this kind of
bilingualism.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The proportion of all Canadians speaking both English
and a language other than French at home is the parameter of interest. 
$BR
$BR

(b) The null hypothesis is that the proportion of all Canadians
speaking both English and a language other than French at home equals 0.091,
the value previously found. 
$BR
$BR

(c) As it is suggested that the proportion has risen, the alternative
hypothesis is that the proportion of Canadians speaking both English and a
language other than French at home is greater than 0.091.
$BR
$BR

(d) Under the hypothesis the population proportion \(\pi\) is 0.091,
the sample proportion will be approximately Normal with mean 0.091 and
standard deviation
\[
\sqrt{\pi \left( 1-\pi \right) /1000}=\sqrt{0.091\times 0.909/1000}.
\]
$BR
$BR

(e) The z-score here is the standardised value of the sample
proportion, this being
\[
\frac{@phat[0]-0.091}{\sqrt{0.091\times 0.909/1000}}=@s5[0].
\]
$BR
$BR

(f) This is a one--sided test, with alternative hypothesis that \(\pi
>0.091.\) Hence high values of the sample proportion lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis, and the P-value is found by finding the
probability to the right of @phat[0] via the model in (d). By
software or tables, this is @s6[0]. 
$BR
$BR

(g) There is evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 5%
significance level, and so we can conclude that there is evidence to support
that the proportion of Canadians speaking both English and a language other
than French at home is significantly higher than 0.091.
