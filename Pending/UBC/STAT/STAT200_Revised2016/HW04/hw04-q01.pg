BEGIN_TEXT

A researcher is conducting a study on Parkinson's disease. For the 100 patients he interviews, he records their gender, annual income, occupation and weight. He finds that 50$PERCENT of the interviewed subjects who have Parkinson's disease work in the service industry, and concluded that working in the service industry causes one's chance of getting Parkinson's disease to increase. Which of the following statements is/are correct about the researcher's claim?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
Without additional information (in this case, for
example, a plausible reason why working in a service industry could cause
Parkinson's) we cannot conclude causality from an observational study. There
is no information given as to whether 50% is a high proportion within the
general population. That is, it could be that 50% of all workers in the
population are in the "service industry".
