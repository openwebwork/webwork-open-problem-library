BEGIN_TEXT
The time taken for healthy Canadian adults to complete a logic problem
is believed to have a mean 40 seconds. It is of interest to investigate whether
UBC students perform better on average than healthy adult Canadians,
so the logic problem is given to a sample of 80 UBC students, and
their times to solution are recorded. The sample mean and standard deviation are @xbarR[0] seconds and @sdR[0] seconds.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameters of concern relate to a population of
interest, not to the data collected. 
$BR
$BR

(b) The null hypothesis asserts a default value on a parameter of
interest, the default value in this case being the mean time for healthy
Canadian adults which is given as 40 secs.
$BR
$BR

(c) It is suggested that UBC students may perform better on average
than the Canadian adult population, suggesting a one-sided, left-tailed
alternative. That is, we test \(H_{0}:\mu =40\) against \( H_{A}:\mu <40,
\) where \(\mu \) is the mean time to solve the problem for UBC
students.
$BR
$BR
(d) A t-test is appropriate, so the test statistic is
\[
\frac{\bar{x}-\mu }{s/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{@xbarR[0]-40}{@sdR[0]/\sqrt{80}}
=@tstatR[0].
\]
$BR
$BR

(e) A t distribution is appropriate since the population standard
deviation is unknown. In fact we should compare with the t distribution on
79 degrees of freedom. 
$BR
$BR


(f) If we reject the null hypothesis, there is evidence that UBC
students over average solve problem quicker than healthy Canadian adults.
$BR
$BR

(g) In rejecting the null hypothesis, it is possible a type I error is
being made.
$BR
$BR

(h) The relatively low P-value tells us that if indeed the mean time
to solve the problem for UBC students is 40 secs, the sample of UBC students
performed appreciably better than this average.
