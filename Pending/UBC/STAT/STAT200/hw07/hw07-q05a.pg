Refer to the following scenario.
$PAR
A government official is in charge of allocating social programs throughout the city of Vancouver.  
He will decide where these social outreach programs should be located based on the percentage 
of residents living below the poverty line in each region of the city.  He takes a simple random 
sample of $n people living in Gastown and finds that $num have an annual income that is below 
the poverty line. 
$PAR
The government official will choose Gastown as a location for one of the social outreach programs if his sample data provide sufficient evidence to support that the true proportion of people living below poverty line is greater than $pnull.  A test of hypothesis is conducted.
