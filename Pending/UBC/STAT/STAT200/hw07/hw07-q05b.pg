$PAR
Refer to the following scenario.
$PAR
An epidemiologist is worried about the prevalence of the flu in East Vancouver and the potential shortage of vaccines for the area. She will need to provide a recommendation for how to allocate the vaccines appropriately across the city. She takes a simple random sample of $n people living in East Vancouver and finds that $num have recently had the flu.
$PAR
The epidemiologist will recommend East Vancouver as a location for one of the vaccination programs if her sample data provide sufficient evidence to support that the true proportion of people who have recently had the flu is greater than $pnull.  A test of hypothesis is conducted.
