Prospective drivers who enrol in Smart Driver Driving School have always been taught by a conventional teaching method.  The driving school has many branches across provinces. Last year, among all students that took driving lessons from the school in a certain province, 80$PERCENT passed the provincial road test. This year, the teaching committee came up with a new teaching method. The committee randomly assigned half of its 2400 students enrolled this year to receive the conventional teaching method and the remaining half to receive the new teaching method. In a random sample of 100 students who received the conventional teaching method, $nconven$PERCENT passed the road test.
