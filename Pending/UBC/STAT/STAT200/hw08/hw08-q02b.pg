A report says that 82$PERCENT of British Columbians over the age of 25 are high school graduates. A survey of randomly selected residents of a certain city included 1290 who were over the age of 25, and 1135 of them were high school graduates. Does the cityâ€™s survey result provide sufficient evidence to contradict the reported value, 82$PERCENT?
