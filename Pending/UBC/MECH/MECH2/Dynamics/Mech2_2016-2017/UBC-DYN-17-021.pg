$PAR
A uniform slender rod with the length of \($L\) \(m\) is pivoted at point \(O\). The distance between the right end of the rod and the pivoted point \(O\) is \($X\) \(m\). When the rod is released from the rest in the horizontal position shown in the figure and rotates around the point \(O\), determine the following parameters at the moment which the rod passes the vertical position. $PAR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 1. Mass moment of inertia around the point \(O\), \(I_O\) $BR

$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 4. Also, calculate the distance \(X\) which the rod can have the maximum angular velocity as the rod passes the vertical position, then determine the maximum angular velocity (\(X\) is less than half of the rod length) $BR
