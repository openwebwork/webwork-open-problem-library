An inverted pendulum is mounted on a cart at point [`O`] with a torsional spring and the system is moving with a constant acceleration of [`a = [$a]`] [`m/s^2`]. While the cart is moving, the angle between the vertical axis and the pendulum is constant and is [`\theta = [$theta]^{\circ}`]. The rod has a mass of [`2m`], and the ball has a mass of [`m`]. Assume that the torsional spring is undeformed when the rod is positioned vertically. Use the following values to find the spring constant, [`K`]. 
	[`\cdot`] [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`]  
	[`\cdot`] [`l = [$l]`] [`m`]

[`K = `][____]{"$K"} [`N\cdot m/rad`]
