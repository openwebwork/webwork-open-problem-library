The front wheel drive vehicle shown in the figure below has tracks on each side and is designed to be used on surfaces covered with snow. Assume that the vehicle starts from restm moves with a constant acceleration and reaches a velocity [`v = [$V]`] [`m/s`] after traveling [`[$s]`] [`m`]. Use the following assumptions and calculate the portion of torque required to accelerate the two tracks to achieve the abovementioned velocity.  
	[`\cdot`] Mass per unit length of the track [`\rho = [$rho]`] [`kg/m`]  
	[`\cdot`] The distance between the wheels is [`b = [$d]`] [`m`]  
	[`\cdot`] Radius of the wheel is [`r = [$r]`] [`m`]  

[`M = `][____]{"$M"} [`Nm`]
