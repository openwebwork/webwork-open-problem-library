An ancient structure shaped like a cone with a base diameter [`D = [$BaseDia]`] [`m`], height [`H = [$ConeHeight]`] [`m`], and mass equal to [`[$Mass]`] [`kg`] is being lifted to the ocean surface using a marine crane. The orientation of the conical structure as it is being lifted is shown in the figure. When the bottom surface of the artifact is at a depth of [`[$Depth]`] [`km`], determine the average normal stress along a cross-section located at [`y = [$CrossSectDist]`] [`m`] from the bottom surface. Assume that tension is positive, and compression is negative. The density of oceanwater at large depths is [`1028`] [`kg/m^3`].
