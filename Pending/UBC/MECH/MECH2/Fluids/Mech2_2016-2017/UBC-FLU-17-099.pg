BEGIN_PGML 
Suppose the pump (with its system and performance curve shown in the figure below) is situated between two water tanks with their free surfaces open to the atmosphere. Which free surface is at a higher elevation the one corresponding to the tank supplying water to the pump inlet, or the one corresponding to the tank connected to the pump outlet?
