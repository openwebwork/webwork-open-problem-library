A water pump is used to pump water from one large reservoir to another large reservoir [`[$delta_z]`] [`m`] above it. The free surfaces of both reservoirs are exposed to atmospheric pressure, as sketched in the figure. The pump's performance is approximated by the expression [`H_{available} = H_0 - a (dV/dt)^2`], where the shutoff head [`H_0 = [a]`] [`m`] of water column, coefficient [`a = [b]`] [`m/(Lpm)^2`], available pump head [`H_{available}`] is in units of meters of water column, and capacity [`(dV/dt)`] is in units of liters per minute ([`Lpm`]). Estimate the capacity delivered by the pump.  Use the turbulent pipe flow friction factor equation given on the MECH 222F Formula Sheet. Assume [`L = [$L]`] [`m`], [`D = [$D*100]`] [`cm`], total minor losses, [`k = [$k]`], roughness, [`\epsilon=[$eps]`], and a laminar flow with [`U = [$U]`] [`m/s`].
