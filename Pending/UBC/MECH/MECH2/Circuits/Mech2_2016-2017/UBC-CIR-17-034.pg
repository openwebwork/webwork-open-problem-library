BEGIN_TEXT
The figure shows an RC circuit with a voltage source as its input and with two switches to connect and disconnect the voltage. Both switches are initially open. The switch \(1\) is then closed at time t = 0, connecting the battery to the RC circuit, while switch \(2\) remains open. Now assume that time \(t = T\), switch \(1\) is opened and switch \(2\) is closed. If \(T\) is very large, what is the voltage across the capacitor as a function of time for \(t > T\)? (Hint: start by writing KVL around the circuit.)
