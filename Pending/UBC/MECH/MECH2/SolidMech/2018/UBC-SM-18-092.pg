A rigid bar [`ABCD`] is pinned at end [`A`] and supported by two cables at points [`B`] and [`C`]. The cable at [`B`] has nominal diameter [`d_B = [$db]`] [`mm`] and the cable at [`C`] has nominal diameter [`d_C = [$dc]`] [`mm`]. A load [`P`] acts at end [`D`] of the bar.

What is the allowable load [`P`] if the temperature rises by [`[$dt]^{\circ}C`] and each cable is required to have a factor of safety of at least [`[$sf]`] against its ultimate load?
(Note: The cables have effective modulus of elasticity [`E = [$e]`] [`GPa`] and coefficient of thermal expansion [`\alpha = [$alpha] \times 10^{-6}/^{\circ}C`]. Other properties of the cables can be found in Table 2-1, Section 2_2.)
