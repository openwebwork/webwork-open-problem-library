BEGIN_TEXT

Assume that one wanted to use least squares to fit a polynomial function to a set of data. The polynomial is of order \($n\) - that is, it is of the form \(y(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_$n x^$n\). If there are \($m\) sets of \((x, y)\) measurements, how many more equations than unknowns would there be if one tried to solve for each of the coefficients \(a_i\) directly (without least squares).
