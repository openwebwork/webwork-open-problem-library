$PAR
Determine if the following statements are False or True. 
$PAR
$BBOLD You only have two trials $EBOLD

$PAR
a) Reynolds number (\(Re\)) is a dimensionless number, showing the relative magnitude of inertial forces compared to viscous forces   \{ $A->menu() \}  $BR

b) Laminar flows are highly ordered, while turbulent flows are choatic, random with large amount of mixing. \{ $B->menu() \}  $BR

c) For large enough values of Reynolds number, the flow on a flat plate or around an object becomes turbulent.  \{ $C->menu() \}  $BR

d) The ratio of thickness of thermal boundary layer to flow boundary layer is governed by Prandtl number (\(Pr\)). \{ $D->menu() \} $BR

e) The role of thermal diffusivty (\(\alpha\)) in heat transport by conduction in similar to the role \{ $E->menu() \} of for momentum transport due to viscous forces. $BR

f) For liquid metals, \(Pr \ll 1\). That means the thermal boundary layer thickness for such liquids is \{ $F->menu() \} the hydraulic boundary layer thickness. $BR
