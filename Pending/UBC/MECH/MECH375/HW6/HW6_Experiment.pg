$PAR
An object with surface area \(A=$A\) m\(^2\) and volume of \(V=$V\) m\(^3\) is placed in a cross flow. 
In order to estimate the value of convection heat transfer coefficient for this object, we run two sets of experiments and following results are registered:
$PAR
EXPERIMENT 1: When \(U_1 = $U1\) m/s, we find \(\bar{h}_1 = $h1 \) W/m\(^2\).K.
$PAR
EXPERIMENT 2: When \(U_2 = $U2\) m/s, we find \(\bar{h}_2 = $h2 \) W/m\(^2\).K.
$PAR

Assume the following form of correlation is suggested:
\( Nu = CRe^m Pr^n \), where \(C, m\) and \(n\) are constants. 

$PAR
a) What is a relevant length scale for this object? \(L_c=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} m. $BR
$PAR
b) Re-write the above correlation in the form of \( h = \Psi U^m\). Can you tell what parameters are encapsulated in \(\Psi\)? 
$PAR
Using the experimental data you have available, find the value of \(\Psi\) and \(m\) $BR $PAR
\(\Psi=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}  W/m\(^2\).K / (m/s)\(^m\) and  \(m=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$PAR
c)Use this to evaluate \( h \) when \(U_3 = $U3\) m/s. \(h_3=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\).K. $BR
$PAR
d) Compute the rate of convection heat transfer when the temperature of the object is \($dT^\circ\)C warmer than the sorrounding air. 
\(q_3=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W. $BR

$PAR
 a) \[  L_c = \frac{V}{A} = \frac{$V}{$A} \]
$PAR
 b) We know \(h_1 = \Psi U_1^m\) and \(h_2 = \Psi U_2^m\), therefore, \[ \frac{h_1}{h_2} = \left(\frac{U_1}{U_2}\right)^m \Rightarrow m= \frac{\ln\frac{h2}{h1}}{\ln\frac{U2}{U1}} = $b \]
$PAR

$PAR
\[  \Psi= \frac{h}{U^{m}} = \frac{$h1}{$U1^{$b}} = $a \]
$PAR

$PAR
c) \[  h_3= \Psi U_3^{m} = $a($U3)^{$b} = $h3  \]
