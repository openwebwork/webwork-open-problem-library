$PAR
A flat plate $L m \(\times\)$W m is place in an air flow with temperature $Tair \(^\circ\)C and speed of $U m/s. The flow is parallel to the larger side of the plate.
The drag force exerted on the plate is measured to be $Fd N.  The air properties can be taken as
\(k=$k\) W/m.K, \(\rho=$rho\) kg/m\(^3\), \(c_p = $cp\) J/kg.K and \(\mu = $mu \times 10^{-6}\) Pa.s. 
$PAR

a) What is the surface area exposed to the flow? \(A_s=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}. m\(^2\). $BR

b) Calculate the friction coefficient \(C_f=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}. $BR

c) Compute the average heat transfer coefficient \(h_{ave}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\).K. $BR

### SOLUTION


BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
a) 
\( A_s = 2L W = 2($L)($W) = $As\) m\(^2\)
$PAR
b) 
\( C_f = \frac{\tau}{0.5\rho U^{2}} = \frac{F_d}{0.5\rho A_s U^{2}} = \frac{$Fd}{\left(($rho)($As)($U^{2})(0.5)\right)} = $Cf  \)
$PAR
c) 
Chilton-Colburn Analogy
\( \frac{C_f}{2} = St Pr^{\frac{2}{3}}  \)
$PAR
We calculate \( Pr = \frac{c_p \mu}{k} =  \frac{($cp)*($mu \times10^{-6})}{$k} = $Pr \)
$PAR
\[ St = \frac{h}{\rho U c_p} = \frac{\frac{C_f}{2}}{Pr^{\frac{2}{3}}}  \]
\( h = \rho U C_p St  \)
$PAR
Replace \(St\) in the above equation, \( h = \rho U c_p \frac{\frac{C_f}{2}}{Pr^{\frac{2}{3}}} = \frac{($Cf)($rho)($U)($cp)}{(2)($Pr^{2/3})} = $h\) W/m\(^2\).K.
