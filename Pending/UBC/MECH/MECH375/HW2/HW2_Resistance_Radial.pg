$PAR
Steam at an average temperature of \(T=\) $T1 \(^\circ\)C flows in a stainless steel pipe with inner and outer diameter of \(D_i=\) $Di cm and \(D_o=\) $Do cm and conductivity of \(k_{ss}=\) $kss  W/m.K. To reduce heat loss, the pipe is insulated with a $L-cm thick glass wool insulation with conductivity of \(k_{gw}=\) $kgw  W/m.K. The convection heat transfer coefficient inside the pipe is estimated to be \(h_{i} =\) $hi W/m\(^2\).K. The insulating material fails if it experiences a temperature larger than \(T_{cr}=\) $T2 \(^\circ\)C. The goal is to find the necessary convection heat transfer coefficient provided by air at \(T_{\infty} = \) $T3 \(^\circ\)C outside the pipe (\(h_{o}\) ) that ensures the insulating material remains safe.  
$PAR
Assuming that we define the thermal resistance based on heat rate per unit length; i.e.  \( R' = \frac{\Delta T}{q'}\),
$PAR
a) Find the resistance due to convection inside the pipe \(R'_1= \)\{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C.m/W $BR

b) Find the resistance due to conduction in the pipe \(R'_2= \) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C.m/W $BR

c) Find the resistance due to conduction in the glass layer \(R'_3= \) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C.m/W $BR

d) Write the energy balance before and after \(T_{cr}\) to obtain the resistance per unit length due to convection outside the insulation \(R'_4= \) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C/mW $BR

e) Using \(R'_4\),  \{ $minmax->menu() \} value of \(h_o\) that ensures the insulator will safely operate is \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\)K

BEGIN_SOLUTION
\(R'_1 = \frac{1}{h_i\pi D_i} = \frac{1}{$hi\pi($Di\times 10^{-2})} = $R1~^\circ\)C/W.m. 
$PAR
\(R'_2 = \frac{\ln r_2/r_1}{2\pi k_{ss}} = \frac{\ln $Do/$Di }{2\pi($kss)} = $R2~^\circ\)C/W.m.
$PAR
\(R'_3 = \frac{\ln r_3/r_2}{2\pi k_{gw}} = \frac{\ln \left[($Do+2\times$L)/$Do\right] }{2\pi($kgw)} = $R3~^\circ\)C/W.m.
$PAR
If we write the energy balance:
\( \frac{T_{cr} - T_\infty}{R'_3 + R'_4} = \frac{T_{steam}- T_{cr}}{R'_1+R'_2} \Rightarrow R'_4 = \frac{T_\infty-T_{cr}}{T_{cr}-T_{steam}}\left(R'_1 + R'_2\right) - R'_3\)
$PAR
This leads to \(R'_4 = $R4~^\circ\)C/W.m. Therefore
$PAR
\(R'_4 = \frac{1}{h_o\pi (D_o+2L)} \Rightarrow h_o =  \frac{1}{R'_4 \pi(D_o+2L)} \Rightarrow h_o = $ho\) W/m\(^2\).K.; (\(L\) is the thickness of insulation layer \(= $L\) cm).
