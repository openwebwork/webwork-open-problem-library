### SOLUTION
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
a)
From left to write, we get constant temperature at the wall, constant heat flux (gradient of temperature) at the wall, no flux at the wall and finally convection at the wall
$PAR
b) The slope of temperature in material Y is larger than that in material X. Therefore, \(k_X > k_Y\). 
The slope of temperature in material X is constant , so is its conductivity.
The slope of temperature drops in material Y, so its conductivity is increasing.
