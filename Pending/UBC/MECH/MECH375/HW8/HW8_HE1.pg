A shell and tube heat exchanger is used to warm up water with hot oil. The thin-walled inner pipe has a diameter of \(D_i=\)$Di cm and the outer shell has a diameter of \(D_o =\) $Do cm. Water flows in the inner tube at mass flow rate of \(\dot{m}_{water}=\)$mdot1 kg/s while oil flows in the outer shell at the mass flow of \(\dot{m}_{oil}=\) $mdot2 kg/s, as shown above. The water inlet and outlet temperature is \({T_{i,water}}=$T1^\circ\)C and \({T_{o,water}}=$T2^\circ\)C. The oil inlet temperature is \({T_{i,oil}}=$T3^\circ\)C. The goal is to find how long the heat exchanger has to be.

For the sake of simplicity assume the water and oil properties are constant and given by

Water: \(\rho=$rho1\) kg/m\(^3\), \(c_p =$cp1\) J/kg.K, \(\mu = $mu1 \) Pa.s, \(k = $k1 \) W/m.K and \(Pr = $Pr1\). 
$PAR
Oil: \(\rho=$rho2\) kg/m\(^3\), \(c_p =$cp2\) J/kg.K, \(\mu = $mu2 \) Pa.s and \(k = $k2 \) W/m.K.
$PAR
Also assume the heat exchanger is well insulated and no heat can escape the shell.
