An old shell and tube heat exchanger is considered to be redesigned. As part of the process, some estimate of fouling factor \(R_f\) is necessary.
The heat exchanger is $L-m long and is made of inner tube with inner and outer diameters of $Di1 cm and $Do1 cm and outer shell with inner diameter of $Di2 cm. Hot vapor flows on the outer side, while water flows on the inner side. 
The inner and outer side convection heat transfer coefficients are estimated to be \(h_i=\) $h1 W/m\(^2\).K and  \(h_o=\)$h2 W/m\(^2\).K, respectively. 
Based on the inner and outer temperature reads on the inner side, the inner overal 
heat transfer coefficients is estimated as \(U_i=\) $U1 W/m\(^2\).K. 
The heat exchanger is made from stainless steel with conductivity of \(k_{ss} =\) $k W/m.K.

$PAR
a) Which side is more likely to develop fouling resistance? \{ $A->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
b) find the thermal resistance due to the convection on the inner side \(R_{i,conv}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} K/W  $BR
$PAR
c) find the thermal resistance due to the convection on the outer side \(R_{o,conv}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} K/W $BR
$PAR
d) find the thermal resistance due to the conduction in the inner pipe \(R_{cond}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} K/W  $BR
$PAR
e) Using the overal heat transfer on the inner side, find the total thermal resistance \(R_{tot}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} K/W  $BR
$PAR
f) Considering the fouling is only significant at one side (as chosen in part a)), 
use part b-e to determine the fouling factor \(R''_{f} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} m\(^2\).K/W. $BR
