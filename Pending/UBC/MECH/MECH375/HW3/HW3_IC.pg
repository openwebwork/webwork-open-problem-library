BEGIN_TEXT

An $a\(\times\)$a cm\(^2\) IC board shall be kept at $T1 \(^\circ\)C or lower in order to operate properly. From one side, the board is exposed to air at $T2 \(^\circ\)C that provides convection heat transfer with coefficient \(h=\) $h W/m\(^2\).K. To enhance heat transfer, $n square fins, $b\(\times\)$b mm\(^2\), made from a material with conductivity of \(k_{fin}=\) $k W/m.K, are install on the board. The fins are $H cm tall (assume they are tall enough that the tips are adiabatic).

$PAR
a) What is the efficiency of one fin? \(\eta_f =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

b) What is the total surface area and total heat transfer from the finned area? \(A_{fin} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} and  \(q_{fin} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}$BR

c) What is the total surface area and total heat transfer from the unfinned area? \(A_{unfin} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\} and  \(q_{unfin} =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}$BR

d) What is the ratio of heat transfer from the finned area over heat transfer from the unfinned area?  \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
