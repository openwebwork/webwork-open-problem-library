BEGIN_TEXT

Temperature of a hot water stream is to be measured with a thermocouple. 
The tip of thermocouple can be approximated with a sphere of diameter \(D=$D\) mm 
and is made of a material with \(\rho= $rho\)kg/m\(^3\), \(k=$k\)W/m.K and
\(c=$cp\) J/kg.K. The convection heat transfer coefficient is estimated to be \(h=$h\) W/m\(^2\).K. 

$PAR
a) Compute the Biot numberto check if Lumped Parameter Approach (LPA) is valid. \(Bi=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} s $BR

b) Is LPA valid? \{ $A->menu() \}  $BR

c) How long do we need to wait until we ensure the thermocouple reading error is less than 1%. $BR

$PAR
\(t=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} s $BR

# Tell WeBWork how to test if answers are right.  These should come in the

BEGIN_SOLUTION
We first check if LPA is valid. Remember characteristics length here is \(r_0/3\).
$PAR
\( Bi = \frac{hL_c}{k} = \frac{hD}{6k} = \frac{$h\times $D2}{6\times $k} = $Bi\)
Since \( Bi << 1\), LPA is valid. 
$PAR
\( \tau = \frac{\rho V c}{hA_s} = \frac{\rho c D}{6h} = \frac{$rho\times $cp \times $D2}{6\times $h} = $tau\) s
$PAR
and 
$PAR
\( \frac{T- T_i}{T_\infty - T_i} = exp(-t/\tau) \Rightarrow t = -\tau \ln\left(\frac{T- T_i}{T_\infty - T_i}\right) = -($tau)\times \ln\left(0.001\right) = $time \) s.
