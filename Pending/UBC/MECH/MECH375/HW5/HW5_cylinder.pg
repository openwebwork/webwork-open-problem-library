A large cylinder with diameter \(D=$D\) cm is at uniform temperature of \(T_i=$Ti^\circ\)C. A fan that blows
air at temperature \(T_{inf}=$Tair^\circ\)C to cool the cylinder down. 
The convection coefficient is estimated to be \(h=$h\)W/m\(^2\).K. 
The safe temperature for handling is \(T_{safe}=$To^\circ\)C. The properties of the cylinder are \(\rho = $rho\) kg/m\(^3\), \(c=$cp\) J/kg.K
and \(k=$k\) W/m.K. A conservative measure imposes that the entire object has to reach to the safe temperature. 

$PAR
a) Compute the Biot number to check if LPA is valid. \(Bi=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}  $BR

b) Is LPA valid? \{ $A->menu() \}  $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

First check if LPA is valid. Remember the characteristics length is half radius.
$PAR
\(Bi = \frac{h r_0/2}{k} = \frac{$h\times $D2/4}{$k} = $Bi1\)
$PAR
LPA is not valid. so let assume 1-term approximation works. We'll check this assumption later
$PAR
\(\frac{T- T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_\infty} = C_1 exp(-\xi_1^2 Fo) J_0(\xi_1 r/r_0) \) 
$PAR
The Biot number changes here.
\( Bi = \frac{hr_0}{k} = $Bi \)
$PAR
With \(Bi = $Bi\), we read the \(C_1=$C1\) and \(\xi_1=$xi\) from the table. 
$PAR
We need to design this for \(x=0\), because that would the last place that reaches the desired temperature. Therefore, (notice that \(J_0(0) = 1\) )
$PAR 
\(\frac{$To-$Tair}{$Ti-$Tair} = $C1 exp\left(-($xi)^2 Fo\right) \Rightarrow Fo = $Fo \)
$PAR
Since \(Fo > 0.2\), the 1-term approximation was justified. Now lets calculate \(t\):
$PAR
\( \alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c} = \frac{$k}{$rho \times $cp} = $alpha \) m\(^2\).s 
$PAR
\(t = \frac{r_0^2 Fo}{\alpha} = \frac{($D2/2)^2 \times $Fo}{$alpha} = $time \) s.
