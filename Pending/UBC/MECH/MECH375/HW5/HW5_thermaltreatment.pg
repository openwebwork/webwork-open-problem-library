BEGIN_TEXT

Thermal treatment is a common way to enhance physical properties of steel. In particular, reheating and 
then cooling the steel make the material more durable. Such process however, requires accurate temperature profile control. 
A steel plate with thickness \(L=$L\) mm is initially at \(T_i= $Ti^\circ\)C and is placed in a gasfire furnace at temperature 
\(T_{furnace}=$Tf^\circ\)C. The convection coefficient inside the furnace is estimated to be \(h=$h\) W/m\(^2\).K. The recipe for 
thermal treatment of this steel requires the temperature of the plate to reach a minimum of \(T_{min}=$Tp^\circ\)C. 
$PAR
The properties of the steel plate are \(\rho=$rho\) kg/m\(^3\), \(c=$cp\) J/kg.K and \(k=$k\) W/m.K. 

$PAR
a) Compute the Biot number to check if LPA is valid. \(Bi=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} s $BR

b) Is LPA valid? \{ $A->menu() \}  $BR

c) How long should the plate be left in the furnace?

$PAR
\(t=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} s $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

First check if LPA is valid. Remember the characteristics length is half thickness.
$PAR
\(Bi = \frac{h L_c}{k} = \frac{$h\times $L \times 10^{-3}/2}{$k} = $Bi\)
$PAR
LPA is not valid. so let assume 1-term approximation works. We'll check this assumption later
$PAR
\(\frac{T- T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_\infty} = C_1 exp(\xi_1^2 Fo) \cos(\xi_1 x/L) \) 
$PAR
The Biot number does not change. With \(Bi = $Bi\), we read the \(C_1=$C1\) and \(\xi_1=$xi\) from the table. 
$PAR
We need to design this for \(x=0\), because that would the last place that reaches the desired temperature. Therefore,
$PAR 
\(\frac{$Tp-$Tf}{$Ti-$Tf} = $C1 exp\left(-($xi)^2 Fo\right) \Rightarrow Fo = $Fo \)
$PAR
Since \(Fo > 0.2\), the 1-term approximation was justified. Now lets calculate \(t\):
$PAR
\( \alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c} = \frac{$k}{$rho \times $cp} = $alpha \) m\(^2\).s 
$PAR
\(t = \frac{L_c^2 Fo}{\alpha} = \frac{($L\times 10^{-3}/2)^2 \times $Fo}{$alpha} = $time \) s.
