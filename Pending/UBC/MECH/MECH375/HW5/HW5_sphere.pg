A sphere with diameter \(D=$D\) mm is at uniform temperature of \(T_i=$Ti^\circ\)C. A fan that blows
air at temperature \(T_{inf}=$Tair^\circ\)C to cool the sphere down. 
The convection coefficient is estimated to be \(h=$h\)W/m\(^2\).K. The properties of the sphere are \(\rho = $rho\) kg/m\(^3\), \(c=$cp\) J/kg.K
and \(k=$k\) W/m.K. 

$PAR
a) Compute the Biot number to check if LPA is valid. \(Bi=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}  $BR

b) Is LPA valid? \{ $A->menu() \}  $BR

c) How long must the spheres remain exposed to the fan so that 75% of the thermal energy is removed i.e. \( Q/Q_0 = 0.75\)?

\(t=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} s $BR

d) Is using 1-term approximation valid? \{ $B->menu() \}  $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

First check if LPA is valid. Remember the characteristics length is one-third of radius.
$PAR
\(Bi = \frac{h r_0/3}{k} = \frac{$h\times $D2/6}{$k} = $Bi1\)
$PAR
LPA is not valid. so let assume 1-term approximation works. We'll check this assumption later:
$PAR
heat dissipated is given by
\( \frac{Q}{Q_0} = 1 - \frac{3C_1 exp(-\xi_1^2 Fo)}{\xi_1^3} \left( \sin \xi_1 - \xi_1 \cos \xi_1 \right) \)
$PAR
If 75% of energy is removed, then \( \frac{Q}{Q_0} = 0.75\). In order to go ahead we should fix the Biot number and then read \(C_1\) and \(\xi_1\):
$PAR
The Biot number changes here.
\( Bi = \frac{hr_0}{k} = $Bi \)
$PAR
With \(Bi = $Bi\), we read the \(C_1=$C1\) and \(\xi_1=$xi\) from the table. 
Susbtitute this
$PAR
\( 0.75 = 1 - \frac{3($C1) exp\left(-($xi)^2 Fo\right)}{($xi)^3} \left( \sin($xi) - $xi \cos($xi) \right) \Rightarrow\)
$PAR
\( Fo = $Fo\) 
$PAR
Since \(Fo > 0.2\), the 1-term approximation was justified. Now lets calculate \(t\):
$PAR
\( \alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c} = \frac{$k}{$rho \times $cp} = $alpha \) m\(^2\).s 
$PAR
\(t = \frac{r_0^2 Fo}{\alpha} = \frac{($D2/2)^2 \times $Fo}{$alpha} = $time \) s.
