In $city, BC, snow can last as long as $time months on the ground. A new piping system is needed and the designers are wondering
how deep the pipeline has to be in the ground, so that the water does not freeze (i.e. temperature remains above \(0^\circ\)C ). 
Imagine the ground temperature is initially at \(T_i=$Ti^\circ\)C and snow average temperature is \(T_{snow}=$Ts^\circ\)C
and soil properties are \(k=$k\) W/m.K and \(\alpha=$alpha \times 10^{-6}\) m\(^2\)/s. 

$PAR
a) What type of method do you think is suitable for this problem \{ $A->menu() \} $BR

b) How deep the pipe has to be built?  \(H=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} m $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The problem is clearly semi-infinite:
$PAR
\( \frac{T-T_s}{T_i-T_s} = erf\left( \frac{x}{2\sqrt{\alpha t}}\right)\)
$PAR
calculate time in seconds
\( t = $time(30)(24)(3600) = $t \) s. 
$PAR 
\( \frac{0-$Ti}{$Ts-$Ti}=0.5= erf\left( \frac{H}{2\sqrt{$alpha \times 10^{-6} \times $t}}\right) \rightarrow H =2 \sqrt{$alpha \times 10^{-6} \times $t}~erf^{-1}(0.5) = $H \) m.
