$PAR
Answer the following multiple choice questions. You only have two trials. 

$PAR
a) \{ $A1->menu() \} to external flows, the flow regime (laminar vs turbulent) in internal flows is governed by . \{ $A2->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
b) The hydraulic and thermal entry lengths in pipe flows is \{ $B->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
c) Pressure drop in turbulent pipe flows depends significantly on \{ $C->menu() \} $BR
$PAR
d) In natural convection, \{ $D1->menu() \} , and the flow is typically \{ $D2->menu() \}$BR
$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Solution:
$PAR
a) Similar - Reynolds number
$PAR
b) almost indepent of Re and Pr in turbulent flows
$PAR
c) Reynolds number and pipe roughness
$PAR
d) there is no imposed velocity - caused by the gradient of density, as a result temperature difference
