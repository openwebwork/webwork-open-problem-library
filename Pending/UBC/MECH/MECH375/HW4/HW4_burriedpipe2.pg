BEGIN_TEXT

Consider a $L-m long pipe with outer diameter $D cm that is carrying hot water and is burried $H m under ground. A $t-cm thick layer of glass wool (\(k_{gw} = $k2\)W/m.K) is wrapped around the pipe. The pipe outside temperature is $T2 \(^\circ\)C. Assume conductivity of soil is $k W/m.K and its average temperature is $T1 \(^\circ\)C.

$PAR
a) What is the thermal resistance due to the insulator?
\(R_{ins}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C/W $BR
$PAR
b) What is the thermal resistance due to 2D conduction in the soil?
\(R_{soil}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C/W  $BR

$PAR
c) What is the rate of heat transfer?
 
\(q=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W $BR
