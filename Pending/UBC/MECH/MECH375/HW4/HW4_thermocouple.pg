$PAR
A thin wire with conductivity of $k2 W/m.K and diameter $D mm is mounted on a large rock with conductivity $k W/m.K. The sorrounding air has a temperature $T \(^\circ\)C and the convection heat coefficient is $h W/m\(^2\).K. Due to some unknown reasons, the rock has a large temperature. We would like to measure the wire temperature at the joint \(T_j\) and use it to find the (average) temperature inside the rock \(T_O\). Because of thermal resistance at the base of the wire, the junction temperature \(T_j\) would differ from the rock temperature \(T_O\). Our goal is to estimate this difference. To do so, we may assume the wire is like a fin. 

$PAR
a) Which one of these three options better represents the thermal circuit of the system?
\{ $A->menu() \}  $BR

$PAR
b) What is the thermal resistance of the fin? (assume the fin is very long).
\(R_{fin}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C/W $BR
$PAR
c) What is the thermal resistance of the rock? 
(Hint: approximate the resistance to the heat transfer as a disk on a semi-infinite medium.)
\(R_{fin}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C/W $BR

d) What temperature does the thermocouple measure, when \(T_O= $T2^\circ\)C?

For infinite fins we have

The perimeter and cross sectional area of the fin are

\[ R_{block} = \frac{1}{k_b S}  \]
$PAR
The wire tip can be thought of as a disk on a semi-infinite medium, therefore \( S= 2D\)
$PAR
\( R_{block} = \frac{1}{$k*2*($D/1000)} =  $Rb~^\circ\)C/W.
Writing the energy balance, 
$PAR
\( \frac{T_j-T_\infty}{R_{fin}} = \frac{T_o- T_j}{R_{rock}} \Rightarrow \)
$PAR
\( T_j\left( \frac{R_{rock}}{R_{fin}}+1\right) = T_o + T_\infty \frac{R_{rock}}{R_{fin}} \Rightarrow T_j = $Tf^\circ\)C.
