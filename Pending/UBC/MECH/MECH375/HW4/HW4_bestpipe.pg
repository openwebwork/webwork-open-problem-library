$PAR

It is required to pump some hot liquid inside a duct. The duct is burried in a large body of soil. The surface area of the duct is required to be equal to \( A \), but the shape is still not determined. Two available options are semi-circle and square. If we model the conduction in the soil as a 2D problem, we may need to 
find the shape factor corresponding to each design. 

$PAR
a) The shape factor corresponding to the semi-circle cross section is 
\(S_{semi circle}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\times \sqrt{A}\) $BR

$PAR
b) The shape factor corresponding to the square cross section is 
\(S_{square}=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\times \sqrt{A}\) $BR

$PAR
(Hint: Use symmetric to construct the shapes you have avaiable in your textbook.)
