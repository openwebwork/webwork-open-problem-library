BEGIN_TEXT

A very long pipe with outer diameter $D cm is carrying hot water and is burried $H m
under ground. The pipe outside temperature is $T2 \(^\circ\)C. Conductivity of soil is $k W/m.K and its average temperature is $T1 \(^\circ\)C.
$PAR
a) If we model the conduction problem in the soil as a 2D problem, what is coresponding shape factor per unit length of the pipe?
\(S/L=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

$PAR
b) What is the rate of heat transfer per unit length of the pipe?

\(q'=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m $BR
$PAR
