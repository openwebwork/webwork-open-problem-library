$PAR
Surface of a steel pipe with diameter \(D=\) $D cm is maintained at temperature \(T_s=\) $T1\(^\circ\) C in a large room where the walls temperature is at \(T_{sur}=\) $T2\(^\circ\) C.
The emissivity of the pipe surface is $eps. Find:
$PAR
(a)  The surface emissive power \(E= \) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\) $BR
(b)  The surface irradiation  \(G= \) \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m\(^2\) $BR
(c)  Heat loss  per unit length of pipe due to radiation (assuming the pipe is a $EITALIC graybody $EITALIC ) \(q'= \)  \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m

$PAR
$BITALIC$BBOLD Boltzmann constant is \(\sigma =  5.67\times 10^{-8} \) W/m\(^2\).K\(^4\) $EBOLD$EITALIC
