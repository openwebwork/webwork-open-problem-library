The coldest winter temperature in Mission, BC is recorded $T1\(^\circ\) C. Conductivity of glass is $k W/m.K.
Assuming the temperature inside a room with a glass window with thickness of $t mm is $T2\(^\circ\) C, find:
$PAR
(a) Total heat flux that leaves the room. $BR
(b) Total heat loss, if the window dimensions are 2m by 2m.  $BR
(c) Total heat flux, if the glass thickness is doubled. $BR
(d) Total heat flux, if the window is replaced with a double layer window with thickness of $t2 mm and conductivity of $k2 W/m.K.
