$PAR
A thick wooden plate is exposed to air at temperature \(T_{air}=\) $Tair \(^\circ\)C. Due to different material roughness, on one side with surface temperaure \(T_1=\) $T1 \(^\circ\)C, the convective heat transfer coefficient is \(h_1=\) $h1 W/m\(^2\).K while on the other side it is \(h_2=\) $h2 W/m\(^2\).K. Assuming the object is at steady state, and radiation is negligible, what is temperaure \(T_2\) ? 
$PAR

\(T_2\)= \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\)C

BEGIN_SOLUTION

We need to write down the energy balance. The object is at steady state condition and is only losing/gaining heat by convection. Therefore
\( q_{conv,1} + q_{conv,2} = 0 
\Rightarrow  h_1 A(T_1-T_{air}) + h_2 A (T_2-T_{air}) =0 
\Rightarrow  T_2 = T_{air} - \frac{h_1}{h_2} (T_1-T_{air}) 
\Rightarrow T_2 = $Tair - \frac{$h1}{$h2}($T1 - $Tair) = $T2^\circ\)C.
