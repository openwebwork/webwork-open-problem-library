$PAR
A chemical reaction is taking place in a cylinder of \(D=\) $D m. The rate of energy generated by the reaction is modelled by \(q''' =\) $q \( \left[1-\frac{r}{$D} \right] \) where \(r\) is the radial coordinate, measured in meters, and varies  from \( 0 \leq r \leq D/2 \) and \(q'''\) is rate of energy generated per unit volume  (W/m\(^3\)). Notice that \(q'''\) is spatially nonuniform.

$PAR
a) Find rate of energy generated per unit length of cylinder (HINT: You may need to integrate the above function.)
$PAR
\(q'_{rad}\)= \{ans_rule(10)\} W/m

$PAR

b) Air is blown on the cylinder to control its temperature. The air temperature is \(T_\infty =\) $T1 and the convection heat transfer coefficient is estimated to be \(h=\) $h W/m\(^2\).K. Compute the steady state temperature of the surface of the cylinder. 

$PAR
\(T_{s}\)= \{ans_rule(10)\} \(^\circ\) C (no need for units here)

### SOLUTION
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
a)
$PAR
\(q' = \int_0^{D/2} q''' 2\pi r ~\mathrm{d}r = \int_0^{$D/2} $q \left[1-\frac{r}{$D} \right] 2\pi r ~\mathrm{d}r =  2\pi ($q) \int_0^{$R} r - r^2/$D ~\mathrm{d}r \Rightarrow \)
$PAR
\( q'= 2\pi ($q) \left[r^2/2 -\frac{r^3}{3\times $D} \right]_0^{$R} = $q2\) W/m.
$PAR
b)
\(q'_{conv} = h\pi D (T_s-T_\infty) \Rightarrow T_s = T_\infty + \frac{q'_{conv} }{h\pi D} = $T1 + \frac{$q2}{$h($D)\pi} = $T2 ^\circ\) C
