*Stripping ratio*  

Given the following parameters:  

*-* Mining cost for ore using open pit mining = [` $ [$Ore_cost_open_pit]/t`]  
*-* Mining cost for ore using underground mining = [` $ [$Ore_cost_underground]/t`]  
*-* Mining cost for waste rock (open pit mining) = [` $ [$Waste_cost_open_pit]/t`]  
*-* Density of Coal = [`  [$Density_coal]t/m^3`]  
*-* Density of Waste = [`  [$Density_waste]t/m^3`]  
*-* Overall pit slopes are as shown  
*-* Deposit is a seam of coal with [`[$true_thickness]`] [`metres`] true thickness and [`60`] degree dip  
*-* Pit wall angle [`\theta`] is given to be [`[$right_pit_wall_angle]`]  
*-* Topography is completely flat  
*-* Bench height of [`[$Bench_height]`] [`metres`]  
*-* Each bench to follow the same slope configuration as the final pit  
*-* Assume no waste is mined underground

Answer each of the questions below: 

*Part A.* At what mining depth would you recommend ending the open pit and switching the mining operation from an open pit to an underground method?  

 
Mining depth = [_____]{"$answer_depth_mining"} [`m`]  


*Part B.* What is the instantaneous breakeven stripping ratio at this point (in [`tonnage/tonnage`])?    

Instantaneous breakeven stripping ratio = [_____]{"$answer_instantaneous_answer"} [`tonnage/tonnage`]  


*Part C.* What is the overall stripping ratio at this point (in [`tonnage/tonnage`])?  

Overall stripping ratio = [_____]{"$answer_overall_answer"} [`tonnage/tonnage`]
