"Which of the following statements regarding strengthening mechanisms in crystal structures is correct?", 
"Strain fields are associated with dislocations and substitutional atoms within a crystal structure."

"Strain hardening strengthens a material by increasing dislocation movement and density.",
"The tensile strength of zinc is greater than that of brass, a copper-zinc alloy, regardless of the alloy's chemical composition.",
"A large substitutional atom is introduced into a crystal structure with atoms of smaller radius, inducing a tensile stress in the lattice.",
