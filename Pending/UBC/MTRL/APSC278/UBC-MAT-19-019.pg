#  Setup


$mc2 = new_multiple_choice();
$mc2->qa(
"Hydrogen fluoride (`HF`) has a lower molecular weight compared to hydrogen chloride (`HCl`), yet its boiling temperature is much higher. Choose the best explanation for this phenomenon: ", 
"Two types of secondary (or intermolecular) bonding are present between hydrogen fluoride molecules, whereas only one type of secondary bonding is present between hydrogen chloride molecules"
);
$mc2->extra(
"The bond between hydrogen and chlorine has greater ionic character compared to that of hydrogen and fluorine",
"The chlorine atom has a lower electronegativity than fluorine, thereby making the bond within the molecule weaker",
"The equilibrium distance between atoms within the HF molecule is smaller than that for the HCl molecule");
