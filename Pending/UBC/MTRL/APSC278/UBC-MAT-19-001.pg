BEGIN_PGML

In a uniaxial test, a force applied along the axis of a steel cylindrical specimen causes elastic deformation. Given that its initial diameter is [`[$diameter]\;mm`], determine the magnitude of this force that will produce a [`[$diamchange]\;mm`] elastic change in diameter. For steel, [`v`] = [`0.30`] and [`E`] =  [`207`] [`GPa`].  

Magnitude of Force = [_____]{"$magnitude_force"} [`\cdot \: 10^{6} \: N`]

# *1 - Stripping ratio:*  

# Given the following parameters:  

# *-* Mining cost for ore usign open pit mining [`= $ [$Ore_cost_open_pit]/t`]  
# *-* Mining cost for ore using underground mining [`= $ [$Ore_cost_underground]/t`]  
# *-* Mining cost for wast rock (open pit mining) is [`= $ [$Waste_cost_open_pit]/t`]  
# *-* Density of Coal [`=  [$Density_coal]t/m^3`]  
# *-* Density of Waste [`=  [$Density_waste]t/m^3`]  
# *-* Overall pit slopes are as shown  
# *-* Deposit is a seam of coal with [`[$true_thickness]`] [`metres`] true thickness and [`60`] degree dip  
# *-* Topography is completely flat  
# *-* Bench height of [`[$Bench_height]`] [`metres`]  
# *-* Each bench to follow the same slope configuration as the final pit  
# *-* No waste is mined underground

# [@ image("UBC-DYN-18-089.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

# Answer each of the questions below: 

# *Part A.* At what mining depth would you recommend ending the open pit and switching the mining operation from an open pit to an underground method?





# Two uniform thin rods each of mass [`m`] and length [`L`] are connected in a linkage. [`A`] is a fixed pin joint, [`B`] is a pin joint between the two rods, and [`D`] is a pin that slides freely in the frictionless vertical slot. Assume the system is released from rest at the instant shown (*state 1*).

# [@ image("UBC-DYN-18-089.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

# *a)* Find an expression for the total energy  in the system at *state 1* (the position shown) in terms of [`m`], [`L`], and velocities. Include a sketch of the system, showing relevant velocities and datum(s).

# [`E_1=`] [_____]{"$total_energy_state1"} [`J`]  

# *b)* Find an expression for the total energy in the system at a later time when [`A`] and [`D`] are at the same height (*state 2*) in terms of [`m`], [`L`], and velocities. Include a sketch of the system, showing relevant velocities and datum(s). (_HINT: suggest using ICZV._) (Enter *Wab* for [`\omega_{AB}`] and *Wbd* for [`\omega_{BD}`] )

# [`E_2=`] [_____]{"$total_energy_state2"} [`J`]  

# *c)* Find an expression for the velocity of [`D`] at *state 2* ([`A`] and [`D`] at the same height).

# [`v_{D_2}=`] [_____]{"$V_D"} [`m/s`]
