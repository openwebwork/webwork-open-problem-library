BEGIN_PGML

A cylindrical pipe with an inner diameter of [`[$diameter]`] m will be used to transport pressurized gas. Given that the atmospheric pressure outside the pipe is 0.101 MPa, and that of the pressurized gas is 100 times the outside pressure, what is the minimum thickness for a pipe made of a steel alloy (yield strength is 1000 MPa)? Use a safety factor of [`[$SF]`].   

The circumferential stress within a pipe is given as:   
>>[`\sigma\:=\: \frac{r_i \delta P}{t}`]<<  
  

Where [`r_i`] is the inner radius of the pipe, [`\delta P`] is the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipe, and [`t`] is the pipe thickness.   

  

Minimum thickness = [_____]{"$thickness"} [`mm`]
