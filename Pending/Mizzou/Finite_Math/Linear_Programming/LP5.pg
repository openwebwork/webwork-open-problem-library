BEGIN_TEXT

A company manufactures two models of snowboards, standard and deluxe.
Each deluxe model requires $co1 hours to produce, and $co2 units of material. 
Each standard model requires $b hours to produce and $c units of material. 
The company has $co4 production hours available and $co5 units of material 
in stock. The deluxe model sells for  $DOLLAR$co3 and the standard model 
sells for $DOLLAR$d. 
$BR What amount of each model should be produced and 
sold to obtain the maximum revenue? 

\{ans_rule(5)\} deluxe models and  \{ans_rule(5)\} standard models
$BR
What is the maximum revenue? 

 $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(10)\}
