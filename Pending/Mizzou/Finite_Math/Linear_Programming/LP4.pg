BEGIN_TEXT
A couple wants to invest up to $DOLLAR$P. They can purchase
a type A bond yielding $c1$PERCENT return and a type B bond yielding a
$c2$PERCENT return on the amount invested.
They also want to invest at least as much in the type A bond as in the type B bond.
They will also invest at least $DOLLAR$a in type A and no more than
$DOLLAR$b in type B bond. 
$BR
How much should they invest in each type of bond to maximize their return?
$BR
$BR
Let \( x \) be the amount invested in type A bond and
\( y\) the amount invested in type B bond.
$BR
$BR
a) Write the objective function to be maximized. $BR
$SPACE \(P =\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$BR 
b) The feasible region has 3 corner points. Two of them are on the x-axis. From left to right, they are:
(\{ ans_rule(5) \}, 0) and (\{ ans_rule(5) \}, 0). The third is the point \( (a,a) \) where \( a \)= \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$BR
$BR
c) Determine the amount to be invested in each bond to maximize the return
and determine the maximum return:
$BR
Amount to be invested in type A bonds:$SPACE  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(15) \}  
$BR
Amount to be invested in type B bonds: $SPACE $DOLLAR  \{ans_rule(15) \} 
$BR
Maximum return is:$SPACE $DOLLAR  \{ans_rule(15) \}
