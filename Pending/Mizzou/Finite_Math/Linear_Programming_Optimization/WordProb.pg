BEGIN_TEXT
A company is considering two insurance plans with the following types of coverage and premiums:

$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ begintable(3) \}
\{ row(" ", "Plan A","Plan B" ) \}
\{ row( "Fire/Theft", "${DOLLAR}\($ta\)", "${DOLLAR}\($tb\)" ) \}
\{ row( "Liability", "${DOLLAR}\($la\)" , "${DOLLAR}\($lb\)"   ) \}
\{ row( "Monthly Premium", "${DOLLAR}\($a\)" , "${DOLLAR}\($b\)"   ) \}
\{ endtable() \}
$ECENTER
$PAR

Premiums are sold in units. For example, one can buy one unit of plan A insurance for \($a1\) per month and receive \($ta1\) in Theft/Fire insurance. Two units of plan A insurance cost \($a2\) per month and give \($ta2\) in Theft/Fire insurance. The company wants at least \($theft\) in coverage for Theft/Fire insurance and \($liability\) in coverage for liability insurance. 
$PAR
How many units of each plan should be purchased to meet the needs of the company while minimizing cost?    $BR
The company should purchase \{ans_rule(10)\} units of plan A and \{ans_rule(10)\} units of plan B.
$PAR
What is the minimum monthly premium for the company? \{ans_rule(20)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD your answer is a dollar amount and should include a dollar symbol).
