$PAR
Solution:
$PAR
This partial differential equation is a second order equation because the highest order derivative is two
(in both variables).  It is linear because there are no shenanigans like multiplication of derivative terms or 
raising function or derivative terms to some power other than one. Altogether, it is a linear second order PDE.
