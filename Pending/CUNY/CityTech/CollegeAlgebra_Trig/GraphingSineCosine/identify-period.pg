Does this graph have the shape of [` \sin(x) `] or [` \cos(x) `]? [__________]{$ansF}

What is the period of the graphed function? [_____]{$period}

State the formula for the function that is graphed above. [` y = `] [__________]{$f}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Do you recall the difference between the graphs of sine and cosine?  
    _[`\sin(x)`] passes through the origin, and [`\cos(x)`] does not._

Remember that from a function [` \sin( B x ) `] or [` \cos( B x ) `], the period [` p `] is given by the equation [`` p = \frac{ 2 \pi }{ B } ``].  
However, when starting from a graph, we must work backwards since we know the period first, and need to find [` B `] from it.

Can you figure out the value of [` B `] and then state the function for the graph shown above?

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We can tell that this is a graph of [`[$ansF]**`] because we [@($choice==0)?"":"don't"@] pass through the origin.  
    _So we know our equation will look like [` [@"y = A"."\\"."$trig[$choice](Bx)"@] `]_

Our amplitude must be [`[$amp]`] because our graph extends up to [`[$amp]`] and down to [`[@-$amp@]`] on the [`y`]-axis.

*To determine the period*, look at how long it takes _(in the [`x`] direction)_ to complete one full wave:  
Our graph travels [`[$period]`] units to complete a full wave.

So we know that [`p=[$period]`].  

In order to find the equation for this graph, *we must figure out the coefficient for x*, [`B`].  

We also know that [`B`] and the period are related by the formula: [`p = \frac{2\pi}{B}`].

Therefore, we have [` [$period] = \frac{2\pi}{B} `]  
    So, [` [$period]B = 2\pi `]
    and then [` B = \frac{2\pi}{[$period]} `].

Now we know enough to give the equation for this graph:  
    * Amplitude: [` A = [$amp] `]
    * [`x`] coefficient: [` B = [$B] `]

Therefore, our formula for this graph is [`y=[$f]`].
