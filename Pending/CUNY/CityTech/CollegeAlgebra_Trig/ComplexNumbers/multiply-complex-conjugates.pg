BEGIN_PGML_HINT


* Multiply as you would any two binomials.

* Make sure that you're only combining "like" terms.

* It's fair enough to consider [`i`] as you would any other variable.

* Just make sure to remember that [`i`] has a specific value - unlike variables.

* For example, you may not leave [`i^2`] unsimplified, as you could with an [`x^2`].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[`([$c1])([$c2])`]

* Distribute: 

 _First_: 
[` \quad [$aR] \cdot [$bR] = \color{blue}{[$aRbR]} `]

_Outside_: 
[` \quad [$aR] \cdot [$bI] i = \color{blue}{[$aRbI] i} `]

_Inside_: 
[` \quad [$aI] i \cdot [$bR] = \color{blue}{[$aIbR] i} `]

_Last_: 
[`\quad [$aI] i \cdot [$bI] i = [$aIbI] i^2 \quad\longrightarrow\quad [$aIbI] i^2 = [$aIbI] \cdot -1 = \color{blue}{-[$aIbI]} `]

* Combine like terms: 

>> [`\begin{align*} 
\color{blue}{[$aRbR] + [$aRbI] i + [$aIbR] i - [$aIbI]} & = [$ansR] + ([$aRbI] + [$aIbR]) i \\
& = [$ansR] + [$ansI] i \\
\end{align*}
`]<<
