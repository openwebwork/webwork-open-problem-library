BEGIN_PGML

Rewrite the equation for this circle in Standard Form:

>> [` [$LHS] = [$RHS] `] <<

Standard Form: [_______________]{$standard} [` = `] [_____]{$r2}

* _Remember_: The standard form for a circle is [` (x-H)^2 + (y-K)^2 = R^2 `].

Center: [__________]{$center}

Radius: [_____]{$r}

* Do not use decimal approximations.
* Enter radicals such as [` \sqrt{15} `] as 'sqrt(15)' instead of using rational exponents.
* You do not need to reduce your radicals for this problem.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Recall the standard notation for the equation of a circle:  
[` (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 `]

Where [`(h,k)`] is the center of the circle, and [`r`] is the radius.

In order to get there, you'll need to complete the square for *both* [` x^2 - [$XB] x `] and [` y^2 - [$YB] y `].

Don't forget that expressions such as [`x+h`] can be rewritten as [`x-(-h)`] if necessary...

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

*[@($C>0)?"Subtract":"Add"@] [@abs($C)@] on both sides:*

    [` ([$LHS]) - [$C] = [$RHS] - [$C] `]

    [` x^2 - [$XB] x + y^2 - [$YB] y = [@-$C@] `]

*Group the [`x`] and [`y`] terms:*

    [` (x^2 - [$XB] x) + (y^2 - [$YB] y) = [@-$C@] `]

*Complete the square for the [`x`] terms:*

    [` (x^2 - [$XB] x) `] needs [` + [$XC] `] to complete the square.

    _Add [$XC] to both sides:_  
    [` (x^2 - [$XB] x + [$XC] ) + (y^2 - [$YB] y) = [@-$C@] + [$XC] `]

    _Then factor the completed square:_  
    [` ( x - [$h] )^2 + (y^2 - [$YB] y) = [@-$C+$XC@] `]

*Complete the square for the [`x`] terms:*

    [` (y^2 - [$YB] y) `] needs [` + [$YC] `] to complete the square.

    _Add [$YC] to both sides:_  
    [` ( x - [$h] )^2 + (y^2 - [$YB] y + [$YC]) = [@-$C+$XC@] +[$YC] `]

    _Then factor the completed square:_  
    [` ( x - [$h] )^2 + ( y - [$k] )^2 = [$r2] `]

*Rewrite the necessary portions of our equation:*

    [`(x-[$h])^2`] [@($h>0)?"does not need to be rewritten.":"should be rewritten as $xRewrite ."@]**

    [`(y-[$k])^2`] [@($k>0)?"does not need to be rewritten.":"should be rewritten as $yRewrite ."@]**

    [` [$r2] `] is a perfect square, and should be rewritten as [` [$r]^2 `].

*Our equation now looks like:*

    [` \displaystyle \left( x - [@($h>0)?"":"("@][$h][@($h>0)?"":")"@]\right)^2 + \left( y - [@($k>0)?"":"("@][$k][@($k>0)?"":")"@]\right)^2 = [$r]^2 `]

From this, we can identify the following:  
    [` h = [$h] `]  
    [` k = [$k] `]  
    [` r = [$r] `]

So our center is [` ([$h],[$k]) `] and our radius is [`[$r]`].
