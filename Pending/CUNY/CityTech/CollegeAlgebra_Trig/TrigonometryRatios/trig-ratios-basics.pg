Use "AB", "BC", and "AC" as the side lengths.

* [` \sin(B) = `] [________]{$sinB}
* [` \cos(B) = `] [________]{$cosB}
* [` \tan(B) = `] [________]{$tanB}


* [` \sin(C) = `] [________]{$sinC}
* [` \cos(C) = `] [________]{$cosC}
* [` \tan(C) = `] [________]{$tanC}

Remember that "opposite" and "adjacent" legs depend on which angle you're looking at.

Use SOHCAHTOA if you're having trouble remembering which trig ratios are which.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

The hypotenuse is always the same, no matter which angle we're looking at.

Which leg is opposite angle [`B`]?  
Which leg is adjacent to angle [`B`]?

Which leg is opposite angle [`C`]?  
Which leg is adjacent to angle [`C`]?
