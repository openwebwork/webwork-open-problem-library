BEGIN_PGML

This polynomial is *not* factorable, so you need to use the _complete the square_ method.

Solve the equation for x.

    [`` \large{ [$LHS] = [$RHS] } ``]  

END_PGML

Scaffold::Begin();
Section::Begin("Step 1: Separate the constant term");
BEGIN_PGML
First, separate the constant term from the terms with variables.

    [` \large{ [$LHS1] = } `] [_____]{$ans1}
END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 2: Complete the Square");
BEGIN_PGML

    [`` \large{ [$LHS1] = [$ans1] } ``]

Find the value that will make the left-hand side into a perfect square trinomial, and add it to both sides of the equation.

    [` \large{ [$LHS1] + } `] [_____]{$ans2} [` \large= `] [_____]{$ans3}
END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 3: Factor the completed square");
BEGIN_PGML

    [`` \large{ [$LHS1] + [$ans2] = [$ans3] } ``]

Now that the left-hand side is a perfect square, factor it.

    [__________]{$ans4->cmp(checker=>$factorCheck)} [` \large{ = [$ans3] } `]
END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 4: Use the Square Root Property");
BEGIN_PGML

    [`` \large{ [$ans4] = [$ans3] } ``]

Take the square root of both sides, remembering the square root property (there are _two_ square roots to consider, the positive *and* the negative!)

    [` \large{ [$LHS5] = } `] [_____]{$ans5}
END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 5: Finish solving");
BEGIN_PGML

    [`` \large{ [$LHS5] = \sqrt{[$ans3]} \text{  or  } [$LHS5] = -\sqrt{[$ans3]} } ``]

Finally, solve for x. Remember to deal with each root separately!

    [` \large{ x = } `] [____________________]{$ans6}

BEGIN_PGML
* If your answer contains non-integer values, use fractions, not decimals.
* If you need to use the square root symbol as in [`\sqrt{5}`], type it using *sqrt(5)*.
* If there are no solutions, enter *no solutions*.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

For _Step 1_, [@ ($C>0)?"subtract":"add" @] [` [$absC] `] on both sides.

For _Step 2_, determine a value for the constant term that will make the left side of the equation into a perfect square trinomial: [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 `].

For _Step 3_, factor the perfect square trinomial on the left side:  
    [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 = ( x + A )^2 `]  

For _Step 4_, remember that equations such as [` x^2 = A `] has solutions [` x = \pm \sqrt{A} `]

For _Step 5_, you should have two equations to solve.

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For _Step 1_, [@ ($C>0)?"subtract":"add" @] [` [$absC] `] on both sides.  
    [` ([$LHS]) - [$C] = ([$RHS]) - [$C]`]  
    [` [$LHS1] = [$ans1] `]

For _Step 2_, if [` [$LHS1] `] is going to look like [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 `],  
then [` 2Ax `] will match [` [$B]x `] when [` A `] is [` [$halfB] `],  
which means we need [` A^2 `] to complete the square.  
To complete the square, we add [` [$ans2] `] to both sides:  
    [` [$LHS1] + [$ans2] = [$ans1] + [$ans2] `]  
    [` [$LHS1] + [$ans2] = [$ans3] `]  

For _Step 3_, we factor the left side:  
    [` [$LHS1] + [$ans2] = [$ans3] `]  
    [` [$ans4] = [$ans3] `]  

For _Step 4_, apply the square root property:  
    [` [$ans4] = [$ans3] `]  
    [` [$LHS5] = \pm \sqrt{[$ans3]} = \pm [$root] `]  
So, [` [$LHS5] = [$root] `] or [` [$LHS5] = -[$root] `]

For _Step 5_, solve the equations:  
    [` [$LHS5] = [$root] `]  
    [` x = [$root] + [$halfB] `]  

or

    [` [$LHS5] = -[$root] `]  
    [` x = -[$root] + [$halfB] `]
