Use the _complete the square_ method to find the vertex of the following parabola:

_Note: There will be some extra steps because the coefficient of [` x^2 `] is *not* 1._

[` \large{ [$LHS] = [$RHS] } `]  

END_PGML

Scaffold::Begin();
Section::Begin("Step 1: Separate non-x-terms from x-terms");
BEGIN_PGML

Manipulate the equation until all terms containing _x_ are on one side of the equation, and all terms *not* containing _x_ are on the opposite side:

>> [__________]{$LHS1} [` \large{  = [$RHS1] } `] <<

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 2: Divide off the coefficient of \(x^2\)");
BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ [$LHS1] = [$RHS1] } `]

There's a slight problem with completing the square at this point, and it's because we have a coefficient of [` x^2 `] that's not _1_.  

Divide both sides of the equation by [$A] so that we can proceed with completing the square.  

>> [____________]{$LHS1B} = [____________]{$RHS1B} <<

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 3: Identify the value that completes the square");
BEGIN_PGML

Now that we've removed the coefficient of [` x^2 `], what value completes the perfect square trinomial? 

>> [` \large{ [$RHS1B] + } `] [_____]{$CtS} <<

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 4: Complete the Square");
BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ [$LHS1B] = [$RHS1B] } `]

Add [$CtS] to both sides to complete the perfect square trinomial.

>> [__________]{$LHS2} [` \large{ = [$RHS2] } `] <<

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 5: Factor and start solving for \(y\)");
BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ [$LHS2] = [$RHS2] } `]

Factor the perfect square trinomial, and begin solving for [`y`].

>> [` \large{ \frac{y}{[$A]} = } `] [____________]{$ans1->cmp(checker=>$factorCheck)} <<

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 6: Finish solving for \(y\)");
BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ \frac{y}{[$A]} = [$ans1] } `]

Finish solving for y.

>> [` \large{ y = } `] [____________]{$ans2->cmp(checker=>$factorCheck)} <<

* Standard Form for a parabola is: [` y = A(x-H)^2 + K `]

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 7: Identify the vertex");
BEGIN_PGML

[` \large{ y = [$ans2] } `]

Try to determine the vertex just by thinking about how the graph of this equation is a shifted version of [` y = x^2 `]. 
    The vertex of [` y = x^2 `] is [` (0,0) `], what would the new vertex be after applying the shifts?

Otherwise, identify the values of _H_ and _K_ in our equation by comparing our equation to the form [` y = A(x-H)^2 + K `]. 
    (_Remember that expressions like [` x+1 `] can be re-written as [` x - (-1) `] and expressions like [` x - 1 `] can be re-written as [` x + (-1) `]_)

The vertex of our parabola will be [` (H,K) `].

What is the vertex of [` y = [$ans2] `]? [__________]{$vertex}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

For _Step 1_, [@ ($C>0)?"subtract":"add" @] [`[$absC]`] on both sides.

For _Step 2_, divide both sides by [$A] to reduce the coefficient of [`x^2`] to [`1`].

For _Step 3_, determine a value for the constant term that will make [`[$RHS1B]`] into a perfect square trinomial: [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 `].

For _Step 4_, the square was completed on the right side of the equation.  
    Look at how the right side of the equation was changed,  
    do the same on the left side of the equation to keep it balanced.  
    **Be careful when combining your fractions.**

For _Step 5_, do _NOT_ just isolate [`y`].  
    **Factor the perfect square _first_.**  
    Remember that [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 = (x + A)^2 `]  
    _Then_ you can begin solving for [`y`].  
    **Notice that this equation begins with "[` \frac{y}{[$A]} = `]"**  
    You will finish solving for [`y`] in the next step.

For _Step 6_, multiply both sides of the equation by [$A] to finish solving for [`y`].  
    Don't try to distribute the [`[$A]`] through the [`(x-h)^2`].  
    We want our equation in the form: [` y = A( x - h )^2 + k `]

For _Step 7_, now that you have the equation in vertex form,  
    you should be able to determine the value of [`h`] and [`k`].

You might need to rewrite your additions or subtractions to match vertex form.

[` y = A( x - h )^2 + k `]

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For _Step 1_, [@ ($C>0)?"subtract":"add" @] [` [$absC] `] on both sides.  
    [` ([$LHS]) - [$C] = ([$RHS]) - [$C] `]  
    [` [$LHS1] = [$RHS1] `]

For _Step 2_, we must deal with the coefficient of [`x^2`].  
    Divide both _sides_ by [$A]:  
    [` [$LHS1] = [$RHS1] `]  

    [`\frac{[$LHS1]}{[$A]} = \frac{[$RHS1]}{[$A]} `]  

    [`[$LHS1B] = [$RHS1B] `]  

For _Step 3_, if [` [$RHS1B] `] is going to look like [` x^2 + 2Ax + A^2 `],  
then [` 2Ax `] will match [` [$b]x `] when [` A `] is [`[@-$h@]`],  
which means we need [` A^2 `] to complete the square.  
    [` A^2 = [$CtS] `]  

    And [`[$RHS1B] + [$CtS] `] is our completed square.
  
For _Step 4_,we complete the square by adding [` [$CtS] `] to both sides: 
 
    [`([$LHS1B]) + [$CtS] = ([$RHS1B]) + [$CtS] `]  

    [`[$LHS2] = [$RHS2] `]  

For _Step 5_, we factor the left side first:  
    [`[$LHS2] = [$RHS2] `]  

    [`[$LHS2] = (x-[$h])^2 `]  

Then we begin solving for y:  
    [`[$LHS2] = (x-[$h])^2 `]  

    [` \frac{y}{[$A]} = [$ans1] `]  

For _Step 6_, we finish solving for y by multiplying both sides by [`[$A]`]:

    [` [$A]\left(\frac{y}{[$A]}\right) = [$A]\left([$ans1]\right) `]

    [` y = [$ans2] `] 

Finally, for _Step 7_, identify [`h`] and [`k`]:  
    [` y = [$ans2] `]  

    [`\displaystyle y = [$A] \left( x - ([$h]) \right)^2 + ([$k]) `]  

So [` h = [$h] `] and [` k = [$k] `].

Our vertex is [`([$h],[$k])`].
