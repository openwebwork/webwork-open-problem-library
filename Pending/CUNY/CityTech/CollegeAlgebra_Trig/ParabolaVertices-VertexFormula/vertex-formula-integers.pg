Find the vertex of [` \large{ y = [$RHS] } `] using the _vertex formula_.  

END_PGML

Scaffold::Begin();
Section::Begin("Step 1: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex");
BEGIN_PGML

For any parabola, [` y = Ax^2 + Bx + C `], the _x_-coordinate of the vertex will always be [` x = \frac{-B}{2A} `].

Using this formula, what is the _x_-coordinate of the vertex for the parabola [` y = [$RHS] `] ?

[` x = `] [_____]{$h}

END_PGML
Section::End();
Section::Begin("Step 2: Find the y-coordinate of the vertex");
BEGIN_PGML

Now that we know that the _x_-coordinate of the vertex is [` x = [$h] `], we only need to find the _y_-coordinate.

Fortunately, we know that [` y = [$RHS] `].

What is the _y_-coordinate that corresponds to [` x = [$h] `] ?

[` y = `] [______]{$k}

BEGIN_PGML
  
Give the vertex of the parabola [` y = [$RHS] `] as a point. [_________]{$vertex}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

For _Part 1_, identify the values of [`A`], [`B`], and [`C`].  
    Then compute [` \frac{-B}{2A} `].

For _Part 2_, the y-coordinate is given by [`y = [$RHS] `]  
    You already found the x-coordinate in part 1.  

    Substitute your [`x`] value to find [`y`].

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

**Identify A, B, and C**

[` A = [$A] `]; [` B = [$B] `]; [` C = [$C] `];

**Compute the x-coordinate:**

So the x-coordinate of the vertex is [` \frac{-B}{2A} `].

[` x_v = \frac{[@-$B@]}{2([$A])} = [$h] `]

**Compute the y-coordinate**

[` y = [$RHS] `] and [` x_v = [$h] `]

Substitute [`x`]: [` y_v = [@$RHS->substitute(x=>$h)@] = [$k] `]

So our vertex is [`([$h],[$k])`].
