BEGIN_PGML
  
  
*Factor by Grouping:* 

[` [$problem] `]

[______________]{$ans->cmp(checker=>$factorCheck)}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

*Begin by grouping the first two terms and last two terms:*  
_You must be careful, subtraction is *not* associative like addition is._

[` [@$c1*$c3@] A B + [@$c1*$c4@] A + ([@$c2*$c3@]) B + [@$c2*$c4@] `]

[` ([@$c1*$c3@] A B + [@$c1*$c4@] A) + (([@$c2*$c3@]) B + [@$c2*$c4@]) `]

Then find a common factor for each group.

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

*Begin by grouping the first two terms and last two terms:*  
_You must be careful, subtraction is *not* associative like addition is._

[` [@$c1*$c3@] A B + [@$c1*$c4@] A + [@$c2*$c3@] B + [@$c2*$c4@] `]

[` ([@$c1*$c3@] A B + [@$c1*$c4@] A) + ([@$c2*$c3@] B + [@$c2*$c4@]) `]

*Factor each group separately:*

[` ([@$c1*$c3@] A B + [@$c1*$c4@] A) \rightarrow [$c1] A ( [$c3] B + [$c4] ) `]

[` ([@$c2*$c3@] B + [@$c2*$c4@]) \rightarrow [$c2] ( [$c3] B + [$c4] ) `]

Each term is a multiple of [`[$c3] B + [$c4]`], so it is a common factor.

So, [` [$problem] \rightarrow [$c1] A ( [$c3] B + [$c4] ) + [$c2] ( [$c3] B + [$c4] ) `]

and [` [$c1] A ( [$c3] B + [$c4] ) + [$c2] ( [$c3] B + [$c4] ) \rightarrow [$ans] `]
