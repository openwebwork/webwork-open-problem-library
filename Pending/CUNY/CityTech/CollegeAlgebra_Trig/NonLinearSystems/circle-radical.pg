BEGIN_PGML

Solve the following system of equations.

[` y = \sqrt{x} `]

[` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

Solution(s): [_______________]

* Enter your answers as points: [` (x,y) `]
* Because these systems are non-linear, you may have more than one solution.
* If you have more than one solution, enter your answers as a list of points: [` (x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1) `]
* Use 'sqrt(...)' to enter radical answers, do not use decimal approximations.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

One of the equations is already solved for [`y`], try substituting for the [`y`] in the other equation...

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We should notice right away that one of the equations is solved for [`y`].

    [` y = \sqrt{x} `]

*Substitute [`\sqrt{x}`] for [`y`] in the second equation:*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    [` x^2 + (\sqrt{x})^2 = [$circleR] `]

*Now that we have an equation with a single variable, simplify and solve:*

    [` x^2 + x = [$circleR] `]

    _Subtract [$circleR] on both sides:_  
    [` x^2 + x - [$circleR] = [$circleR] - [$circleR] `]

    *Remember that as a quadratic, this equation should equal zero in order for us to eventually solve it.*  
    [` x^2 + x - [$circleR] = 0 `]

    _Factor:_  
    [` (x + [$x0])(x + [$x1]) = 0 `]

    So, either [` x = [@-$x0@] `] or [` x = [@-$x1@] `].

*We're looking at the intersection of two graphs, so our solutions are points.*

*Find the [`y`]-coordinates corresponding to each [`x`] value.*

    *When [` x = [@-$x0@] `] we have:*  
    [` y = \sqrt{[@-$x0@]} `]  
    But this [`y`]-coordinate is not a Real number.  
    So, [`x = [@-$x0@]`] does not correspond to a real solution.

    *When [` x = [@-$x1@] `] we have:*  
    [` y = \sqrt{[@-$x1@]} `]  
    So our solution is: [` ([@-$x1@],\sqrt{[@-$x1@]}) `]

*Double-check your work using the other equation:*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    For [` ([@-$x1@],\sqrt{[@-$x1@]}) `]:  
    Is [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$absx1,y=>$y1)->TeX@] = [$C] `]?
