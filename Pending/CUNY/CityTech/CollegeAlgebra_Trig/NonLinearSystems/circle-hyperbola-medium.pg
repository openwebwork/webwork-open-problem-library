BEGIN_PGML

Solve the following system of equations.

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

Solution(s): [_______________]

* Enter your answers as points: [` (x,y) `]
* Because these systems are non-linear, you may have more than one solution.
* If you have more than one solution, enter your answers as a list of points: [` (x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1) `]
* Use 'sqrt(...)' to enter radical answers, do not use decimal approximations.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Neither of these equations is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

However, it looks as though the elimination method might be useful here.

What should you multiply each equation by in order to eliminate either [`x`] or [`y`]?

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Neither equation is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

If we choose to eliminate [`y`], we must look for the GCF of [`[$cY1]`] and [`[$cY2]`].

    _The GCF of [`[$cY1]`] and [`[$cY2]`] is [@$cY1*$cY2@]_

In order to eliminate the [`y`] terms, multiply the first equation by [`[$cY2]`]:

    [` [@$cX1*$cY2@]x^2 + [@$cY1*$cY2@]y^2 = [@$circleR*$cY2@] `]

And multiply the second equation by [`[$cY1]`]:

    [` [@$cX2*$cY1@]x^2 - [@$cY1*$cY2@]y^2 = [@$hypR*$cY1@] `]

*Adding the two equations should now result in the elimination of [`y`]:*

    [` ([@$cX1*$cY2@]x^2 - [@$cY1*$cY2@]y^2) + ([@$cX2*$cY1@]x^2 + [@$cY1*$cY2@]y^2) = ([@$circleR*$cY2@]) + ([@$hypR*$cY1@]) `]

    [` [@$cX1*$cY2+$cX2*$cY1@] x^2 = [@$circleR*$cY2+$hypR*$cY1@] `]

*Now that we have an equation with a single variable, solve:*

    _Divide both sides by [@$cX1*$cY2+$cX2*$cY1@]:_  
    [` x^2 = [@$x**2@] `]

    *Remember that as a quadratic, this equation should equal zero in order for us to eventually solve it.*  
    [` x^2 - [@$x**2@] = [@$x**2@] - [@$x**2@] `]

    [` x^2 - [@$x**2@] = 0 `]

    _Factor:_  
    [` (x - [$x])(x + [$x]) = 0 `]

    So, either [` x = [$x] `] or [` x = -[$x] `].

*We're looking at the intersection of two graphs, so our solutions are points.*

*Find the [`y`]-coordinates corresponding to each [`x`] value.*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    *When [` x = [$x] `] we have:*  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->reduce->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [$cY1] y^2 = [@$circleR-$cX1*$x**2@] `]  
    [` [@($cY1==1)?"":"$cY1"@] y^2 - [@$cY1*$y**2@] = 0 `]  
    [` [@($cY1==1)?"":"$cY1"@] (y-[$y])(y+[$y]) = 0 `]  
    So we have two solutions corresponding to [`x=[$x]`]:  
    [` y = [$y] `] or [` y = -[$y] `]

    _As points:_ [`([$x],[$y])`] or [`([$x],-[$y])`]

    *When [` x = -[$x] `] we have:*  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>-$x)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->reduce->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@($cY1==1)?"":"$cY1"@] y^2 = [@$circleR-$cX1*$x**2@] `]  
    [` [@($cY1==1)?"":"$cY1"@] y^2 - [@$cY1*$y**2@] = 0 `]  
    [` [@($cY1==1)?"":"$cY1"@] (y-[$y])(y+[$y]) = 0 `]  
    So we have two solutions corresponding to [`x=-[$x]`]:  
    [` y = [$y] `] or [` y = -[$y] `]

    _As points:_ [`(-[$x],[$y])`] or [`(-[$x],-[$y])`]

*Double-check your work using the other equation:*

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

    For [` ([$x],[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$hypL->substitute(x=>$x,y=>$y)->TeX@] = [$hypR] `]?

    For [` ([$x],-[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$hypL->substitute(x=>$x,y=>-$y)->TeX@] = [$hypR] `]?

    For [` (-[$x],[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$hypL->substitute(x=>-$x,y=>$y)->TeX@] = [$hypR] `]?

    For [` (-[$x],-[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$hypL->substitute(x=>-$x,y=>-$y)->TeX@] = [$hypR] `]?
