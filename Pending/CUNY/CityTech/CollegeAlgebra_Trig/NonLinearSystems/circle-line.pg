BEGIN_PGML

Solve the following system of equations.

[` [$lineL] = [$lineR] `]

[` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

Solution(s): [_______________]{$ans}

* Enter your answers as points: [` (x,y) `]
* Because these systems are non-linear, you may have more than one solution.
* If you have more than one solution, enter your answers as a list of points: [` (x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1) `]
* Use 'sqrt(...)' to enter radical answers, do not use decimal approximations.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Try rewriting the line in [` y = m x + b `] form.

Then substitute for [`y`] in the second equation...

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

First, we should solve for [`y`] in the linear equation.

    [` [$lineL] = [$lineR] `]

    [` y = [$line] `]

*Substitute [`[$line]`] for [`y`] in the second equation:*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    [`\displaystyle x^2 + \left([$line]\right)^2 = [$circleR] `]

*Now that we have an equation with a single variable, expand and solve:*

    _Expand [`([$line])^2`]:_  

    [`\displaystyle x^2 + [$line2] = [$circleR] `]

    _Combine like terms and subtract [$circleR] on both sides:_  
    [`\displaystyle [$line2comb] - [$circleR] = [$circleR] - [$circleR] `]

    *Remember that as a quadratic, this equation should equal zero in order for us to eventually solve it.*  
    [` [$A1] x^2 - [@-$B->TeX@] x + [@$C-$r2@] = 0 `]

    _Clear denominators by multiplying by [@$delX**2@]:_  
    [` [@$A1*$delX**2@] x^2 - [@-$B*$delX**2@] x + [@($C-$r2)*$delX**2@] = 0 `]

    _Factor:_  
    [` [@$A1*$delX**2@][@($x1==0)?"x":"(x - [$x1])"@](x - [$x0]) = 0 `]

    So, either [` x = [$x1] `] or [` x = [$x0] `].

*We're looking at the intersection of two graphs, so our solutions are points.*

*Find the [`y`]-coordinates corresponding to each [`x`] value.*

    [` y = [$line] `]

    *When [` x = [$x1] `] we have:*  
    [` y = [@$line->substitute(x=>$x1)->TeX@] = [$y1] `]  
    So our first solution is: [` ([$x1],[$y1]) `]

    *When [` x = [$x0] `] we have:*  
    [` y = [@$line->substitute(x=>$x0)->TeX@] = [$y0] `]  
    So our second solution is: [` ([$x0],[$y0]) `]

*Double-check your work using the other equation:*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    For [` ([$x1],[$y1]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x1,y=>$y1)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]?

    For [` ([$x0],[$y0]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x0,y=>$y0)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]?
