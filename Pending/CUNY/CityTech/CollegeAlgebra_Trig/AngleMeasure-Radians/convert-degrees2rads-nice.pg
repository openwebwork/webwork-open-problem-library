Convert [` [$degrees[0]]^{\circ} `] into radian measure: [__________]{$radians[0]}

Convert [` [$degrees[1]]^{\circ} `] into radian measure: [__________]{$radians[1]}

Convert [` [$degrees[2]]^{\circ} `] into radian measure: [__________]{$radians[2]}

Convert [` [$degrees[3]]^{\circ} `] into radian measure: [__________]{$radians[3]}

* Enter your answer as a fraction of _pi_

* You may also use decimal approximation, but your answer must be accurate to at least 3 decimal places.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

If you're familiar with unit conversion, this is pretty much the same thing.

You want to multiply by a fraction that's equivalent to 1 (_because multiplying by 1 won't change the value_).

But the fraction will have different units in the numerator and denominator.

In the denominator you put the units that you want to remove, and in the numerator you put the units that you want to end up with.

In this case, you want to remove degrees, and have radians instead.

So you need two equivalent measurements - one in radians, and one in degrees.  

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

For converting between radians and degrees, we rely on the fact that [` 360^{\circ} = 2\pi `] radians.

This means we can use the conversion factors:
[` \frac{2\pi}{360^{\circ}} `] or [` \frac{360^{\circ}}{2\pi} `]

To convert _from_ degrees, _to_ radians, we need to cancel out the existing degrees.  
That means putting [`360^{\circ}`] in the denominator.  
So we'll be using [` \frac{2\pi}{360^{\circ}} `], which is often reduced: [` \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}} `]

_Note that both fractions are equivalent to 1, since we're taking a measurement divided by the same measurement._  
If you're having trouble seeing that, think of [`\frac{1 \text{ft}}{12 \text{in}}`] or [` \frac{60 \text{min}}{1 \text{hr}} `]. They're both equivalent to 1 as well.

1. [` [$degrees[0]]^{\circ} \rightarrow [$degrees[0]]^{\circ} \times \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}} \rightarrow \frac{[$degrees[0]]\pi}{180} \rightarrow [$radians[0]] `]

2. [` [$degrees[1]]^{\circ} \rightarrow [$degrees[1]]^{\circ} \times \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}} \rightarrow \frac{[$degrees[1]]\pi}{180} \rightarrow [$radians[1]] `]

3. [` [$degrees[2]]^{\circ} \rightarrow [$degrees[2]]^{\circ} \times \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}} \rightarrow \frac{[$degrees[2]]\pi}{180} \rightarrow [$radians[2]] `]

4. [` [$degrees[3]]^{\circ} \rightarrow [$degrees[3]]^{\circ} \times \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}} \rightarrow \frac{[$degrees[3]]\pi}{180} \rightarrow [$radians[3]] `]
