BEGIN_PGML

Solve the following system of equations.

[` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

[` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

Solution(s): [_______________]{$ans}

* Enter your answers as points: [` (x,y) `]
* Use 'sqrt(...)' to enter radical answers, do not use decimal approximations.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Neither of these equations is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

However, it looks as though the elimination method might be useful here.

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Neither equation is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

*Adding the two equations should result in the elimination of [`y`]:*

    [` ([$hypL]) + ([$circleL]) = ([$hypR]) + ([$circleR]) `]

    [` [@2*$cX@] x = [@$hypR+$circleR@] `]

*Now that we have an equation with a single variable, solve:*

    _Divide both sides by [@2*$cX@]:_  
    [` x = [@($hypR+$circleR)/(2*$cX)@] `]

*We're looking at the intersection of two graphs, so our solutions are points.*

*Find the [`y`]-coordinate corresponding to our [`x`] value.*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    *When [` x = [$x] `] we have:*  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->reduce->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@($cY==1)?"":"$cY"@] y = [@$circleR-$cX*$x@] `]  
    [` y = [$y] `] 

    _As a point:_ [`([$x],[$y])`] 

*Double-check your work using the other equation:*

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

    For [` ([$x],[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$hypL->substitute(x=>$x,y=>$y)->TeX@] = [$hypR] `]?
