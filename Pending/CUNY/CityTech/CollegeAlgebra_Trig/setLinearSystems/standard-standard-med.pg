BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Neither of these equations is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

However, it looks as though the elimination method might be useful here.

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Neither equation is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

In order to eliminate the [`y`] terms, multiply the first equation by [`-1`]:

    [` -x - [@($cY==1)?"":"$cY"@]y = -[$ellipseR] `]

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

*Adding the two equations should now result in the elimination of [`y`]:*

    [` (-x - [@($cY==1)?"":"$cY"@]y) + ([$circleL]) = (-[$ellipseR]) + ([$circleR]) `]

    [` [@$cX-1@] x = [@-$ellipseR+$circleR@] `]

*Now that we have an equation with a single variable, solve:*

    _Divide both sides by [@$cX-1@]:_  
    [` x = [@(-$ellipseR+$circleR)/($cX-1)@] `]

*We're looking at the intersection of two graphs, so our solutions are points.*

*Find the [`y`]-coordinates corresponding to each [`x`] value.*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    *When [` x = [$x] `] we have:*  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->reduce->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@($cY==1)?"":"$cY"@] y = [@$circleR-$cX*$x@] `]  
    [` y = [$y] `] 

    _As a point:_ [`([$x],[$y])`] 

*Double-check your work using the other equation:*

    [` [$ellipseL] = [$ellipseR] `]

    For [` ([$x],[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$ellipseL->substitute(x=>$x,y=>$y)->TeX@] = [$ellipseR] `]?
