BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Neither of these equations is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

However, it looks as though the elimination method might be useful here.

What should you multiply each equation by in order to eliminate either [`x`] or [`y`]?

END_PGML_HINT
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Neither equation is easily solved for either [`x`] or [`y`].

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

If we choose to eliminate [`y`], we must look for the GCF of [`[$cY1]`] and [`[$cY2]`].

    _The GCF of [`[$cY1]`] and [`[$cY2]`] is [@$cY1*$cY2@]_

In order to eliminate the [`y`] terms, multiply the first equation by [`[$cY2]`]:

    [` [@$cX1*$cY2@]x + [@$cY1*$cY2@]y = [@$circleR*$cY2@] `]

And multiply the second equation by [`[$cY1]`]:

    [` [@$cX2*$cY1@]x - [@$cY1*$cY2@]y = [@$hypR*$cY1@] `]

*Adding the two equations should now result in the elimination of [`y`]:*

    [` ([@$cX1*$cY2@]x - [@$cY1*$cY2@]y) + ([@$cX2*$cY1@]x + [@$cY1*$cY2@]y) = ([@$circleR*$cY2@]) + ([@$hypR*$cY1@]) `]

    [` [@$cX1*$cY2+$cX2*$cY1@] x = [@$circleR*$cY2+$hypR*$cY1@] `]

*Now that we have an equation with a single variable, solve:*

    _Divide both sides by [@$cX1*$cY2+$cX2*$cY1@]:_  
    [` x = [@$x@] `]

*We're looking at the intersection of two graphs, so our solutions are points.*

*Find the [`y`]-coordinates corresponding to our [`x`] value.*

    [` [$circleL] = [$circleR] `]

    *When [` x = [$x] `] we have:*  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [@$circleL->substitute(x=>$x)->reduce->TeX@] = [$circleR] `]  
    [` [$cY1] y = [@$circleR-$cX1*$x@] `]  
    [` y = [$y] `]

    _As a point:_ [`([$x],[$y])`] 

*Double-check your work using the other equation:*

    [` [$hypL] = [$hypR] `]

    For [` ([$x],[$y]) `]:  
    Is [` [@$hypL->substitute(x=>$x,y=>$y)->TeX@] = [$hypR] `]?
