BEGIN_PGML

Guiding text suggestions:  
* in a more "realistic" setting, movement isn't happening at a constant speed
* again empasize difference between "distance travelled" and "displacement"
* "displacement" is change in position (in this case, relative to the ground)
* direction is an important aspect of rates-of-change (taking off? landing?)
* speed with direction is called _*velocity*_

[$im]***

A water balloon is thrown upward from a window that is [$c] meters high with an initial velocity of [$b] meters per second. The function [`f(t) = [$ft]`] describes the height of the water balloon (in meters) at time [`t`], measured in seconds from the initial release of the balloon.

1. What is the average velocity for the duration of the water balloon's flight?  
    a. How much time elapsed from launch until impact? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt}
    b. What is the displacement of the water balloon over this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy}
    c. What was the average velocity during this interval? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg}

1. What is the average velocity of the water balloon between [`t=[$t1start]`] and [`t=[$t1end]`]?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt1}
    b. What is the displacement of the water balloon for this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy1}
    c. What was the average velocity for [`[$t1start] \leq t \leq [$t1end]`]? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg1}

1. What is the average velocity of the water balloon between [`t=[$t2start]`] and [`t=[$t2end]`]?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt2}
    b. What is the displacement of the water balloon for this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy2}
    c. What was the average velocity for [`[$t2start] \leq t \leq [$t2end]`]? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg2}

* All distances should be measured in meters for this problem.
* All lengths of time should be measured in seconds for this problem.
