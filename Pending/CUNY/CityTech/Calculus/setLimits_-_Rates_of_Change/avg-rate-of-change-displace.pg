BEGIN_PGML

Guiding text suggestions:  
* can rates of change be negative
* distinguish between "distance travelled" and "displacement"
* "displacement" is change in position (can be + or -)
* direction is an important aspect of rates-of-change
* speed with direction is called _*velocity*_

[$im]***

A family is taking a day-trip to a famous landmark located [$distance] miles from their home. The trip to the landmark takes [$time1] hours. The family spends [$rest] hours at the landmark before returning home. The return trip takes [$time2] hours. 

1. What is the average velocity for their completed round-trip?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt}
    b. What is the displacement for this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy}
    c. What was the average velocity during this interval? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg}

1. What is the average velocity between [`t=[$t1start]`] and [`t=[$t1end]`]?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt1}
    b. What is the displacement for this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy1}
    c. What was the average velocity for [`[$t1start] \leq t \leq [$t1end]`]? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg1}

1. What is the average speed between [`t=[$t2start]`] and [`t=[$t2end]`]?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt2}
    b. What is the displacement for this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy2}
    c. What was the average velocity for [`[$t2start] \leq t \leq [$t2end]`]? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg2}

* All distances should be measured in miles for this problem.
* All lengths of time should be measured in hours for this problem.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
* moving farther from home _increases_ displacement (so the rate of change is positive)
* moving closer to home _decreases_ displacement (so the rate of change is negative)
