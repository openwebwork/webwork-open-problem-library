Guiding text suggestions:  
* Change in the value of a variable can be denoted with [`\Delta`]
* "Average rate of change" is essentially equivalent to "slope"
* UNITS

[$im]***

A family is taking a trip. During the first [$time1] hours, they travel at a rate of [$rate1] miles per hour. They then take a break for [$rest] hours and do not travel during that time. They finally travel again for another [$time2] hours at a rate of [$rate2] miles per hour before stopping for the day.

1. What is the average speed for their first day of travel?  
    a. How much time elapsed from the start of their trip until they stopped for the day? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt}
    b. How far did the family travel during their first day? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy}
    c. What was the average speed for their first day of travel? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg}

1. What is the average speed between [`t=[$t1start]`] and [`t=[$t1end]`]?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt1}
    b. How far did the family travel during this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy1}
    c. What was the average speed for [`[$t1start]\leq t \leq [$t1end]`]? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg1}

1. What is the average speed between [`t=[$t2start]`] and [`t=[$t2end]`]?  
    a. How much time elapsed? [`\Delta t = `] [________]{$dt2}
    b. How far did the family travel during this interval? [` \Delta y = `] [________]{$dy2}
    c. What was the average speed for [`[$t2start]\leq t \leq [$t2end]`]? [` \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = `] [________]{$avg2}

* All distances should be measured in miles for this problem.
* All lengths of time should be measured in hours for this problem.
