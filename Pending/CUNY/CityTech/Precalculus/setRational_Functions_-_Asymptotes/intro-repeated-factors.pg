>> ### Vertical Asymptote vs Hole ### <<

For the function [`f(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x-1}{x-1}}`], we'd like to say that this simplifies to being the same as [` f(x) = 1 `]; and we'd be _mostly_ correct, except for the fact that [` f(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x-1}{x-1}}`] is _undefined_ when [`x=1`]. However, for *every other* [`x`]-value (besides [`x=1`]), [`f(x) = 1`].

This gives us a graph that looks like:

>> [@ image( insertGraph($gr),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 ) @]* <<

What we should notice here is that _even though_ we have a "domain issue" at [` x = 1 `], we *don't* have a vertical asymptote. 

This can be recognized in _any_ function whose output looks like "[`\dfrac{0}{0}`]". Now we must realize that [`\dfrac{0}{0}`] is not a real number, and therefore does not constitute a valid output from our function. However, the appearance of [`\dfrac{0}{0}`] does tell us _something_ about our rational function.

When faced with a [`\dfrac{0}{0}`] situation, what we should realize is that this situation indicates that _both_ our numerator *and* our denominator have a common *root*. Furthermore, this common *root* indicates that our numerator and denominator share a *factor* (because every root gives us a factor and every factor gives us a root). And the presence of a common factor in our numerator and denominator tells us that we can _reduce_ our rational function (everywhere except at the root, because the [`\dfrac{0}{0}`] output is still undefined).



>> #### Practice #### <<

a. [`\displaystyle y = [$rational[$perm[0]]] `] has a domain issue at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]. Will there be a vertical asymptote at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]? [_]{$tf[$perm[0]]}

b. [` \displaystyle y = [$rational[$perm[1]]] `] has a domain issue at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]. Will there be a vertical asymptote at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]? [_]{$tf[$perm[1]]}

c. [` \displaystyle y = [$rational[$perm[2]]] `] has a domain issue at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]. Will there be a vertical asymptote at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]? [_]{$tf[$perm[2]]}

d. [` \displaystyle y = [$rational[$perm[3]]] `] has a domain issue at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]. Will there be a vertical asymptote at [`x = [$denomRoot]`]? [_]{$tf[$perm[3]]}

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

Attempt to evaluate each function at [`x = [$denomRoot]`].

Do you get a result that looks like [`\dfrac{0}{0}`]?

Or do you get a result that looks like a _non-zero_ value divided by zero?

What are the implications in each situation? 

Will you have a vertical asymptote or not?
