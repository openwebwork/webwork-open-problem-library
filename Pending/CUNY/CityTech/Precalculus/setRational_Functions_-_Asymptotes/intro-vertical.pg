>> ### Vertical Asymptotes ### <<

Because rational functions involve division, we must be careful in avoiding the input of any [`x`]-values that would cause division by [`0`].

For example, the function [`f(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{3}{x+1}}`] requires us to divide by a value which is one larger than the input value. In other words, we divide by [`x + 1`]. 

This will be problematic if we were to input a value of [`-1`] for [`x`], because [`f(-1) = \dfrac{3}{-1+1} = \dfrac{3}{0}`], which is undefined.

Since the input-value of [`x=-1`] does not have a corresponding output-value, we must exclude [`x=-1`] from the domain. 

In interval notation, the domain of [`f(x)`] is [`(-\infty,-1) \cup (-1, \infty)`].

Let us now consider the graph of [`f(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{3}{x+1}}`], and focus on the behavior of our graph for inputs close to [`x=-1`]:

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr1),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<

Because our function must avoid [`x=-1`], we have marked the corresponding vertical line with a dashed red line. You should see that as the input values get close to [`-1`], the function curves to approach this vertical line, [`x=-1`].

We describe this behavior as "_asymptotic_", and we refer to the line [`x=-1`] as a "_vertical asymptote_" of [`f(x)`].

This behavior emerges because we are attempting to divide [`3`] by values that are incredibly close to zero. 
* When [`x`] is very close to [`-1`], the denominator, [`x+1`], will be very close to zero. 
* For instance, if [`x = -0.99`], our denominator would be [`(-0.99 + 1)`] or [`0.01`].

When [`3`] is divided by a value close to zero, say [`0.01`], it will become much larger. 
* [`3 \div 0.01 = 300`]
* Think about what would happen if we were even closer to zero. 
* What if we divided [`3 \div 0.00001`]?

On the other side of [`x=-1`], our denominator will be negative-valued, but still close to zero. 
* What happens if we divide [`3 \div -0.00001`]?

>> ### Practice ### <<

* If you have more than one vertical asymptote, separate them using commas.

a. [`` f(x) = [$rational1] ``]

    What is (are) the vertical asymptote(s) of [`f(x)`]? [__________________]{$VA1->cmp()->withPostFilter($custom)}

b. [`` g(x) = [$rational2] ``]

    What is (are) the vertical asymptote(s) of [`g(x)`]? [__________________]{$VA2->cmp()->withPostFilter($custom)}

c. [`` h(x) = [$rational3] ``]

    What is (are) the vertical asymptote(s) of [`h(x)`]? [__________________]{$VA3->cmp()->withPostFilter($custom)}

* Think about the domain of your rational function.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. The rational function [`f(x)=\displaystyle[$rational1]`] is defined when [`x-[$denomRoot1]\neq 0`], that is, [`x\neq [$denomRoot1]`]. So the vertical asymptote is [`[$VA1]`].

b. The rational function [`g(x)=\displaystyle[$rational2]`] is defined when [`x-[$denomRoot2]\neq 0`], that is, [`x\neq [$denomRoot2]`]. So the vertical asymptote is [`x=[$denomRoot2]`].

c. The rational function [`h(x)=\displaystyle[$rational3]`] is defined when [`x^2+[$denomC]\neq 0`], that is, 

>>[`( x + [$denomRoot1])(x - [$denomRoot1])\neq 0`] <<

>>[`x\neq \displaystyle -[$denomRoot1]`] and [`x\neq  \displaystyle[$denomRoot1]`].<<

So the vertical asymptotes are [`x=-[$denomRoot1]`] and [`x=[$denomRoot1]`].
