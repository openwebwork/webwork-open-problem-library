>> ### Horizontal Asymptotes ### <<


Let's take a look at the graph of the rational function [`f(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{3x}{x+1}}`]:

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<

We already know that it has a vertical asymptote at [`x=-1`].

We can see that the tail behavior of the graph ''straightens'' out to the far right (large values of [`x`]) and far left (small values of [`x`]).

If we enlarge our window for the graph, we make a similar observation.

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr1),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<

In fact, what we are observing here comes from what we call a _horizontal asymptote_.

A _horizontal asymptote_ is a horizontal line that tells us that the tail graph of a rational function eventually ''looks straight''. 

In fact, the equation for the horizontal asymptote in the example above is [`y=3`].

We graph the horizontal asymptote (dotted red line) along with [`f(x)`] below:

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr2),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<

In general:
* How did we know whether a rational function has a horizontal asymptote or not?
* In case it does, how do we go about finding the equation of the asymptote?

To answer these questions, we need to think back about tail behavior of polynomial functions. 

Recall that the tail of a polynomial behaves as the polynomial's leading term. 

For instance, the tail of the graph of [`y=2x^2+x-3`] behaves as that of the graph of [`y=2x^2`]. 

In a way, this tells us that when [`x`] gets very large or very small in value, if we want to ''approximate'' the value of a polynomial, we only need to consider the value of its leading term and forget about the rest. This removes all the ''noise'' and allows us to focus on what is important.

Since a rational function is the ratio of two polynomials, when we discuss its tail behavior, we only need to consider the leading terms of its numerator and denominator.

We run into three cases:
* Degree of the leading terms of both numerator and denominator are the same. For example, [`f(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{3x}{x+1}}`] (from above). 

In this case, we have a horizontal asymptote and its equation is given by the ratio of the coefficients of the leading terms because both numerator and denominator grow at the same rate. 

This means, for [`f(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{3x}{x+1}}`], the equation for the horizontal asymptote is [`y=\displaystyle{\frac{3}{1}}=3`], which we had seen above.

* Degree of the leading terms of the numerator is less than that of the denominator. 
For example, [`g(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{x}{x^2+1}}`].

In this case, we have a horizontal asymptote and its equation is _always_ [`y=0`] ie the [`x`]-axis. 

This is because the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator.

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr3),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<



* Degree of the leading terms of the numerator is larger than that of the denominator. 
For example, [`h(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{x^2}{x+1}}`].

In this case, we _do not_ have a horizontal asymptote because the numerator grows at a faster rate than the denominator.

>> [@image( insertGraph($gr4),width=>400,height=>400,tex_size=>800 )@]* <<


### Note:

When we have a horizontal asymptote, its equation is always of the form [`y=`] constant. After all, it is a _horizontal line_.


>> ### Practice ### <<






Does [`\displaystyle y=[$rational1]`] have a horizontal asymptote? [_]{$tf1}

* If so, what is the horizontal asymptote? Otherwise, enter "none". [__________]{$HA1->cmp()->withPostFilter($custom)}

Does [`\displaystyle y=[$rational2]`] have a horizontal asymptote? [_]{$tf2}

* If so, what is the horizontal asymptote? Otherwise, enter "none". [__________]{$HA2->cmp()->withPostFilter($custom)}

Does [`\displaystyle y=[$rational3]`] have a horizontal asymptote? [_]{$tf3}

* If so, what is the horizontal asymptote? Otherwise, enter "none". [__________]{$HA3->cmp()->withPostFilter($customNone)}
