>> ### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ### <<

Let's look at [`f(x)=x^2-6x+9`]. Notice that when fully factored, [`f(x)=(x-3)^2`].

This polynomial has degree 2, but it only has one root. However, that root's factor appears _twice_ in the polynomial. 

When this happens, we say that the root has _multiplicity two_ -- because the factor appears twice.

What would it look like for [`x=3`] to be a root of multiplicity three? 

Our polynomial would have three factors of [`(x-3)`]; in other words, [`(x-3)(x-3)(x-3)`] or [`(x-3)^3`].

What if [`x=3`] is a root of multiplicity four? 

Now, let's look at [`g(x)=x^3-6x^2+9x`]. 

[`g(x)=x(x^2-6x+9)=x(x-3)^2`]. It has degree 3, and two roots, [`x=0`] and [`x=3`]. 

Let's read the multiplicity of each of these roots:

* The factor that corresponds to [`x=0`] appears once, so [`x=0`] has multiplicity 1.

* The factor that corresponds to [`x=3`] appears twice, so [`x=3`] has multiplicity 2.

Notice that when we add the _multiplicities_ of all the roots we get the degree of the polynomial, [`2+1=3`]. 

Recall how roots correspond to the graph intersecting the [`x`]-axis, and multiplicity corresponds to crossing (odd) or touching (even).

The graph of [`g(x)`] below is a good example:

>> #### Practice #### <<

Give an expression for [`f(x)`] of degree [$degree] with roots [` x = [$r1] `] and [` x = [$r2] `], where the root at [` x = [$r2] `] has multiplicity two.

    [`f(x) =`][____________________]{$ans->cmp(checker=>$checker)} is a polynomial of degree [$degree] with the given roots.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r1] `]?

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r2] `]?

* The root [` x = [$r2] `] has multiplicity two. This means that its corresponding factor must appear twice in the factorization of [`f(x)`].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The factors corresponding to the roots [`[$r1]`] and [`[$r2]`] are 
[`x-[$r1]`] and [`x-[$r2]`]. Since the multiplicity of [`[$r2]`] is two, its corresponding factor, [`x-[$r2]`], must appear twice in the factorization of [`f(x)`]. Moreover, recall that any constant factor ([`\neq 0`]) does not alter the roots of the polynomial. So any polynomial of the form [`c(x-[$r1])(x-[$r2])^2`], where [`c`] is a constant, satisfies the given conditions.  For example, by taking [`c=-5`], we obtain the polynomial [`f(x) =-5(x-[$r1])(x-[$r2])^2`] as a possible answer.
