>> ### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ### <<


Consider the polynomial [`f(x)=x^2-2x+10`]. It has degree two, so we expect that it should have two roots. But when we look at the graph we see that there are no [`x`]-intercepts. What is going on here?


>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object1), width=>400, height=>400, tex_size=>400)@]* <<


Since we can't factor [`f(x)`], let's use the quadratic formula to find the roots, that is, to solve [`f(x)=0`].

Recall that the quadratic formula deals with quadratic equations of the form [`ax^2+bx+c=0`]. So it is a perfect formula to use for [`\color{green}{x^2-2x+10}=0`]. Here [`a=1`], [`b=-2`] and [`c=10`].


The discriminant, [`\color{blue}{b^2-4ac}=(-2)^2-4(1)(10)=\color{blue}{-36}`]. The roots are then given by the quadratic formula:

>> [`x=\displaystyle{\frac{-b+\sqrt{\color{blue}{b^2-4ac}}}{2a}} \qquad`] and [`\qquad x=\displaystyle{\frac{-b-\sqrt{\color{blue}{b^2-4ac}}}{2a}}`]. <<

Notice that now we have to take the square root of a negative number, and thus we need to start considering complex numbers. 


Recall that [`i^2=-1`]. So, [`\color{blue}{b^2-4ac=-36=36i^2}`].

The roots for [`f(x)`] are:

>>[`x=\displaystyle{\frac{-(-2)+\sqrt{\color{blue}{-36}}}{2}}=\displaystyle{\frac{2+\sqrt{\color{blue}{36i^2}}}{2}}=\displaystyle{\frac{2+6i}{2}}= \color{red}{1+3i}`]<<

and 

>>[`x=\displaystyle{\frac{-(-2)-\sqrt{\color{blue}{-36}}}{2}}=\displaystyle{\frac{2-\sqrt{\color{blue}{36i^2}}}{2}}=\displaystyle{\frac{2-6i}{2}}=\color{magenta}{1-3i}`].<<

Notice that although our roots aren't real, we still have "as many" roots as we'd expect -- they just happen to be complex, and that's why our polynomial doesn't cross the [`x`]-axis. (Crossing the [`x`]-axis only happens at real roots).

Each of the roots that we found corresponds to a factor of [`f(x)`]. What do our factors look like?

For [`\color{red}{x=1+3i}`], the factor is [`\color{red}{[x-(1+3i)]}`].

For [`\color{magenta}{x=1-3i}`], the factor is [`\color{magenta}{[x-(1-3i)]}`]. 

We can rebuild [`f(x)`] by multiplying its factors:

>>[`\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \color{red}{[x-(1+3i)]}\color{magenta}{[x-(1-3i)]} \\
&= x^2-x(1-3i)-x(1+3i)+(1+3i)(1-3i)\\
&= x^2-x+3ix-x-3ix+1^2-3i+3i-(3i)^2 \\
&= x^2-2x+1-(-9)\\
&= \color{green}{x^2-2x+10}
\end{align*}
`]<<

Notice how the imaginary terms cancel out, leaving only real coefficients.

One more thing to note when working with the quadratic formula and a negative discriminant:
the [`i`] can only come from the radical, which always has a [`+`] or [`-`], so when the discriminant is negative, we get _two_ complex roots whose imaginary part only differs by [`+`] or [`-`] as follows: [`a+ib`] and [`a-ib`]. These complex numbers are called _conjugates_. 

In our example above, we saw the conjugates: [`\color{red}{1+3i}`] and [`\color{magenta}{1-3i}`]. 


 




>> #### Practice #### <<

Give an expression for [`f(x)`] of degree [$degree] with roots [` x = [$r1] `] , [` x = [$r2] `], and [` x = [$r3] `].

* Your final answer should not contain any [`i`]'s.

    [`f(x) =`][________________________]{$ans->cmp(checker=>$checker)} is a polynomial of degree [$degree] with the given roots.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The factors associated to the roots [`\color{magenta}{[$r1]}, \color{blue}{[$r2]}`] and [`\color{red}{[$r3]}`] are [`[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]`], [`[x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]`] and [`[x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})]`], respectively. By multiplying them out, we get:

>>
[`\begin{align*}
[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]\cdot [x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]\cdot [x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})] & = 
[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})] \cdot [x^2-([$r3])x-([$r2])x+([$r2])([$r3])]\\
&= (x-[$r1]) \cdot (x^2 +[$B]x+[$C]) \\
& = x^3 +[$B]x^2+[$C]x - [$r1]x^2 - [$r1]([$B])x - [$r1] ([$C]) \\
&= [$ans1] \\
&=\color{green}{[$ans2]}
\end{align*}
`]<<

Recall that a constant factor ([`\neq 0 `]) does not alter the roots of the polynomial. Hence, for any  non-zero constant [`c`], the polynomial [`f(x) = c(\color{green}{[$ans2]})`] satisfies the given conditions. 
For example, by taking [`c=10`], we obtain [`f(x) =10(\color{green}{[$ans2]})`] as a possible answer.
