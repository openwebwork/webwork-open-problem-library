>> ### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ### <<

A polynomial [`f(x)`] passes through the point [`(\color{red}{a},\color{blue}{b})`] if [`f(\color{red}{a})=\color{blue}{b}`].

For example, the polynomial [`f(x)=(x-3)(x^2+2x+10)`] passes through the point [`(\color{red}{-2},\color{blue}{-50})`] since [`f(\color{red}{-2})=\color{blue}{-50}`].

If we have an expression of a polynomial, for instance, [`f(x)=\color{brown}{c}(x^2-9)`], and we know that it passes through a point, say [`(\color{red}{1},\color{blue}{-40})`], then we can find the exact expression of [`f(x)`] by finding [`\color{brown}{c}`].

To find [`\color{brown}{c}`], we use the fact that [`f(\color{red}{1})=\color{blue}{-40}`]. Thus, 
>>[`\color{brown}{c}(\color{red}{1}^2-9)=\color{blue}{-40}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad -8\color{brown}{c} = -40 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \color{brown}{c=5}.`] <<
Finally, [`f(x)=\color{brown}{5}(x^2-9)`].



>> #### Practice #### <<

Give an expression for [`f(x)`] using _only_ Real-valued coefficients, having degree [$degree], passing through the point [` [$pt] `], with roots [` x = [$r1] `], [` x = [$r2] `], and [` x = [$r3] `].

* Your final answer should not contain any [`i`]'s.

    [`f(x) =`][________________________________________________]{$ans->cmp(checker=>$checker)} is a polynomial of degree [$degree] with the given roots and passes through [`[$pt]`].

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r1] `]?

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r2] `]?

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r3] `]?

* What is the degree of the polynomial obtained by multiplying these three factors out? Does the polynomial contain an [`i`]-term?

* What can you do to obtain a degree-4 polynomial with real coefficients, having [`[$r1]`], [`[$r2]`] and [`[$r3]`] as roots? Consider the conjugate of [`[$r3]`]. What is its corresponding factor?

* Consider a constant factor [`c`]. Write down [`f(x)`] as the product of [`c`] and the four factors.

* To find the value of [`c`], use that the graph of [`f(x)`] passes through
[` [$pt] `].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The factors associated to the roots [`\color{magenta}{[$r1]}, \color{blue}{[$r2]}`] and [`\color{red}{[$r3]}`] are [`[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]`], [`[x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]`] and [`[x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})]`], respectively. By multiplying them out, we get a polynomial of degree [`3`] with an [`i`]-term. We consider the conjugate of [`[$r3]`], which is [`\color{orange}{[$r4]}`]. Its corresponding factor is [`[x-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})]`]. Now we multiply the four factors to obtain a polynomial of degree 4 with all of its coefficients real.

>>
[`\begin{align*}
[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]\cdot [x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]\cdot [x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})] \cdot [x-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})] & = 
[x^2-([$r1])x-([$r2])x+([$r1])([$r2])] \cdot [x^2 + [$B] x + [$C]]\\
& = [x^2-([$r1]+[$r2])x+([$r1])([$r2])] \cdot [x^2 + [$B] x + [$C]]\\
&=  ([$ans1])\cdot (x^2 +[$B]x+[$C]) \\
&= \color{green}{[$ans2]} 
\end{align*}
`]<<

Since constant factors ([`\neq 0`]) do not alter the roots of the polynomial, for any non-zero constant [`\color{brown}{c}`], the polynomial 
>>[`f(x) = \color{brown}{c}\cdot[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]\cdot [x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]\cdot [x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})] \cdot [x-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})]`] <<
or
>>[`f(x) = \color{brown}{c}\cdot(\color{green}{[$ans2]})`] <<
satisfies the given conditions. We know 
that the graph of [`f(x)`] passes through
[` [$pt] `]. This means that [`f([$x])=[$y]`].

>>[`\begin{align*}
f([$x]) & = \color{brown}{c}[[$x]-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]\cdot [[$x]-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]\cdot [[$x]-(\color{red}{[$r3]})] \cdot [[$x]-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})] \\
[$y] & = \color{brown}{c} \cdot ([@Formula("$x - $r1")->reduce; @])
\cdot ([@Formula("$x - $r2")->reduce; @]) \cdot [([$x])^2 + [$B] \cdot ([$x]) + [$C]] \\
[$y] & = \color{brown}{c} \cdot ([@Formula("$x - $r1")->reduce; @])
\cdot ([@Formula("$x - $r2")->reduce; @]) \cdot ([@Formula(" [($x)^2 + $B * $x + $C]")->reduce; @]) \\
[$y] & = \color{brown}{c} \cdot ([@Formula("($x - $r1)*($x - $r2)*(($x)^2 + $B*$x+$C)")->reduce; @]) \\
([@Formula("($x - $r1)*($x - $r2)*(($x)^2 + $B*$x+$C)")->reduce; @])\cdot \color{brown}{c} &= [$y] \\
\color{brown}{c} &=  [$k] 
\end{align*}`] 
<<

Therefore, the polynomial is 
>> [`f(x) = \color{brown}{[$k]}\cdot[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]\cdot [x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]\cdot [x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})] \cdot [x-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})]`]<<
or
>>[`f(x) = \color{brown}{[$k]}\cdot(\color{green}{[$ans2]})`]. <<
