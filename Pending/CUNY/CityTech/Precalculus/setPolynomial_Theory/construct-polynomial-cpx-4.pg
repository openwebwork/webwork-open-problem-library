>> ### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ### <<


Recall that if a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root [`\color{blue}{a+bi}`], then the complex conjugate [`\color{red}{a-bi}`] is also a root.

For example, if a polynomial [`f(x)`] with real coefficients has a root [`x=-4+2i`] then it also has a root [`x=-4-2i`].


* When working with complex conjugates, it is useful to realize that [`(\color{blue}{a+bi})(\color{red}{a-bi})=a^2-(bi)^2=a^2+b^2 `].


* Moreover, multiplying factors that correspond to conjugate roots always eliminates the [`i`]'s as follows:

>>[`\begin{align*}
[x-(\color{blue}{a+bi})]\cdot [x-(\color{red}{a-bi})] & =x^2-(a-bi)x-(a+bi)x+(a+bi)(a-bi) \\
& =x^2-ax+bix-ax-bix+a^2+b^2 \\
&=x^2-2ax+a^2+b^2,
\end{align*}`]
<<

and the [`i`]-terms always cancel out. 



>> #### Practice #### <<

Give an expression for [`f(x)`] using _only_ real-valued coefficients, having degree [$degree], and roots [` x = [$r1] `] , [` x = [$r2] `], and [` x = [$r3] `].

* Your final answer should not contain any [`i`]'s.

    [`f(x) =`][____________________]{$ans->cmp(checker=>$checker)} is a polynomial of degree [$degree] with the given roots.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r1] `]?

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`[$r2] `]?

* Which factor corresponds to the root [`([$r3]) `]?

* What is the degree of the polynomial obtained by multiplying these three factors out?

* What can you do to obtain a degree-4 polynomial satisfying the given conditions? Consider the conjugate of [`[$r3]`].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The factors associated to the roots [`\color{magenta}{[$r1]}, \color{blue}{[$r2]}`] and [`\color{red}{[$r3]}`] are [`[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]`], [`[x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]`] and [`[x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})]`], respectively. By multiplying them out, we get a polynomial of degree [`3`] with an [`i`]-term. We consider the conjugate of [`[$r3]`], which is [`\color{orange}{[$r4]}`]. Its corresponding factor is [`[x-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})]`]. Now we multiply the four factors to obtain a polynomial of degree 4 with all of its coefficients real.

>>
[`\begin{align*}
[x-(\color{magenta}{[$r1]})]\cdot [x-(\color{blue}{[$r2]})]\cdot [x-(\color{red}{[$r3]})] \cdot [x-(\color{orange}{[$r4]})] & = 
[x^2-([$r1])x-([$r2])x+([$r1])([$r2])] \cdot [x^2 + [$B] x + [$C]]\\
& = [x^2-([$r1]+[$r2])x+([$r1])([$r2])] \cdot [x^2 + [$B] x + [$C]]\\
&=  ([$ans1])\cdot (x^2 +[$B]x+[$C]) \\
&= \color{green}{[$ans2]} 
\end{align*}
`]<<

Since constant factors ([`\neq 0`]) do not alter the roots of the polynomial, for any non-zero constant [`c`], the polynomial [`f(x) = c(\color{green}{[$ans2]})`] satisfies the given conditions. 
For example, by taking [`c=10`], we obtain [`f(x) =10(\color{green}{[$ans2]})`] as a possible answer.
