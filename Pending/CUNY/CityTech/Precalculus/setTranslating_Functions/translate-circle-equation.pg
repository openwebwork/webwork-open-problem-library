Give an equation for the result of shifting the graph of [` [$f] = [@$r**2@] `] [@ ($k > 0)?"up":"down" @] by [@abs($k)@] [@ (abs($k) == 1)?"unit":"units" @], and [@ ($h > 0)?"right":"left" @] by [@abs($h)@] [@ (abs($h) == 1)?"unit":"units" @].


* An *equation* is written as two expressions connected by the equal sign.

Enter an equation for the shifted graph:[`\quad`][_____________________________]

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

* What does the graph of [` [$f] = [@$r**2@] `] look like?

* What characteristics of the graph will change because of the shift? 

* What characteristics of the graph will remain the same?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The graph of [` [$f] = [@$r**2@] `] is a circle of radius [`r=[$r]`] centered at [`(0,0)`].  

Shifting the graph [@ ($k > 0)?"up":"down" @] by [@abs($k)@] [@ (abs($k) == 1)?"unit":"units" @] and [@ ($h > 0)?"right":"left" @] by [@abs($h)@] [@ (abs($h) == 1)?"unit":"units" @] shifts the center of the circle to [`([$h],[$k])`] (and leaves the radius the same).

So the shifted graph will be a circle centered at [`(h,k) = ([$h],[$k])`] with radius [`r=[$r]`].  

An equation for such a circle is [`(x-[$h])^2 + (y-[$k])^2 = [@$r**2@] `].

Another way to see this is that shifting the graph [@ ($k > 0)?"up":"down" @] by [@abs($k)@] [@ (abs($k) == 1)?"unit":"units" @] happens when we replace "[`y`]" with "[`y-[$k]`]", and shifting the graph [@ ($h > 0)?"right":"left" @] by [@abs($h)@] [@ (abs($h) == 1)?"unit":"units" @] happens when we replace "[`x`]" with "[`x-[$h]`]".

So our equation [` [$f] = [@$r**2@] `] becomes [`(x-[$h])^2 + (y-[$k])^2 = [@$r**2@] `].
