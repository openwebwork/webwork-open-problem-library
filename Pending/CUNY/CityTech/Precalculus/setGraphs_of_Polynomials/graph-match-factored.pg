>> ### Graphs of Polynomials ### <<

What can the equation of a polynomial tell us about its graph? More specifically, what can the factored form of a polynomial tell us about its crossings with the [`x`]-axis?

We look at polynomials that are completely factored. 

Consider [`f(x)=(x-2)(x+1)`]. Its factors of are [`(x-2)`] and [`(x+1)`]. The roots are [`x=2`] and [`x=-1`]. 

Let us look at the graph of [`f(x)`]: 


>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object1), width=>200, height=>200, tex_size=>400)@]* <<



We can see that it crosses the [`x`]-axis at [`x=2`] and [`x=-1`], exactly the roots of [`f(x)`].


Recall that the roots of a function [`f(x)`] are the solutions of the equation [`f(x)=0`]. As we have seen, we use the notation [`f(x)`] instead of using the dependent variable [`y`]. This means that the roots of a function are exactly the points that have [`y=0`] or [`0`] for their [`y`]-coordinate. This is why, when we look at the graph of a function [`f(x)`], the roots are exactly the points where [`f(x)`] intersects the [`x`]-axis, as can be seen from the example above.

What about [`f(x)=(x-5)(x+1)(x-3)`]? 

The factors of [`f(x)`] are [`(x-5)`], [`(x+1)`] and [`(x-3)`]. The roots are [`x=5`], [`x=-1`] and [`x=3`]. Without looking at the graph, we can say that the polynomial will cross the [`x`]-axis three times at [`x=5`], [`x=-1`] and [`x=3`]. We can confirm that by looking at the graph:

>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object2), width=>200, height=>200, tex_size=>400)@]* <<


We can also work reversely and read off the roots of a polynomial from its graph. 

For example, look at the following graph:


>> [@image(insertGraph($graph_object3), width=>200, height=>200, tex_size=>400)@]* <<


Even though we are not given the expression of the polynomial, we can see that the given graph crosses the [`x`]-axis at [`x=-2`], [`x=-1`] and [`x=5`] and thus we can deduce that these are roots of the polynomial. 


>> ### Practice ### <<

Match the equations given below with their corresponding graphs:
