$PAR
An inverted cylindrical cone, $h0 ft deep and $r0
ft across at the top, is being filled with water at
a rate of $rate ft<SUP>3</SUP>/min.  At what rate is

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR
We will need to have a formula for volume of
the water inside the cone.  Let \(h\) be the
depth of water at any given time, and \(r\) be
the radius of the cone formed by the water.  (Note,
\(h\) and \(r\) do $BBOLD not$EBOLD refer to the height or
radius of the container cone.)

By a similar triangles argument, \(r = \frac{1}{4}h\).
Therefore, the volume of the water (which is in the
shape of a cone) is:
\[
  V = \dfrac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \dfrac{1}{3} \pi
  \left( \dfrac{1}{4} h\right)^2 h = \dfrac{\pi}{48}h^3.
\]
$PAR
The goal is to find \( \dfrac{dh}{dt} \).
Take time-derivatives of both sides of the
equation.  
\[
  \dfrac{dV}{dt} = \dfrac{\pi}{16} h^2 \dfrac{dh}{dt}.
\]
$PAR
Then plug in \( \dfrac{dV}{dt} = $rate\) and solve for
the unknown rate.
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    $rate &=& \dfrac{\pi}{16} h^2 \dfrac{dh}{dt} \\
    &&\\
    \dfrac{dh}{dt} &=& \dfrac{$num}{\pi h^2}
  \end{array}
\]
$PAR
When \(h = 1\),
\[
  \dfrac{dh}{dt} = \dfrac{$num}{\pi (1)^2} \approx $r1
\]
$PAR
When \(h = 10\),
\[
  \dfrac{dh}{dt} = \dfrac{$num}{\pi (10)^2} \approx $r2
\]
$PAR
When \(h = $h3\),
\[
  \dfrac{dh}{dt} = \dfrac{$num}{\pi ($h3)^2} \approx $r3
\]
