BEGIN_TEXT

You have two alarm clocks. The first one is successful $p1% of the time
and the second one is successful $p2% of the time (it turns out your second
one was actually less reliable than the first).
$PAR

(a) Suppose you only remember to set the good alarm clock. What is the
probability that it will succeed on the morning of an important exam?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) Suppose you set both alarm clocks. What is the probability that at least
one of them is successful on the morning of an important exam?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) This practice of using a second device is called redundancy. Was there a
significant increase in the probability of getting to the exam obtained
using the second alarm clock?
$BR
