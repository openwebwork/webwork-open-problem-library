BEGIN_TEXT

A pregnancy testing device is used by $n different women from a population
of women who think they might be pregnant. The results are depicted in the
contingency table below.  Here, a positive test result means pregnancy is
detected.
$PAR

\{
DataTable(
  [
    ['', ['Was the woman actually pregnant?', colspan => 2]],
    [['', midrule=>1], 'Yes', 'No'],
    ['positive test result', $yes_yes, $yes_no],
    ['negative test result', $no_yes, $no_no],
  ], 
);
\}
$PAR

(a) Using the relative frequency approximation of probabilities, what is the
probability that the device is correct?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) Suppose you are a woman about to take the test. Prior to taking the
test, what is the probability of a false-positive?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Suppose you are a woman who takes the test and it comes back positive.
Now, what is the probability that the test result is wrong?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(d) Comment on the difference between your answer to part (b) and your
answer to part (c).
$PAR

After getting a positive test result, the probability of a false-positive
is __________ that prior to taking the test.
$BR
