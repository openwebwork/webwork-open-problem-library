Of the reported $accidents car accidents in Stevens County last year,
$one_mile of them occurred within 1 mile of the person's home.
$PAR

(a) If one of the reported car accidents is randomly selected, what is the
probability that it occurred within 1 mile of the person's home?
$BR

(b) Estimate the probability that the next reported car accident in Stevens
County will be within 1 mile of the person's home?
