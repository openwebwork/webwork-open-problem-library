BEGIN_TEXT

Assume that $p% of all car owners have jumper-cables in the car. You are
stranded in a parking lot with a dead battery and there are $n other people
getting into different cars nearby.
$PAR
(a) What is the probability that all $n people have jumper-cables in the
car?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) What is the probability that at least one of the $n people have
jumper-cables in the car?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Which probability is more relevant to your current situation?
$BR
\{$c->buttons()\}
