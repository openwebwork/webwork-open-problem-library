BEGIN_TEXT

You enter a lottery by purchasing one of the $n tickets. There is one grand
prize winner, $second second prize winners, and $small small prize winners.
These are selected at random (without replacement) from a bin containing all
the tickets.
$PAR

(a) What is the probability that you will win the grand prize?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) What is the probability that you will win a prize of some type?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
