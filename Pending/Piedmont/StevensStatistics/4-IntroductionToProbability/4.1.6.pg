BEGIN_TEXT

A life insurance company wants to estimate the probability that a 40 year
old male will live through the next year. In a random sample of $men such
men, $lived lived through the year.  Using the relative frequency
approximation, what is the probability that a randomly selected 40 year
old male will die within a year?
