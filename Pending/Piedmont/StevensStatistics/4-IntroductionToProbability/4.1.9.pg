BEGIN_TEXT

The table below indicates the accuracy of a local weather report with
respect to rain or no rain over the past year. This table gives the results
of 365 consecutive days and compares whether it rained or not to whether or
not rain was predicted.
$PAR

\{
DataTable(
  [
    ['', ['Did it actually rain?', colspan => 2]],
    [['', midrule=>1], 'Yes', 'No'],
    ['Report Predicted Rain', $yes_yes, $yes_no],
    ['Report Predicted No Rain', $no_yes, $no_no],
  ], 
);
\}
$PAR

(a) How many times was the prediction correct?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
How many times was it wrong?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) If one day is randomly selected from last year, what is the probability
that the prediction was correct?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Tomorrow, the same local weather report will be given. Estimate the probability that it will be correct with respect to rain or no rain.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
