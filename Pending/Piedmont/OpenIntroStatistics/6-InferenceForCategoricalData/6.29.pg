BEGIN_TEXT

A 2010 survey asked $n randomly sampled registered voters in California "Do you support? Or do you oppose? Drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California? Or do you not know enough to say?" Below is the distribution of responses, separated based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college
$PAR

(a) What percent of college graduates in this sample do not know enough to have an opinion on drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California?

(b) What percent of the non-college graduates in this sample do not know enough to have an opinion on drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California?

$PAR

Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the data provide strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have an opinion on this issue is different than that of non-college graduates.  Test this claim at the 0.05 significance level.
$PAR

(c) Find the test statistic.  The standard error is $se.
$BR

$PAR

(d) Find the positive critical value.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(e) Find the negative critical value.
$BR

$PAR

(f) Find the \(p\)-value.

(g) Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
