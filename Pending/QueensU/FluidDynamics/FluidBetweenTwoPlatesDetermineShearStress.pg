BEGIN_PGML

Glycerin ([`\rho = 1260`] [`kg/m^{3}`], [`\mu = 1.5`] [`Ns/m^{_{2}}`]), with a depth of [`h = [$h]`] [`cm`] lies between two plates. A force is applied to the top plate to give it a constant horizontal velocity of [`V = [$V]`] [`m/s`], and the lower plate is fixed.

Determine the shear stress that is present in the fluid.

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(1.5*$V/$h*100, reltol => 2, ));
