BEGIN_PGML

Many small towns supply their citizens with water from a water tower. The height of the tower is used to provide sufficient head for many households and small businesses. For this particular tower a water main pipe of [`20`][`''`] SCH 40, commercial steel piping is used. The entry to the pipe in the tower has a well-rounded configuration, and a regular, [`90^{\circ}`] flanged bend is placed at the bottom of the tower. The height of water in the tower is [`h = [$h]`] [`m`], and the water must travel through [`[$L]`] [`m`] of water main pipeline before branching into smaller supply pipes.

[@ image('WaterTowerDetermineFlowRate.png', width=>617, height=>314) @]*

In order to provide adequate supply flow to the branch lines, a minimum pressure head of [`[$ph]`] [`m`] are required at the end of the water main line.What is the maximum allowable volumetric flow rate, [`Q`], through the water main pipeline?



Discussion: What changes can be made to the system that will allow the water tower to supply a larger flow rate of water to the town?

[`Q=`][____] [`m^{3}/s`]

_Hint:Friction factor should be around 0.0125. You will need to solve iteratively to find this._

ANS(num_cmp(pi*(0.4929/2)**2*sqrt(($h-$ph)*(2*9.81/(0.0125*$L/0.4929+0.34+1))), reltol => 5, ));
