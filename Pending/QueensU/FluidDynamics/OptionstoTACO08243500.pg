BEGIN_PGML

Your facility already includes multiple TACO TA 0824 pumps, so using the same pump for a new application has many advantages in terms of spares and maintenance costs. The new application has a design flow of [`0.05`] [`m^3/s`] and a head of [`65`] [`m`] pumping water at [`20^{\circ}C`].

The TA 0824 running at [`3500`] [`RPM`] appears to be in the right range. (Look towards the end of the curve book.)

Your supervisor suggests looking at pumps running at slower speeds to improve efficiency, operating lifetime and maintenance costs. Which of these pumps operating at [`1760`] [`RPM`] would be a reasonable alternative to the TA0824 at [`3500`] [`RPM`]?
