BEGIN_PGML

A siphoning tube is used to empty water from a cup. To initiate the flow in the siphon a pipette is used to draw water through the tube of constant internal diameter. The surrounding environment is held at atmospheric pressure.

[@ image('SiphonHowFarMustthePipetteMovetheWater.png', width=>260, height=>374) @]*

Refer to the labelled locations on the diagram. How far must water be drawn through the siphoning tube by the pipette before it will continue to flow, unassisted?  
[@ $mc->buttons() @]*

END_PGML

ANS($mc->cmp());
