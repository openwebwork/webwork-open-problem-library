BEGIN_PGML

Small particles in air are difficult to study because of the scale of the flow. If a particle has a diameter of [`[$Dp]`] [`mm`] and a velocity of [`[$Vp]`] [`cm`] per second in [`20^{\circ}C`] atmospheric air, what would be the dynamically similar velocity for a [`[$Dm]`] [`cm`] particle in glycerin at [`20^{\circ}C`]?

Assume the velocities are low, making Weber Number small, so that the drops don't deform noticeably.

[`V_{glycerin}=`][____] [`m/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(($Dp / 1000.) / ($Dm / 100.) * 0.00119/ 0.000015 * $Vp/100., reltol => 5, ));
