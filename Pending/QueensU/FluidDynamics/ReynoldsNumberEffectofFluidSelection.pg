BEGIN_PGML

We must choose a fluid that will flow with a velocity of [`0.5`] [`m/s`] over an immersed body of known geometry. Select the fluids below in ascending order of the resulting Reynolds number (selection [`1`] will result in the lowest Reynolds number).

[____]{3}Seawater  
[____]{4}Distilled Water  
[____]{2}Air  
[____]{5}Mercury  
[____]{1}Glycerin
