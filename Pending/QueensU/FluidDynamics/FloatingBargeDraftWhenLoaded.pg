BEGIN_PGML

A small, rectangular barge floating on water is used to carry *seven masses* of [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`] each, and the barge itself has a mass of [`15000`] [`kg`]. The bottom of the barge has dimensions of [`l = [$l]  \times w = [$w]`] [`m`] and is deep enough to avoid sinking.

[@ image('FloatingBargeDraftWhenLoaded.png', width=>660, height=>368) @]*

Determine the depth [`d`], that the bottom of the barge rests below the surface of the water.

Discussion: Draw a free body diagram identifying all forces acting on the barge. Which are point forces and which are distributed? How would the differences affect your structural design of the barge? (Thought experiment: what would happen to a birch bark canoe if you concentrated the weight of all the passengers at a single point in the centre?)

ANS(num_cmp((15000+7*$m)/(998*$l*$w), reltol => 2, ));
