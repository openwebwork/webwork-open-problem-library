BEGIN_PGML

Water is draining from a conical funnel oh height [`H = [$H]`] [`cm`]. The maximum diameter of the funnel is [`D = [$D]`] [`cm`], and the minimum diameter is [`d = [$d]`] [`cm`] at the bottom of the funnel. The flow of water exits through a well-rounded orifice. Find an expression for the volumetric flow rate in terms of [`h(t)`]. How long will it take for [`h`] to change from [`[$H]`] [`cm`] to [`[$h2]`] [`cm`]? Express your answer to 2 decimal places.
