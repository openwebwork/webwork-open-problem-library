BEGIN_PGML

You want a flow of [`[$Q]`] cubic metres per second through the pipe to meet design specifications. The piping system is as shown, consisting of [`[$L] metres of [`4`] inch schedule 40 commercial steel pipe with long radius, flanged elbows and a globe valve. What is elevation difference required between the Lake on the Mountain and the pipe exit?

[`H=`][____] [`m`]

_Hint:Although I won't say which is which, I included minor loss coefficients of 0.2, 0.8, 1.0, and 10.0 in my answer to the question.If your friction factor was a lot different than 0.017 you should probably check your work._
