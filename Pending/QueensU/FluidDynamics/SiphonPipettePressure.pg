BEGIN_PGML

A siphoning tube is used to empty water from a cup. To initiate the flow in the siphon a pipette is used to draw water through the tube of constant internal diameter. The surrounding environment is held at atmospheric pressure.

[@ image('SiphonPipettePressure.png', width=>293, height=>421) @]*

In order to hold water in the tube at height [`h_{1} = [$h1]`] [`cm`],  as depicted in the figure, what pressure must be induced by the pipette?

[`P=`][____] [`kPa`]
