BEGIN_PGML

Glycerin ([`\rho = 1260`] [`kg/m^{3}`], [`\mu = 1.5`] [`Ns/m^{_{2}}`]), with a depth of [`h = [$h]`] [`cm`] lies between two plates. A force is applied to the top plate to give it a constant horizontal velocity of [`V = [$V]`] [`m/s`], and the lower plate is fixed.

[@ image('FluidBetweenTwoPlatesEffectofFluidChangeonAppliedForce.png', width=>786, height=>276) @]*

Suppose that the glycerin is replaced with water ([`\rho = 998`] [`kg/m^{3}`], [`\mu = 1.12*10^{-3}`] [`Ns/m^{_{2}}`]), but all other geometry of the system remains constant. In order to pull the top plate with the same velocity [`V`], what percentage of the original applied force will be required.
