BEGIN_PGML

Water at [`20^{\circ}C`] degrees celsius flows, under pressure, between two plates a distance, [`h`], apart. The flow is fully developed and laminar. The pressure gradient in the [`x`] direction is constant, and the pressure gradient in the [`y`] direction is [`0`].

[@ image('WaterFlowBetweenTwoPlatesValidAssumptions.png', width=>794, height=>301) @]*

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, written below, for [`x`]-momentum may be applied to this system:

[`\partial u/\partial t +u \partial u/\partial x + v\partial u/\partial y +w \partial u/\partial z = -1/\rho\cdot\partial P/\partial x + g_x +\nu \partial ^2u/\partial x^2 +\nu \partial ^2u/\partial y^2 +\nu \partial ^2u/\partial z^2`]

Counting the terms from from left to right, making [`\frac{dv}{dt}`] term 1. Select all assumptions that are valid for this this system, and the term of Navier-Stokes which we can subsequently eliminate.
