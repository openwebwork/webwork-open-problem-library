BEGIN_PGML

The pilot project piping system to the power plant is as shown, consisting of  welded [`6`] [`inch`] schedule 40 pipe, elbows and a valve. The elevation difference between the Lake on the Mountain and the pipe exit resulted in a measured flow rate of [`0.05`] cubic metres per second.

If we want to build a larger scale project for a flow rate of [`0.18`] cubic metres per second, estimate the required pipe size.
