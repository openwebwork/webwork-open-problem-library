$mc = RadioButtons(
	["It allows us to assume fluid mass and momentum is conserved", "It allows us to assume the kinematic viscosity of a fluid, \(\nu\), is independent of shear rate.", "It allows us to ignore interactions between molecules/atoms.", "It allows us to assume that the fluid can be treated like water at standard conditions.", "It allows us to assume the density of a fluid, \(\rho\), is constant."],
	"It allows us to assume the density of a fluid, \(\rho\), is constant."
);

BEGIN_PGML

Throughout this course we will usually assume a fluid is *Incompressible*. How does this assumption simplify the properties of a fluid?
