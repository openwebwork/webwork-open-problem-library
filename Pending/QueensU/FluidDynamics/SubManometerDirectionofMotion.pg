The submersible shown in the diagram is horizontal at a depth of [`15`] metres below the surface in Lake Ontario. A tube is filled with lake water and open to the exterior through a port in the centre of the front of the submersible and open to the exterior through a port in the side of the hull, with a manometer connected in between as shown.
