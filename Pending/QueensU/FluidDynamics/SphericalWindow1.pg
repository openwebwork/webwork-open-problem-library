BEGIN_PGML

A hemispherical window (half of a sphere) is installed in a vertical wall (vertical, despite my drawing) on the side of a tank filled with water ([`\rho  = 1000`] [`kg/m^3`]). The diameter of the hemisphere is [`d = [$d]`] [`m`] while the top of the window is located at a depth of [`D =  [$D]`] [`m`].  Calculate the horizontal force acting on the window.

ANS(num_cmp(1000*9.81*($D+$d*2/3)*3.14*$d**2/4, reltol => 2, ));
