[`{\partial v \over \partial t} +u {\partial v \over \partial x}+v{\partial v \over \partial y}+w{\partial v \over \partial z} = -{1 \over \rho}{\partial P \over \partial z}+g_z+\nu ( {\partial^2 v \over \partial x^2}+{\partial^2 v \over \partial y^2}+{\partial^2 v \over \partial z^2})`]

This equation has 9 terms, 4 on the left side and 5 on the right side, so that [`gz`] is term number 6. Which terms could you eliminate for a flow over a wing with an extremely high Reynolds number?
