BEGIN_PGML

Assume that the tank in the picture is large, with circular jets of diameters [`D_{1} = [$d1]`] [`cm`] and 

[`D_{2} = [$d2]`] [`cm`], and heights [`H_1 = [$h1]`] metres and [`H_2 =[$h2]`] metres.

[@ image('2Orifice2VelocityofSecondJet.png', width=>203, height=>253) @]*

Find the velocity [`U_2`].

[`U_2=`] [____] [`m/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp((2*9.8*($h1+$h2))**.5, reltol => 3, ));
