BEGIN_PGML

Water flowing in a small channel is partially impeded by a plate held in place by force [`F`]. The water approaches the plate with a velocity of [`V_{1}= [$V1]`] [`m/s`] and a depth of [`h_{1} = [$h1]`] [`m`]. The angle of the gate, relative to the vertical,  is [`\theta = [$th]^{\circ}`]. The channel has a constant width of [`w = 0.5`] [`m`]. The plate has a length of [`l = 1.8`] [`m`].  Assume that the height at the exit of the gate, [`h_{2}`], is approximately equal to the distance between the bottom of the gate and the bottom of the river, [`d`].  

[@ image('PlateBlockingChannelCalculateReactionForce.png', width=>851, height=>277) @]*

Determine the *horizontal reaction force* that must be sustained by the plate. Ignore frictional force between the water and the channel bed.

Discussion:Assuming that [`h_{2}`] does not change significantly, how does a change in [`\theta`] affect the required force, F? How does length l affect F?

Is the pressure distribution on the plate constant?
