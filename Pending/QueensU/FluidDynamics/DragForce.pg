BEGIN_PGML

The Drag Coefficient on a sphere is [`[$Cd]`].  Calculate the drag force on a sphere of diameter [`[$D]`] [`m`] in air at atmospheric conditions ([`\rho=1.2`] [`kg/m^3`] and [`\mu = 1.8\cdot 10^{-5}`] [`Pa\cdot s`] ) for a Reynolds number of [`[$Re]`]. Express your answer in [`N`], to 4 decimals places.

[`F_D=`][____] [`N`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp($Cd*0.5*(1.2)*($Re*(0.000018)/1.2)**2*pi/4, reltol => 2, ));
