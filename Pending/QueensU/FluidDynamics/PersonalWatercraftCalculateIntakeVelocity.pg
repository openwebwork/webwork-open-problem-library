BEGIN_PGML

A personal watercraft, depicted in figure *(a)*, is driven along a lake.

[@ image('PersonalWatercraftCalculateIntakeVelocity1.png', width=>355, height=>194) @]*  
Figure *(a)*

Figure *(b)* is a diagram of the watercraft's propulsion system. The intake of the system has a cross-sectional area of [`A_{1}= [$A1]`] [`m^{2}`] which is at an angle of [`\theta = [$th]^{\circ}`] from the horizontal. The output nozzle is horizontal and has a cross-sectional area of [`A_{2}= [$A2]`] [`m^{2}`].

[@ image('PersonalWatercraftCalculateIntakeVelocity2.png', width=>793, height=>219) @]*  
Figure *(b)*

A sensor attached to the impeller shaft indicates that [`[$T] N`] of thrust is produced. Determine the velocity of the water at the the intake, [`V_{1}`].



Discussion: Providing that the same thrust, [`T`], must be maintained, how does change to the angle [`\theta`] affect the required intake velocity?

What changes could you make to the watercraft's geometry to increase the attainable thrust?



[`V_{1}=`][____] [`m/s`]
