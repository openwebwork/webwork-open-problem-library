BEGIN_PGML

Water flows in a [`2"`] Schedule 40 pipe with a Venturi flow meter and a mercury manometer included as shown to measure the flow rate. The diameter of the Venturi tube is [`d = [$d]`] [`cm`]. If the manometer height [`h = [$h]`] [`cm`], what is the volumetric flow rate, [`Q`]?

Discussion:

What assumptions are necessary to complete the calculation?

Although they are the same size in this diagram, the downstream, diverging section of a Venturi meter is often much longer than the upstream, converging section in practical meters. Why?  

[`Q=`][____] [`m^{3}/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(pi*(52.5/(2*1000))**2*sqrt((2*(13530-998)*9.81*$h/100)/(((52.5/10/$d)**4-1)*998)), reltol => 3, ));
