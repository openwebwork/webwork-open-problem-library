BEGIN_PGML

A hydraulic force amplification device is used to lift a mass of [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`] that sits on a piston with an area of [`A_{2} = [$A2]`] [`m^{2}`]. The mass is supported by applying a force, [`F`], at a piston with an area [`A_{1} = [$A1]`] [`m^2`]. 

[@ image('ForceAmplifierMotionRatio.png', width=>579, height=>316) @]*

If piston [`1`] is compressed a distance of [`[$d]`] [`m`], how far will piston [`2`] move?





[`d=`][____] [`m`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp($d*$A1/$A2, reltol => 3, ));
