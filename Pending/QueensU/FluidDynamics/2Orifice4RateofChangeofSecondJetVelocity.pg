BEGIN_PGML

Assume that the tank in the picture is large, with circular jets of diameters [`D_{1} = [$d1]`] [`cm`] and 

 [`D_{2} = [$d2]`] [`cm`], and heights [`H_1 = [$h1]`] metres and [`H_2 =[$h2]`] metres.

[@ image('2Orifice4RateofChangeofSecondJetVelocity.png', width=>203, height=>253) @]*


If the cross-sectional area of the tank is [`1`] [`m^{2}`] from the top down to location [`1`], then drops linearly to [`0.4 `] [`m^{2}`] at location [`2`], what is the value of [`\frac{dU_{2}}{dt}`], the rate of change of [`U_{2}`], when the depth is as indicated?

[`\frac{dU_{2}}{dt}=`][____] [`m/s^2`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(-pi*9.81*(($d1/100)**2*($h1)**.5+($d2/100)**2*($h1+$h2)**.5)/(4*($h1+$h2)**.5), reltol => 3, ));
