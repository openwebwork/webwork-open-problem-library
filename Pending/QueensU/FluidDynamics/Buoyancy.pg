BEGIN_PGML

A submarine is floating (zero velocity) in equilibrium and is fully submerged in the ocean.  A small leak in the hull allows a litre of water to enter the sub before it is repaired.  Assuming constant water density and a hydrostatic distribution, what will be the final equilibrium position of the sub?
