BEGIN_PGML

A thin film of SAE 30 Oil at [`20^{\circ}C`] flows down a vertical wall under the force of gravity. The flow is fully developed.

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, written below, for y-momentum may be applied to this system:

[`\partial v/\partial t +u \partial v/\partial x + v\partial v/\partial y +w \partial v/\partial z = -/\rho\cdot\partial P/\partial y + g_y +\nu (\partial ^2v/\partial x^2 +\partial ^2v/\partial y^2 +\partial ^2v/\partial z^2)`]

Counting the terms from from left to right, making [`\frac{dv}{dt}`] term 1, which terms may be eliminated when simplifying the problem?
