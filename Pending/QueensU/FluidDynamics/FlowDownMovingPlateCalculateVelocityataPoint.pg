$h = random(5,8,1);
$y = random(3,4,0.5);


BEGIN_PGML

SAE 30 oil flows down a long, wide plate that sits at an angle of [`30^{\circ}`] relative to the horizontal. Simultaneously the plate is moving with a speed [`U = [$U]`] [`m/s`] in the negative x direction, as indicated on the diagram. The flow is [`h = [$h]`] [`mm`] thick and is laminar.

[@ image('FlowDownMovingPlateCalculateVelocityataPoint.png', width=>585, height=>323) @]*

Determine the velocity at a distance [`y = [$y]`] [`mm`] from the moving plate. 



Discussion: Is the x directional velocity negative or positive? Comment on what circumstances will make the velocity at that point negative, positive, or zero.

[`u=`][____] [`m/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(4.905/(4.1*10**-4)*($h*$y-$y**2/2)/10**6-$U, reltol => 3, ));
