BEGIN_PGML

A large, cylindrical tank of water has a *sharp edged *orifice through which water is allowed to drain. The orifice has a diameter [`d = 1.0`] [`cm`], and the tank has a diameter of [`D = 0.5`] [`m`]. The tank has a height of [`H = 1.2`] [`m`]. Initially the tank is completely full of water.

If the orifice is replaced with a rounded exit configuration (depicted below), how will the exit velocity be affected?

Discuss: Explain why the velocity changes/stays the same.
