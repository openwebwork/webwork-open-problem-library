BEGIN_PGML

Air travels through a long, straight duct of diameter D with an average velocity of [`20`] [`m/s`]. The flow exits the diffuser with a velocity of [`5`] [`m/s`].

After the exit of the diffuser,

Discuss: For confined flow, what is the relationship between change is diameter and change in average velocity?
