BEGIN_PGML

SAE 30 oil flows down a long, wide plate that sits at an angle of [`30^{\circ}`] relative to the horizontal. Simultaneously the plate is moving with a speed U in the negative x direction, as indicated on the diagram. The flow is [`h = [$h]`] [`mm`] thick and is laminar.

What speed of the plate, [`U`], will ensure that the free surface of the flow has an absolute velocity [`u(h) = 0`]?

[`U=`][____] [`m/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(4.905/(4.1*10**-4)*$h**2/2/10**6, reltol => 3, ));
