BEGIN_PGML

The [`1`] metre wide gate shown below is suspended from a hinge at axis [`A`] and tapers towards the bottom such that [`w = \sqrt{z}`] for [`z < 1`] and [`w = 1`] for [`z > 1`]. 

The gate height [`H = [$H]`] metres and the water depth to the bottom of the gate [`h = [$h]`] metres.

Assume the liquid is water at [`20^{\circ}C`] and the only forces on the gate are pressure, [`F`], and the reaction forces at [`A`].

[@ image('SquareRootGate.png', width=>789, height=>414) @]*

By taking moments about [`A`], find the force [`F`], necessary to begin opening the gate. 

Discussion: Show your integration over the area of the gate to get a final result as a function of the two heights h and H.

Confirm your results by a common-sense estimate to make sure the order of magnitude is right, then by numerical integration over the surface in a spreadsheet, or some other tool (a simple trapezoidal rule approach will work fine).
