BEGIN_PGML

Two fixed horizontal parallel plates are spaced [`[$H]`] [`in`] apart. Water at [`20^{\circ}C`] (properties are given in Table B.2) flows between the plates with a mean velocity of [`[$V]`] [`cm/s`]. The flow is laminar. Determine the absolute value of pressure drop per unit length in the direction of flow.

[`|P| / L =`][____] [`Pa/m`]
