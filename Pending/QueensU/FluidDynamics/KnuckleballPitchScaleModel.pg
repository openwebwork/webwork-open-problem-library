BEGIN_PGML

In baseball a knuckleball is a unique type of pitch where the ball is thrown without inducing any spin (negligible angular velocity). These pitches can cause unpredictable wavering of the ball as it flies through the air due to asymmetric drag forces appearing at its seams. The motions cause the knuckleball to be exceptionally difficult to hit.

[@ image('KnuckleballPitchScaleModel.jpg', width=>321, height=>256) @]*

A knuckleball baseball pitch is thrown through the air (standard conditions) with a velocity of [`V = [$V]`] [`m/s`]. Wind speed is negligible. Approximate the baseball as perfect sphere with a rough surface. A standard baseball has a diameter of approximately [`74`] [`mm`].

In order to better observe the unpredictable flow patterns around a knuckleball pitch, a scaled up model of the baseball, with a diameter of [`[$d]`] [`m`], has been constructed. If the model is to be tested in water ([`\nu`] = [`1.12\cdot 10^{-6}`] [`m^{2}/s`]) what speed, in m/s, should the water be flowing at?



[`V_{H_2O}=`][____] [`m/s`]
