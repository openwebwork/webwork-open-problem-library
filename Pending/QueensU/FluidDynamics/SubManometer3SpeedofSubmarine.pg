BEGIN_PGML

The submersible shown in the diagram is horizontal at a depth of [`15`] metres below the surface in Lake Ontario. A tube is filled with lake water and open to the exterior through a port in the centre of the front of the submersible and open to the exterior through a port in the side of the hull, with a manometer connected in between as shown.

If [`H_1 = [$h1]`] metres, [`H_2 = [$h2]`] metres, and [`h = [$h]`] metres, what is the speed of the sub?

[`V_{sub}=`][____] [`m/s`]
