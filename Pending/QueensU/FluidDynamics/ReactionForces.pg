BEGIN_PGML

The system shown in the figure is supported by a pin (hinge) at [`A`] and by a roller support at [`B`].  The other connections include expansion joints that seal the piping, but don't carry any significant mechanical loads. [`A_1 = A_2 = 0.8`] [`m^2`]. [`A_3 = 1.0`] [`m^2`]. [`V_1 = 20`] [`m/s`] at an angle of [`45^{\circ}`]  to the horizontal, [`V_2 = 10`] [`m/s`]. [`P_1 = 200000`] [`Pa`], [`P_2 = 440000`] [`Pa`] and [`P_3 = 272000`] [`Pa`].

The density of the fluid is [`1000`] [`kg/m^3`].

Determine the reaction at [`B`].

Discussion: Which pressure mode have you chosen to work with in this question, Absolute or Gauge? Explain your choice.
