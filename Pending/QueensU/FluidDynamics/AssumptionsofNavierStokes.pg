BEGIN_PGML

The following is a a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equation for x momentum which we use frequently in this course:

[`\partial u/\partial t +u \partial u/\partial x + v\partial u/\partial y +w \partial u/\partial z = -1/\rho*\partial P/\partial x + g_x +\nu (\partial ^2u/\partial x^2 +\partial ^2u/\partial y^2 +\partial ^2u/\partial z^2)`]

Select all underlying assumptions which must hold for this equation to be true.
