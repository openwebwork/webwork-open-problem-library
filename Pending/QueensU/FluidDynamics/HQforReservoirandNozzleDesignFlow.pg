BEGIN_PGML

A pump provides water supply from a reservoir to a variable area nozzle and the jet from the nozzle must be travelling at [`80`] [`m/s`] to provide adequate reach for fire fighting. Neglect the losses on the suction side of the pump and any minor losses. The dominant losses are from the [`50`] metre length of fire hose which has an inside diameter of [`58`] mm and roughness of [`0.04`] [`mm`]. The nozzle discharge is at approximately the same elevation as the reservoir.

The system is designed for a flow rate of up to [`10`] litres per second, however it may operate at lower flow rates.

What pump head rise in metres is required to drive a flow of [`[$Q]`] litres per second through the piping system?

Discussion: You could construct a head / flow curve like this one based on an equation of the form [`H(Q) = H_o + C \cdot Q^2`], obtaining the values for the constants [`H_o`] and [`C`] from the zero flow and design flow cases. Generate and plot that equation, then plot some individually calculated points on the curve for low, medium and design level flow rates. Comment on your results.
