BEGIN_PGML

Your facility already includes multiple TACO TA 0824 pumps, so using the same pump for a new application has many advantages in terms of spares and maintenance costs. The new application has a design flow of [`0.05`] [`m^3/s`] and a head of [`65`] [`m`] pumping water at [`20^{\circ}C`].

The TA 0824 running at [`3500`] [`RPM`] appears to be in the right range. (Look towards the end of the curve book.)

Which stock impeller size would you choose for this application?

Discussion: Detail the logic behind your choice and provide a copy of the manufacturer's pump curve, showing the operating point you considered to reach your conclusion.

Under what circumstances would you consider a smaller impeller for this application?
