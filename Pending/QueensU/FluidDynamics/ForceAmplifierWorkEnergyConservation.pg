BEGIN_PGML

A hydraulic force amplification device is used to lift a mass of [`m = [$m]`] [`kg`] that sits on a piston with an area of [`A_{2} = [$A2]`] [`m^{2}`]. The mass is supported by applying a force, F, at a piston with an area [`A_{1} = [$A1]`] [`m^2`]. 

[@ image('ForceAmplifierWorkEnergyConservation.png', width=>579, height=>316) @]*

Assuming that frictional losses are negligible, can we say that during piston motion work-energy is conserved in this system? Why?
