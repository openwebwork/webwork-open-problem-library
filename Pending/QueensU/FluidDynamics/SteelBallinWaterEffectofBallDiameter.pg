BEGIN_PGML

A smooth steel ball ([`\rho_{s} = 7850`] [`kg/m^{3}`]) of diameter [`d = 10`] [`mm`] is dropped into a container filled with water ([`\mu`][`_{^{g}}=1.12\cdot 10^{-3}`] [`Ns/m^{2}`]).


[@ image('SteelBallinWaterEffectofBallDiameter1.png', width=>277, height=>323) @]*

The *terminal velocity*, [`V_{t}`], of the steel ball in the water can be determined using the drag coefficient diagram below.

How would the terminal velocity of the steel ball change if the diameter of the ball was increased?
