BEGIN_PGML

A rotational viscometer is a device used to measure the dynamic viscosity of a fluid by submerging a cylinder, disc, or other shape of known geometry into a fluid of interest, and rotating it with a known velocity. The device measures the reaction torque applied to the rotating shape, and uses it to calculate the dynamic viscosity if the fluid. Follow the link below for more detailed information about the rotational principle of viscometers:

http://www.viscopedia.com/methods/measuring-principles/

Consider a simplified 2-dimensional model of a rotational viscometer. A cylinder of height [`h = 5`] [`cm`], and radius [`r = [$r]`] [`cm`] is fully submerged in a fluid of unknown properties. It is rotated with an angular velocity of [`\omega = 5`] [`rad/s`]. The fluid is contained in a cup which has an internal radius of [`R = [$R]`] [`cm`]. The image below depicts a top view of the apparatus.

Ignore the effects of the top and bottom surfaces of the rotating cylinder, and assume a* linear velocity gradient*. If the viscometer reads a reaction torque of [`T = [$T]`] [`Nm`], determine the* dynamic viscosity of the fluid*.
