BEGIN_PGML

A Water manometer is attached to a small pressurized air tank with the geometry depicted below. The heights of the depicted points of the system are: [`h_{1} = [$h1]`] [`m`], [`h_{2} = [$h2]`] [`m`], and [`h_{3} = [$h3]`] [`m`]. 

[@ image('ManometerAttachedtoAirtankReplaceManometerwithMercury.png', width=>332, height=>373) @]*

Suppose the water manometer is replaced with a mercury manometer, but the geometry of the system is maintained. For the same pressure, [`P_{2}`], what is the height difference, [`h_{1}`] - [`h_{2}`]?

[`h_1 - h_2=`][____] [`m`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(($h1-$h2)*1000/13560, reltol => 3, ));
