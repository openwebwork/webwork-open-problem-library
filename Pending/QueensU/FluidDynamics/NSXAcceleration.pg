$mc = RadioButtons(
	["temporal acceleration term in the x momentum equation", "spatial acceleration term in the x momentum equation", "unsteady term in the continuity equation", "viscous stress term in the x momentum equation"],
	"temporal acceleration term in the x momentum equation"

BEGIN_PGML

This term appears in one of the Navier Stokes or continuity equations. Pick the best description of where this term fits: [`\partial u\over \partial t`]  
[@ $mc->buttons() @]*

END_PGML
