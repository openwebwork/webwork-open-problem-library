BEGIN_PGML

Two friends, John and Paul, are designing a yellow submarine for all their friends to live in. During regular operation the center of each window of the submarine will sit [`h = [$h]`] [`m`] below the surface of the water.

[@ image('YellowSubmarineDeterminePressureattheCenteroftheWindow.png', width=>1026, height=>529) @]*

Determine the gauge pressure that will be applied to the center of each window.

[`P=`][____] [`kPa`]
