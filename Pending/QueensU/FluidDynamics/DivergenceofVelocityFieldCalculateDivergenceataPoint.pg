BEGIN_PGML

Consider the cartesian velocity field defined by the following equation:

[`\vec V = 2xy \hat{\imath} + 3y \hat{\jmath} - z \hat{k}`]

At the point [`(x,y,z) = ([$x],[$y],[$z])`], determine the divergence.



Discussion: Is the value of the divergence positive, negative or zero? What does this say about the density of fluid at that point?

[`div=`][____]

ANS(num_cmp(2*$y + 3*$z - 1, reltol => 0, ));
