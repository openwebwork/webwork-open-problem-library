#  Setup

$mc = RadioButtons(
	["All flow through the control volume is laminar", "The volume of the control volume remains constant", "The system is at steady-state", "The linear momentum flow rate into the control volume is constant", "Flow is incompressible"],
	"The system is at steady-state"
);

BEGIN_PGML

The equation below is one of the standard forms of the linear momentum equation:

[`\partial/\partial t \int_{CV} \vec{V}\rho dV\llap{-} + \int_{CS} \vec{V}\rho \vec{V}\cdot \hat{n} dA = \sum F_{CV}`]

where [`V`] is volume, and [`U`] is velocity.

Under what circumstances can the first term of the linear momentum equation be eliminated (made equal to zero) when applied to a control volume?
