BEGIN_PGML

For a certain flow, stream function is given as "[`\psi(x,y) = yx^2`] (x and y are given in meters, but there are (hidden) constants with dimensions that make the velocity have units of [`m/s`] and [`\psi`] of [`m^3/s`]). Determine the magnitude of velocity vector for a particle that passes [`(x,y) = ([$a],[$b])`] [`m`].

[`V=`][____] [`m/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(( ($a**2)**2 + (2*$a*$b)**2 )**(1/2), reltol => 5, ));
