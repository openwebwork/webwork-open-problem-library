BEGIN_PGML

Many small towns supply their citizens with water from a water tower. The height of the tower is used to provide sufficient head for many households and small businesses. For this particular tower a water main pipe of [`20''`] SCH 40, commercial steel piping is used. The entry to the pip in the tower has a well-rounded configuration, and a regular, [`90^{\circ}`] flanged bend is placed at the bottom of the tower. The height of water in the tower is [`h`], and the water must travel through [`300`] [`m`] of water main pipeline before branching into smaller supply pipes. A minimum pressure head of [`25`] [`m`] immediately before branching (at the end of the water main) must be maintained at all times
