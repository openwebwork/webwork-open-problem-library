BEGIN_PGML

Calculate the Reynolds number for a flow of water ([`\rho=1000`] [`kg/m^3`], [`\mu = 0.0011`] [`Pa\cdot s`] ) through a rectangular channel with a height of [`[$H]`] [`m`] and a width of [`[$W]`] [`m`].  The average velocity in the channel is [`[$v]`] [`cm/s`].

[`Re=`][____]

_Hint:Did you remember the Hydraulic Diameter?_

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(1000*($v/100)/0.0011 * (4*$H*$W/(2*($H+$W))), reltol => 1, ));
