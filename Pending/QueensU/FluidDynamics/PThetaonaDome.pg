BEGIN_PGML

The dome shown below is a view window on my submersible. The top of the submersible lies beneath the lake surface at a depth of [`h = [$h]`] and the dome has a radius of [`R = [$R]`]. What is the gauge pressure at an angle [`\theta = [$Th]^{\circ}`] on the dome?

Discussion: Derive a general expression for the pressure as a function of [`\theta`], [`R`], and [`h`].

[`P=`][____] [`kPa`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(998*9.81/1000*($h - $R*sin($Th/180*3.14159)), reltol => 1, ));
