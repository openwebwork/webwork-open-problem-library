$mc = RadioButtons(
	["Incompressible conservation of momentum in the \(z\) direction", "Conservation of angular momentum", "Conservation of mass in the \(z\) direction", "Steady, incompressible conservation of linear momentum in the \(z\) direction"],

[`{\partial v \over \partial t} +u {\partial v \over \partial x}+v{\partial v \over \partial y}+w{\partial v \over \partial z} = -{1 \over \rho}{\partial P \over \partial z}+g_z+\nu ( {\partial^2 v \over \partial x^2}+{\partial^2 v \over \partial y^2}+{\partial^2 v \over \partial z^2})`]

What does this equation represent?
