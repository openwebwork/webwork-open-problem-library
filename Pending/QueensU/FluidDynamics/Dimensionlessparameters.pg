BEGIN_PGML

For a certain fluid flow problem it is known that both the Froude number ([`Fr`]) and the Weber number ([`We`]) are important dimensionless parameters. If the problem is to be studied by using a [`1:15`] model, and for the given condition, Fr and We for the model are [`[$Fr]`] and [`[$We]`], respectively, determine the corresponding value of [`Fr\times We`] for the prototype.

[`Fr\times We=`][____]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp($Fr*$We, reltol => 4, ));
