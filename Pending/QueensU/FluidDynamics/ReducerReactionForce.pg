BEGIN_PGML

A reducer with an exit velocity [`20.04`] [`m/s`] and exit diameter of [`25`] [`mm`] is glued onto the end of a pipe with average velocity [`1.252`] [`m/s`] and a diameter of [`100`] [`mm`]. The density of the fluid is [`1000`] [`kg/m^3`], and the pressure at [`A = [$P]`] [`Pa`]. Making the appropriate assumptions based on the given information, what is the reaction force, [`F_R`]?

Discussion: Which pressure mode have you chosen to work with in this question, Absolute or Gauge? Explain your choice.
