BEGIN_PGML

The depicted system uses a mercury manometer to determine the difference in pressure, [`P_{1}`] - [`P_{2}`]. The following dimensions are provided for the system: [`h_{1} = [$h1]`] m, [`h_{2}= [$h2]`] [`m`], [`h_{3} = [$h3]`] [`m`], and [`h_{4} = [$h4]`] [`m`].

[@ image('MercuryManometerDeterminePressure.png', width=>547, height=>417) @]*

What is the pressure difference, [`P_{1}`] - [`P_{2}`]?

Discussion: How much larger would the manometer have to be to measure using a less environmentally hazardous material such as an oil with a specific gravity of [`0.83`]? Discuss the practical consequences. 

[`P_1 - P_2 =`][____] [`kPa`]
