BEGIN_PGML

A large, cylindrical tank of water has a *sharp edged *orifice through which water is allowed to drain. The orifice has a diameter [`d = 1.0`] [`cm`], and the tank has a diameter of [`D = 0.5`] [`m`]. The tank has a height of [`H = 1.2`] [`m`]. Initially the tank is completely full of water.

Suppose a second hole is drilled in the tank, [`0.25`] [`m`] below the surface of the water. How is the flow rate out of the original orifice affected by this change?

[@ image('DrainingTankResponsetoSecondHole.png', width=>542, height=>380) @]*

Discuss:What would happen if 3 holes were drilled? 4 holes?

Using your understanding of Bernoulli's equation, explain your answer
