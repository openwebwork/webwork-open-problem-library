BEGIN_PGML

A large, cylindrical tank of water has a *sharp edged *orifice through which water is allowed to drain. The orifice has a diameter [`d = [$d]`] [`cm`], and the tank has a diameter of [`D = [$D]`] [`m`]. The tank has a height of [`H = [$H]`] [`m`]. Initially the tank is completely full of water.

At height [`h = [$h]`] [`m`] how fast is the height of water in the tank dropping?

[@ image('DrainingTankRateofChangeofWaterHeightintheTank.png', width=>760, height=>532) @]*

Discuss:

How does your answer compare with the the velocity of the water at the exit?

How would considering the velocity of the water at the surface of the tank affect the calculation of the velocity at the exit?

Is the assumption of negligible velocity at the surface of the water valid?



[`\frac{dh}{dt}=`] [____] [`m/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp(-2 * (sqrt($hm)-sqrt($H))/((0.61*$d/100/$D)**2*sqrt(2*9.81)), reltol => 3, ));
