BEGIN_PGML

A large tank of water is draining through a *sharp edged *orifice as shown. With this sharp edged geometry, the diameter of the water jet will be only about [`78%`] of the diameter of the orifice because of the way the flow has to curve around the corners as shown in the inset. This results in the jet of water having a cross-sectional area of [`61%`] of the area of the orifice, for a Contraction Coefficient of [`0.61`]

The orifice has a diameter [`d = [$d]`] [`cm`] and the height of the water in the tank is [`h = [$H]`] [`m`] at this point in time.

What is the mass flow rate of the water, based on reasonable assumptions, such as fluid properties at [`20^{\circ}C`]?

Discussion: What assumptions are necessary for your solution?

Could you use the same approach to predict how the flow rate is changing with time as the tank empties and h decreases?

How would the flow rate through this orifice change if there were other holes in the tank? Why?

How did you choose the locations for points [`1`] and [`2`]? Could you have used other points? Explain?
