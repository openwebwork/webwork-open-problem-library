BEGIN_PGML

A pump provides water supply from a reservoir to a variable area nozzle and the jet from the nozzle must be travelling at [`80`] [`m/s`] to provide adequate reach for fire fighting. Neglect the losses on the suction side of the pump and any minor losses. The dominant losses are from the [`50`] metre length of fire hose which has an inside diameter of [`58`] [`mm`] and roughness of [`0.04`] [`mm`]. The nozzle discharge is at approximately the same elevation as the reservoir.

The system is designed for a flow rate of up to [`10`] litres per second, however it may operate at lower flow rates.

What pump head rise in metres is required to drive a flow of [`[$Q]`] litres per second through the piping system?
