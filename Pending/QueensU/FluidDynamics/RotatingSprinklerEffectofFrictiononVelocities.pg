BEGIN_PGML

A rotating sprinkler is used to water the grass on a lawn. Water flows into the sprinkler with a velocity of [`V_{1} = [$V1]`] [`m/s`] through a circular inlet of diameter [`D = [$D]`] [`cm`]. Water then flows out through four arms of length [`R = [$R]`] [`m`] and is sprayed at a [`90^{\circ}`] angle through circular holes of diameter [`d = 0.5`] [`cm`]. The sprinkler operates at steady-state, and friction in the system was assumed to be negligible.

[@ image('RotatingSprinklerEffectofFrictiononVelocities.png', width=>585, height=>510) @]*

Suppose that there is unexpected friction in the system such that at steady-state the sprinkler only rotates with an angular velocity of [`\omega`] = 25 rad/s. How does the *actual system's* velocity of water exiting the nozzle relative to the nozzle, [`W_{2}`], and absolute velocity of water exiting the, [`V_{2}`], compare to [`W_{2}`] and  [`V_{2}`] of the expected *system without friction?*

Discussion: How do [`W_{2}`] and  [`V_{2}`] vary with [`\omega`]? How do they vary with volumetric flow rate?
