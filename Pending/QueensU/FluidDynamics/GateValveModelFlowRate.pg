BEGIN_PGML

The prototype of a piping system is depicted below. Water, with a volumetric flow rate of [`Q = [$Q]`] [`m^{3}/s`], flows from a circular cross-sectional pipe of diameter [`D = [$D]`] [`cm`]  into a gate valve.

[@ image('GateValveModelFlowRate.png', width=>338, height=>468) @]*

We would like to build a [`1/10`] scale model of the the system. The scale model will also use water. Calculate the required volumetric flow rate of water through the model system.

[`\dot{V}=`][____] [`m^3/s`]

END_PGML

ANS(num_cmp($Q/10, reltol => 2, ));
