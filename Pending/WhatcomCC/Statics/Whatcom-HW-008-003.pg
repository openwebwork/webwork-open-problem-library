BEGIN_PGML

The cantilever beam is supported by a fixed support at [`A`], and subjected to the force [`F = [$F]`] [`lb`] and the couple [`M = [$M]`] [`ft\cdot lb`]. Determine the equations for [`V(x)`] and [`M(x)`].  Take [`x = 0`] at point [`A`]. Assume [`a = [$a]`] [`ft`] and [`b = [$b]`] [`ft`].

*Support Reactions*

The force reaction at [`A`] is [_____]{"$A"} [`lb`] (take up as positive). 

The couple moment reaction at [`A`] is [_____]{"-$M_A"} [`lb`] (take counterclockwise as positive).

*Shear Force and Bending Moment Equations*

In section [`AB`]:  

[`V(x)=`] [_____]{"$VAB"} [`lb`] and [`M(x)=`] [_____]{"$MAB"} [`ft\cdot lb`]. 

In section [`BC`]: 

[`V(x)=`] [_____]{"$VBC"} [`lb`] and [`M(x)=`] [_____]{"$MBC"} [`ft\cdot lb`].
