BEGIN_PGML

The shelf bracket is subjected to the force [`F`] at an angle [`\theta = [$thetadeg]^{\circ}`].  The maximum reaction force magnitude that either screw attachment can support before failure is [`[$Rmax]`] [`N`].  Determine the maximum force [`F_{max}`] that can be applied to the bracket if the upper attachment is modeled as a pin support and the lower attachment is modeled as a roller.  Also calculate the support reactions at each screw when this maximum force is applied.  Report the support reactions in Cartesian components and assume [`a = [$a]`] [`cm`], [`b = [$b]`] [`cm`], and [`c = [$c]`] [`cm`].

[@ image("Whatcom-HW-004-003.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

The maximum reaction force occurs at [@ $mcCorrect->menu() @]*
