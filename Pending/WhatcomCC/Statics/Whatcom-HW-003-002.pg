BEGIN_PGML

The beam [`ABC`] has a mass of [`[$Mbeam]`] [`kg`] and is supported by the rope [`BDC`] that runs through the frictionless pulley at [`D`]. The winch at [`C`] has a mass of [`[$Mwinch]`] [`kg`]. The tension in the rope acts on the beam at points [`B`] and [`C`] and counteracts the moments due to the beam's weight (acting vertically at the midpoint of its length) and the weight of the winch (acting vertically at point [`C`]) such that the resultant moment about point [`A`] is equal to zero.  Assume that rope segment [`CD`] is vertical and note that rope segment `BD` is not necessarily perpendicular to the beam. Also assume that [`a = [$a]`] [`m`], [`b = [$b]`] [`m`], [`c = [$c]`] [`m`], and [`d = [$d]`] [`m`].

*a)* Compute the tension in the rope.

[`T=`] [_____]{"$T"} [`N`]  

*b)* Model the two forces the rope exerts on the beam as a single equivalent force and couple moment acting at point `B`.  Enter your answer in Cartesian components.

[`\vec{\mathbf{F}}_{eq}=`] [`(`][_____]{"$Feqx"}[`\hat{i}`] [`+`] [_____]{"$Feqy"}[`\hat{j})`] [`N`]  
[`M_{eq}=`] [_____]{"$Meq"}[`\hat{k}`] [`Nm`]  

*c)* Model the two forces the rope exerts on the beam as a single equivalent force (no couple) and determine the distance from `A` to the point along the beam where the equivalent force acts (measured parallel to the beam from `A`). Enter your answer in Cartesian components.

[`\vec{\mathbf{F}}_{eq}=`] [`(`][_____]{"$Feqx"}[`\hat{i}`] [`+`] [_____]{"$Feqy"}[`\hat{j})`] [`N`]
