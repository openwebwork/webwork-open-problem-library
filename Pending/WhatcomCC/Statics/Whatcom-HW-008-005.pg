BEGIN_PGML


The beam is supported by a pin at [`B`] and a roller at [`D`].  The applied loads shown in the figure have magnitudes  [`F_1 = [$F1]`] [`lb`], [`F_2 = [$F2]`] [`lb`], [`w = [$w]`] [`lb/ft`], and [`M = [$M]`] [`ft\cdot lb`]. Determine the equations for [`V(x)`] and [`M(x)`].  Also enter the support reactions as an intermediate check on your work.  Take [`x = 0`] at point [`A`] at the left edge of the beam and assume [`a = [$a]`] [`ft`], [`b = [$b]`] [`ft`], and [`c=[$c]`] [`ft`].
