BEGIN_PGML

A block of mass [`m`] hangs from the end of bar [`AB`] that is [`[$L_beam]`] [`m`] long and connected to the wall in the [`xz`] plane.  The bar is supported at[`A`] by a ball joint such that it carries only a compressive force along its axis.  The bar is supported at end [`B`] by cables [`BD`] and [`BC`] that connect to the [`xz`] plane at points [`C`] and [`D`] respectively with coordinates given in the figure.  Cable [`BD`] is elastic and can be modeled as a linear spring with a spring constant [`k = [$k]`] [`N/m`] and unstretched length of [`[$L0_spring]`] [`m`].

Values for dimensions on the figure are given in the following table. Note the figure may not be to scale.
