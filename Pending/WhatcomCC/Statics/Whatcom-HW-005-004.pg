BEGIN_PGML

Block [`A`] has a mass of [`[$mA]`] [`kg`] and block [`B`] has a mass of [`[$mB]`] [`kg`].  The two blocks are stacked on the ramp with an incline of [`\theta = [$thetadeg] ^{\circ}`].  Determine the largest horizontal force [`F`] that can be applied to block [`B`] without either block moving for each of the following two cases:

[@ image("Whatcom-HW-005-004.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

*a)* The friction coefficient for the contact between blocks [`A`] and [`B`] is [`\mu_{s1} = [$mu1]`] and the friction coefficient for the contact between block [`A`] and the ramp is [`\mu_{s2} = [$mu2]`].

The limiting slip condition occurs at [@ $mcCorrect1->menu() @]*  
[`F_{max}=`] [_____] [`N`]  

*b)* The friction coefficient for the contact between blocks [`A`] and [`B`] is [`\mu_{s1} = [$mu1]`] and the friction coefficient for the contact between block [`A`] and the ramp is [`\mu_{s2} = [$mu3]`].

The limiting slip condition occurs at [@ $mcCorrect2->menu() @]*  
[`F_{max}=`] [_____] [`N`]
