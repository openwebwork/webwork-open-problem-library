Clamps like the one shown are commonly used in woodworking applications. This clamp has the dimensions given in the table below the figure, and its jaws are [`t = [$t]`] [`mm`] thick (in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the picture).   

[@ image("Whatcom-HW-007-001.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

Values for dimensions on the figure are given in the following table.  Note the figure may not be to scale.

*a)* The screws of the clamp are adjusted so that there is a uniform pressure of [`P = [$P]`] [`kPa`] being applied to the workpieces by the jaws. Determine the force carried in each screw.  Hint: the uniform pressure can be modeled in 2-D as a uniform distributed load with intensity [`w = Pt`] (units of [`N/m`]) acting over the length of contact between the jaw and the workpiece.

[`F_{AB}=`] [_____]{"$FAB"} [`N`]  
[`F_{CD}=`] [_____]{"$FCD"} [`N`]  

*b)* Determine the minimum vertical force (parallel to the jaws) required to pull either one of the workpieces out of the clamp jaws.  Use a coefficient of static friction between all contacting surfaces of [`\mu_s = [$mu]`] and the same clamping pressure given for part *a*.

[`F_{min}=`] [_____]{"$Fmin"} [`N`]
