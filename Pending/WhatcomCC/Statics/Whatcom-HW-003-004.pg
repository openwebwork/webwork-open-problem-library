A block hangs from the end of bar [`AB`] that is [`[$L_beam]`] [`m`] long and connected to the wall in the [`xz`] plane. The bar is supported at end [`A`] by a ball joint such that it carries only a compressive force along its axis.  The bar is supported at end [`B`] by cables [`BD`] and [`BC`] that connect to the [`xz`] plane at points [`C`] and [`D`] respectively with coordinates given in the figure.  The tension in cable [`BD`] is measured to be [`[$FBD]`] [`N`].

[@ image("Whatcom-HW-003-004.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

Values for dimensions on the figure are given in the following table. Note the figure may not be to scale.

Determine the equivalent force and couple system acting at [`A`] that models the forces exerted by both cables [`BD`] and [`BC`] on the bar at [`B`].  Enter your results for [`\vec{\mathbf{F}}_{eq}`] and [`\vec{\mathbf{M}}_{eq}`] in Cartesian Components.

[`\vec{\mathbf{F}}_{eq}=`] [`(`][_____]{"$Feqx"}[`\hat{i}`] [`+`] [_____]{"$Feqy"}[`\hat{j}`] [`+`] [_____]{"$Feqz"}[`\hat{k})`] [`N`]
