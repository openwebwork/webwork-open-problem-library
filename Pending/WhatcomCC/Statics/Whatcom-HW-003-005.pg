BEGIN_PGML

Three distributed loads act on a beam as shown.  The load between [`A`] and [`B`] increases linearly from [`0`] to a maximum intensity of [`w_1 = [$W1]`] [`lb/ft`] at point [`B`].  The load then varies linearly with a different slope to an intensity of [`w_2 = [$W2]`] [`lb/ft`] at [`C`].  The load intensity in section [`CD`] of the beam is constant at [`w_3 = [$W3]`] [`lb/ft`].  For each load region, determine the resultant force and the location of its line of action (distance to the right of [`A`] for all cases). Assume [`a = [$a]`] [`ft`], [`b = [$b]`] [`ft`], and [`c = [$c]`] [`ft`].

[@ image("Whatcom-HW-003-005.png", width=>[$width], height=>[$height]) @]*

The resultant load in region [`AB`] is [`F_{R1} =`] [_____]{"$FR1"} [`lb`] and acts [_____]{"$x1"} [`ft`] to the right of [`A`].

The resultant load in region [`BC`] is [`F_{R2} =`] [_____]{"$FR2"} [`lb`] and acts [_____]{"$x2"} [`ft`] to the right of [`A`].

The resultant load in region [`CD`] is [`F_{R3} =`] [_____]{"$FR3"} [`lb`] and acts [_____]{"$x3"} [`ft`] to the right of [`A`].
