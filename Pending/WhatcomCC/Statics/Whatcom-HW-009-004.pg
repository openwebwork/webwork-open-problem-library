A sign [`ABCD`] is constructed from [`[$t]`] [`mm`] thick plate steel (density [`\rho =[$rho]`] [`kg/m^3`]) with the geometry shown in the figure.   The sign is connected to the wall by a pin at [`A`] and also supported by member [`BE`].  Support member [`BE`] is also constructed from [`[$t]`] [`mm`] thick plate steel and is connected by pins at [`B`] and [`E`] respectively.  Determine the reaction forces at [`A`] and [`E`].  Enter your answers in Cartesian components.  The weights of both the sign [`ABCD`] and member [`BE`] should be accounted for in the calculation.  Assume the pins are located a distance [`\frac{w}{2}`] [`cm`] away from the ends at each connection.

Values for dimensions on the figure are given in the following table.  Note the figure may not be to scale.
