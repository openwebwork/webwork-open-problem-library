BEGIN_PGML

A triangular distributed load of max intensity [`w`] acts on beam [`AB`].  The beam is supported by a pin at [`A`] and member [`CD`], which is connected by pins at [`C`] and [`D`] respectively.  Determine the largest load intensity, [`w_{max}`], that can be applied if the pin at `D` can support a maximum force of [`D_{max} = [$Dmax]`] [`N`].  Also determine the reactions at [`A`] and [`C`] and express each answer in Cartesian components. Assume the masses of both beam [`AB`] and member [`CD`] are negligible. Assume [`a = [$a]`] [`m`], [`b = [$b]`] [`m`], and [`c = [$c]`] [`m`].
