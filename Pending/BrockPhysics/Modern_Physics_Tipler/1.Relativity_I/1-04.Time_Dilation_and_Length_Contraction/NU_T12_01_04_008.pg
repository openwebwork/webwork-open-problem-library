BEGIN_TEXT
Two spaceships pass each other traveling in opposite directions. A passenger on ship A, which she knows to be \($length_A\) m long, notes that ship B is moving with a speed of \(0.92\)c relative to A and that the length of B is \(36\) m. What are the lengths of the two spaceships measured by a passenger in B?
