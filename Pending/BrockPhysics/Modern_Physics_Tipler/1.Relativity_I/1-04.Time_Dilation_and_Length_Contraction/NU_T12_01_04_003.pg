BEGIN_TEXT
A \(nova\) is the sudden, brief brightening of a star. Suppose Earth astronomers see two novas occur simultaneously, one in the costellation Orion (The Hunter) and the other in the sonstellation Lyra (The Lyre). Both nova are the same distance from Earth, \(2.5 \times 10^{3}\)c.y, and are in exactly opposite directions from Earth. Observers on board an aircraft flying at \($speed\) km/h on a line from Orion toward Lyra see the same novas buy note that they are not simultaneous.
