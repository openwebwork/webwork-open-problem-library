BEGIN_TEXT
X-rays form ionizing radiation that is dangerous to living tissue and undetectable to the human eye. Suppose that a student researcher working in an X-ray diffraction laboratory is accidentally exposed to a fatal dose of radiation. Calculate the temperature increase of the researcher under the following conditions: the energy of X-ray photons is \($energy\) keV and the researcher absorbs \($photons \times 10^{13}\) photons per each kilogram of body weight during the exposure. Assume that the specific heat of the student's body is \(0.83\) kcal/kg.K.
