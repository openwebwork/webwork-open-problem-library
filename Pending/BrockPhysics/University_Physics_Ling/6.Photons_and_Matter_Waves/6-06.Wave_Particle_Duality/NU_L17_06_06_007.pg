BEGIN_TEXT
Solar wind (radiation) that is incident on the top of Earth's atmosphere has an average intensity of \(1.3\) kW/m<sup>2</sup>. Suppose that you are building a solar sail that is to propel a small toy spaceship with a mass of \($mass\) kg in the space between the International Space Station and the moon. The sail is made from a very light material, which perfectly reflects the incident radiation. To assess whether such a project is feasible, answer the following questions, assuming that radiation photons are incident only in normal direction to the sail reflecting surface.

a) What is the radiation pressure (force per m<sup>2</sup>) of the radiation falling on the mirror-like sail?

b) Given the radiation pressure computed in (a), what will be the acceleration of the spaceship when the sail has of an area of \($area\) m<sup>2</sup>?
