BEGIN_TEXT
If electron is to be diffracted significantly by a crystal, its wavelength must be about equal to the spacing, d, of crystalline planes. Assuming d = \($wavelength\) nm, estimate the potential difference through which an electron must be accelerated from rest if it is to be diffracted by these planes.
