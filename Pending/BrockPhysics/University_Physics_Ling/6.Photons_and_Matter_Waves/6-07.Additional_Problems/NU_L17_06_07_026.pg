BEGIN_TEXT
The spacing between crystalline planes in the NaCl crystal is \(0.281\) nm, as determined by X-ray diffraction with X-rays of wavelength \($wavelength\) nm. What is the energy of neutrons in the neutron beam that produces diffraction peaks at the same locations as the peaks obtained with the X-rays?
