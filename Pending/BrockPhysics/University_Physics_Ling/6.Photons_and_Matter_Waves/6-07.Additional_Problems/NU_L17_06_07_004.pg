BEGIN_TEXT
In about 5 billion years, the sun will evolve to a red giant. Assume that its surface temperature will decrease to about half its present value of \(6000\) K, while its present radius of \(7 \times 10^{8}\) m will increase to \(1.5 \times 10^{11}\) m (which is the current Earth-sun distance). Calculate the ratio of the total power emitted by the sun in its red giant stage to its present power.
