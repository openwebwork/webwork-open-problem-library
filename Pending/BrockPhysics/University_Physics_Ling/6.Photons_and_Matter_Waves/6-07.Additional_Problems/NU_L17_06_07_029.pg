BEGIN_TEXT
In a supercollider at CERN, protons are accelerated to velocities of \(0.25\)c.
$BR
$BR

a) What are their wavelengths at this speed?
$BR
$BR

\{ans_rule(40)\} fm
$BR
$BR

b) What are their kinetic energies?
$BR
$BR

\{ans_rule(40)\} MeV
$BR

c) If a beam of protons were to gain its kinetic energy in only one pass through a potential difference, how high would this potential difference have to be? (Rest mass energy of a proton is \(E_0 = 938\) MeV).
