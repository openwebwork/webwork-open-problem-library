BEGIN_TEXT
Photoelectrons are ejected from a photoelectrode and are detected at a distance of \($distance\) cm away from the photoelectrode. The work function of the photoelectrode is \($work\) eV and the incident radiation has a wavelength of \($wavelength\) nm. How long does it take a photoelectron to travel to the detector?
