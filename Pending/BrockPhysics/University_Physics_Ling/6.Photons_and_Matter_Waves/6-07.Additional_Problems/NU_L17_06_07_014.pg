BEGIN_TEXT
The momentum of light, as it is for particles, is exactly reversed when a photon is reflected straight back from a mirror, assuming negligible recoil of the mirror. The change in momentum is twice the photon's incident momentum, as it is for the particles. Suppose that a beam of light has an intensity \($intensity\) kW/m<sup>2</sup> and falls on a âˆ’ \($area\)-m<sup>2</sup> area of a mirror and reflects from it.
