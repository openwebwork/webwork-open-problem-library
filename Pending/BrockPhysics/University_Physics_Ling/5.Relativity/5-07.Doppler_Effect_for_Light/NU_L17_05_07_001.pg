$frequency_out = random(95,105,1);
$frequency_echo = random(12,18,1);

$E = (2.998*10**8)*((($frequency_out*10**9)-($frequency_out*10**9+$frequency_echo*10**3))/(($frequency_out*10**9)+($frequency_out*10**9+$frequency_echo*10**3)));

BEGIN_TEXT 
A highway patrol officer uses a device that measures the speed of vehicles by bouncing radar off them and measuring the Doppler shift. The outgoing radar has a frequency of \($frequency_out\) GHz and the returning echo has a frequency \($frequency_echo\) kHz higher. What is the velocity of the vehicle? Note that there are two Doppler shifts in echoes. Be certain not to round off until the end of the problem, because the effect is small.
