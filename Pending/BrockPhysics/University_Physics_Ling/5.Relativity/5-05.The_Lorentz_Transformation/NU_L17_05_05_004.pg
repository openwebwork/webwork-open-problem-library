BEGIN_TEXT 
A man standing still at a train station watches two boys throwing a baseball in a moving train. Suppose the train is moving east with a constant speed of \($speed_train\) m/s and one of the boys throws the ball with a speed of \($speed_ball\) m/s with respect to himself toward the other boy, who is \($speed_ball\) m west from him. What is the velocity of the ball as observed by the man on the station?
