BEGIN_TEXT 
A neutral \(\pi\) -meson is a particle that can be created by accelerator beams. If one such particle lives \($t_lab \times 10^{-16}\) s as measured in the laboratory, and \($t_observed \times 10^{-16}\) s when at rest relative to an observer, what is its velocity relative to the laboratory?
