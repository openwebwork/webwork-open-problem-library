Nuclear-powered rockets were researched for some years before safety concerns became paramount.
$BR
$BR

a) What fraction of a rocket's mass would have to be destroyed to get it into a low Earth orbit, neglecting the decrease in gravity? (Assume an orbital altitude of \(250\) km, and calculate both the kinetic energy (classical) and the gravitational potential energy needed.)

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{-10}\)
