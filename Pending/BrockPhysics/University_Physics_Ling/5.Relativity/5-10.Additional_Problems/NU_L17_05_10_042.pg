BEGIN_TEXT
The sun produces energy at a rate of \(3.85 \times 10^{26} \) W by the fusion of hydrogen. About \(0.7\) % of each kilogram of hydrogen goes into the energy generated by the Sun.

a) How many kilograms of hydrogen undergo fusion each second?

\{ans_rule(40)\} kg/s

b) If the sun is \(90.0\) % hydrogen and half of this can undergo fusion before the sun changes character, how long could it produce energy at its current rate?
