BEGIN_TEXT 
Two astronomical events are observed from Earth to occur at a time of \($time\) s apart and a distance separation of \($distance \times 10^{9}\) m from each other. How fast must a spacecraft travel from the site of one event toward the other to make the events occur at the same time when measured in the frame of reference of the spacecraft?
