BEGIN_TEXT 
An observer standing by the railroad tracks sees two bolts of lightning strike the ends of a \($length\)-m-long train simultaneously at the instant the middle of the train passes him at \($speed\) m/s. Use the Lorentz transformation to find the time between the lightning strikes as measured by a passenger seated in the middle of the train.
