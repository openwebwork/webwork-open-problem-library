BEGIN_TEXT
In STM, an elevation of the tip above the surface being scanned can be determined with a great precision, because the tunneling-electron current between surface atoms and the atoms of the tip is extremely sensitive to the variation of the separation gap between them from point to point along the surface. Assuming that the tunneling-electron current is in direct proportion to the tunneling probability and that the tunneling probability is to a good approximation expressed by the exponential function \(e^{-2\beta L}\) with \(\beta = 10.0\)/nm, determine the ratio of the tunneling current when the tip is \(0.500\) nm above the surface to the current when the tip is \(0.515\) nm above the surface.
