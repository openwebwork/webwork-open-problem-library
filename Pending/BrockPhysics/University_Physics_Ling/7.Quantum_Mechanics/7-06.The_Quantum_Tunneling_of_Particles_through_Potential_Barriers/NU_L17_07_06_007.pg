BEGIN_TEXT
A muon, a quantum particle with a mass approximately \(200\) times that of an electron, is incident on a potential barrier of height \(10.0\) eV. The kinetic energy of the impacting muon is \(5.5\) eV and only about \(0.10\) % of the squared amplitude of its incoming wave function filters through the barrier. What is the barrier's width?
