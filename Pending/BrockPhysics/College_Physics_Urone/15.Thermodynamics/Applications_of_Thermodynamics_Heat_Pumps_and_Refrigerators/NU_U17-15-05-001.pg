<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

What is the coefficient of performance of an ideal heat pump that has heat transfer from a cold temperature of \(-$temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to a hot temperature of \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) ?

$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a heat pump is a heat engine running in reverse. Can you first calculate the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between these temperatures? To what scale must you convert the given temperatures?
