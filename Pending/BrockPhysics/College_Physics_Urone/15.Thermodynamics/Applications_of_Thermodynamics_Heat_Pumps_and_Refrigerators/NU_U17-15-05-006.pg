<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the best coefficient of performance for a refrigerator that cools an environment at \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and has heat transfer to another environment at \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the coefficient of performance of a Carnot refrigerator. To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much work in joules must be done for a heat transfer of \($heat\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) from the cold environment? There are \(4186\) \(\textrm{J/kcal}\).
 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given your answer to part (a) above, can you rearrange the formula for the coefficient of performance of a real refrigerator to solve for the work input?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What is the cost of doing this if the work costs \(10.0\) cents per \(3.60 \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{J}\) (a kilowatt-hour)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} cents

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

d) How many \(\textrm{kJ}\) of heat transfer occurs into the warm environment?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the relationship existing between the work and heat transfers for both engines and refrigerators.
