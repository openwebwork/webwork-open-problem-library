<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose you want to operate an ideal refrigerator with a cold temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and you would like it to have a coefficient of performance of \($performance\). What is the hot reservoir temperature for such a refrigerator? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the formula for the coefficient of performance of a Carnot refrigerator to solve for the hot reservoir temperature? To what scale must you first convert the given temperature?
