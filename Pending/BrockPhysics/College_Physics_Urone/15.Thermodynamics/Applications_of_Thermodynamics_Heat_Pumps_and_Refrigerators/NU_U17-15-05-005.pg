<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the best coefficient of performance for a heat pump that has a hot reservoir temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and a cold reservoir temperature of \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a heat pump is a heat engine running in reverse. Can you first calculate the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between these temperatures? To what scale must you convert the given temperatures?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much heat transfer occurs into the warm environment if \($work \times 10^{7}\) J of work is put into it? There are \(4186\) \(\textrm{J/kcal}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given your answer to part (a) above, can you rearrange the formula for the coefficient of performance of a real heat pump to solve for the output heat?
