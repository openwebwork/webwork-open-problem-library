$PAR

An ideal heat pump is being considered for use in heating an environment with a temperature of  \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What is the cold reservoir temperature if the pump is to have a coefficient of performance of \($perf\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the formula for the coefficient of performance of a Carnot heat pump to solve for the sold reservoir temperature? To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
