$PAR

In a very mild winter climate, a heat pump has heat transfer from an environment at \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to one at \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What is the best possible coefficient of performance for these temperatures?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a heat pump is a heat engine running in reverse. Can you first calculate the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between these temperatures? To what scale must you convert the given temperatures?
