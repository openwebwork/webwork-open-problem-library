A large electrical power station generates \($power\) \(\textrm{MW}\) of electricity with an efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\).

Can you rearrange the definition of average power to solve for the change in work? How can you relate this change in work to the heat input?

c) If the heat transfer in the cooling towers is from \($tempwater^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water into the local air mass, which increases in temperature from \($templow^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($temphigh^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), what is the total increase in entropy due to this heat transfer?

Recall the formula giving the change in entropy for a reversible process. At what temperature can this change be considered to occur, given that the change in temperature itself is small? To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
