$PAR

On a hot summer day, \($heat \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer into a parked car takes place, increasing its temperature from \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What is the increase in entropy of the car due to this heat transfer alone?

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J/K}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula giving the change in entropy for a reversible process. At what temperature can this change be considered to occur, given that the change in temperature itself is small? To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
