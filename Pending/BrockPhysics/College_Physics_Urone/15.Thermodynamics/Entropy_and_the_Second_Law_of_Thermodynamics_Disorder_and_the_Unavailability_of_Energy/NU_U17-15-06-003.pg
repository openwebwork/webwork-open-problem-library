A hot rock ejected from a volcano's lava fountain cools quickly from \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and its entropy decreases by \($entropy\) \(\textrm{J/K}\). How much heat transfer occurs from the rock?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula giving the change in entropy for a reversible process. At what temperature can this change be considered to occur, given that the change in temperature itself is small? To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
