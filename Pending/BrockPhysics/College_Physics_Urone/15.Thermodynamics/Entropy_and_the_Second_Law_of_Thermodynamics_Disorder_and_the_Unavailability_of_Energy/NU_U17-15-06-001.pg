$PAR

On a winter day, a certain house loses \($heat \times 10^{8}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat to the outside. What is the total change in entropy due to this heat transfer alone, assuming an average indoor temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and an average outdoor temperature of  \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula giving the change in entropy for reversible process. To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
