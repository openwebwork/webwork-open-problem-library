$PAR

The Sun radiates energy at the rate of \($rate \times 10^{26}\) \(\textrm{W}\) from its \(6000\) \(\textrm{K}\) surface into dark empty space. The effective temperature of deep space is \(-270^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

$PAR

a) What is the increase in entropy in one day due to this heat transfer?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J/K}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula giving the change in entropy for a reversible process and the definition of average power. To what scale must you first convert temperature of deep space?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much work is made unavailable?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for unavailable work. Which temperature should be used in your calculation?
END_HINT
