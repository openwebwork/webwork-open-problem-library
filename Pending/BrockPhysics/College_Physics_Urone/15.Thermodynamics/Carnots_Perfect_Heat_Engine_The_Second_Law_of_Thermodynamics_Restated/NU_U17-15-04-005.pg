Practical steam engines utilize \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) steam, which is later exhausted at \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) .

$PAR

a) What is the maximum efficiency that such a heat engine can have?

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Since \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) steam is still quite hot, a second steam engine is sometimes operated using the exhaust of the first. What is the maximum efficiency of the second engine if its exhaust has a temperature of \($temp3^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

c) What is the overall efficiency of the two engines?

BEGIN_HINT
For all of (a) through (c), recall the formula for the efficiency of a Carnot engine. To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
