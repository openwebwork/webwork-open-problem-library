$PAR

A gas-cooled nuclear reactor operates between hot and cold reservoir temperatures of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and  \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

$PAR

a) What is the maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between these temperatures?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the efficiency of a Carnot engine. To what scale must you first convert the given temperatures?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Find the ratio of this efficiency to the Carnot efficiency of a standard nuclear reactor which is equal to \($eff\) \(\textrm{%}\).
