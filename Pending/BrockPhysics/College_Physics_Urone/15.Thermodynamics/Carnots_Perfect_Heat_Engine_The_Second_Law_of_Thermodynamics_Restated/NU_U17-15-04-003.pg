<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the hot reservoir temperature of a Carnot engine that has an efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\) and a cold reservoir temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the efficiency of a Carnot engine. To what scale must you first convert the given temperature?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What must the hot reservoir temperature be for a real heat engine that achieves \($eff2\)\(\textrm{%}\) of the maximum efficiency, but still has an efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an equation whereby the efficiency of the real heat engine is equal to \($eff2\)\(\textrm{%}\) of the Carnot efficiency?
