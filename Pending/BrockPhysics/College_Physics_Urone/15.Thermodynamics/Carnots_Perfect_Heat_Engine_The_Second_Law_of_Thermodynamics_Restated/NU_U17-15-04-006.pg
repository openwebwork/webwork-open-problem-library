A coal-fired electrical power station has an efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\). The temperature of the steam leaving the boiler is  \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) . What percentage of the maximum efficiency does this station obtain? (Assume the temperature of the environment is  \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).)
