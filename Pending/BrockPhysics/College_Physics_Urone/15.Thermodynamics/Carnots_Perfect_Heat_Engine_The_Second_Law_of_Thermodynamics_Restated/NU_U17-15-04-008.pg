<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> Suppose you want to design a steam engine that has heat transfer to the environment at \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and has a Carnot efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\).

Can you rearrange the formula for the efficiency of a Carnot engine to solve for the hot reservoir temperature? To what scale must you first convert the given temperature?
