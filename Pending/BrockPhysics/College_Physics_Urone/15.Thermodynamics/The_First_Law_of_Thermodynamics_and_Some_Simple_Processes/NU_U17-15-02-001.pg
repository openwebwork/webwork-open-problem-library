$PAR

A car tire contains \($volume\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) of a monatomic gas at a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\). How much more internal energy does this gas have than the same volume has at zero gauge pressure (which is equivalent to normal atmospheric pressure)?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the internal energy of a monoatomic ideal gas. For what parameter(s) must you make a substitution using the ideal gas law?
