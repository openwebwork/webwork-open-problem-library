$PAR

A hand-driven tire pump has a piston with a \($diameter\)-\(\textrm{cm}\) diameter and a maximum stroke of \($stroke\) \(\textrm{cm}\).

$PAR

a) How much work do you do in one stroke if the average gauge pressure is  \($pressure \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for pressure-volume work. How do you calculate the volume of a cylinder?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What average force do you exert on the piston, neglecting friction and gravitational force?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the pressure is defined as the force exerted per unit area.
END_HINT
