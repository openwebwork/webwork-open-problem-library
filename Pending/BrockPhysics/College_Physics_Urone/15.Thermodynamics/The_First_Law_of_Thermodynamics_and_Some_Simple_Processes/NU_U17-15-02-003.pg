$PAR

Steam to drive an old-fashioned steam locomotive is supplied at a constant gauge pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2}\) to a piston with a \($radius\) \(\textrm{m}\) radius.

$PAR

a) Find the work done by the steam when the piston moves \($distance\) \(\textrm{m}\). Note that this is the net work output, since gauge pressure is used.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\) 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for pressure-volume work. How do you calculate the volume of a cylinder?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Now find the amount of work by calculating the force exerted times the distance traveled. Is the answer the same as in part (a)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the pressure is defined as the force exerted per unit area.
