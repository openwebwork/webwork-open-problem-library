<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) A cyclical heat engine, operating between temperatures of \($T1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and \($T2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) produces \($work\) \(\textrm{MJ}\) of work on a heat transfer of \($transfer\) \(\textrm{MJ}\) into the engine. How much heat transfer occurs to the environment?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{MJ}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Calculate the efficiency, expressed as a fraction.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that efficiency is defined as the quotient of the work output and input heat.
