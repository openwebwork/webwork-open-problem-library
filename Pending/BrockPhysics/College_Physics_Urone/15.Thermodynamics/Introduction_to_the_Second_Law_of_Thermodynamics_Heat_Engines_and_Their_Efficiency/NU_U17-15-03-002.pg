<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

With \($heat \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer into this engine, a given cyclical heat engine can do only  \($work \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of work. 

$PAR

a) What is the engine's efficiency, expressed as a percentage?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that efficiency is defined as the quotient of the work output and the input heat.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much heat transfer to the environment takes place?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat.
END_HINT
