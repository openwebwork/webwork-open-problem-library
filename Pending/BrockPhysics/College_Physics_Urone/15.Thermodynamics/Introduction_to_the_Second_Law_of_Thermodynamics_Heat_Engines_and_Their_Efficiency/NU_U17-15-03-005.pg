<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

The engine of a large ship does \($work \times 10^{8}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of work with an efficiency of \($eff\) \(\textrm{%}\).

$PAR

a) How much heat transfer occurs to the environment?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat.  Can you first rearrange the definition of efficiency to make a substitution for the work output?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How many barrels of fuel are consumed, if each barrel produces \($transfer \times 10^{9}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer when burned?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} barrels

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
How much heat is supplied to the engine?
