$PAR

A certain heat engine does \($work\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of work and \($transfer\) \(\textrm{KJ}\) of heat transfer occurs to the environment in a cyclical process. 

$PAR

a) What was the heat transfer into this engine?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What was the engine's efficiency, expressed as a percentage?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that efficiency is defined as the quotient of the work output and input heat.
END_HINT
