$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Assume that the turbines at a coal-powered power plant were upgraded, resulting in an improvement in efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\). Assume that prior to the upgrade the power station had an efficiency of \($eff2\)\(\textrm{%}\) and that the heat transfer into the engine in one day is still the same at \($heat \times 10^{14}\) \(\textrm{J}\).

$PAR

a) How much more electrical energy is produced due to the upgrade?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work output before and after the upgrade?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What difference in heat transfer occurs to the environment due to the upgrade?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat.  Can you use your results from part (a) above to the determine the heat lost to the environment before and after the upgrade?
