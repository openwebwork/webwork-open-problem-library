<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the efficiency of a cyclical heat engine in which \($heat\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of heat transfer occurs to the environment for every \($transfer\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of heat transfer into the engine?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that efficiency is defined as the quotient of the work output and input heat. Given that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat, can you first make a substitution for the work output?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much work does it produce for \($transfer2\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of heat transfer into the engine?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work output?
