$PAR

This problem compares the energy output and heat transfer to the environment by two different types of nuclear power stationsâ€”one with the normal efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\), and another with an improved efficiency of \($eff2\)\(\textrm{%}\). Suppose both have the same heat transfer into the engine in one day, \($heat \times 10^{14}\) \(\textrm{J}\).

$PAR

a) How much more electrical energy is produced by the more efficient power station?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work outputs of the power plants?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much less heat transfer occurs to the environment by the more efficient power station? (One type of more efficient nuclear power station, the gas-cooled reactor, has not been reliable enough to be economically feasible in spite of its greater efficiency.)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat. Can you use your results from part (a) above to the determine the how much heat each power plant loses to the environment?
