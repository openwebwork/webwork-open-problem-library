<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) How much heat transfer occurs to the environment by an electrical power station that uses \($heat \times 10^{14}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer into the engine with an efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\)?
  
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat.  Can you first rearrange the definition of efficiency to make a substitution for the work output?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

$PAR

b) What is the ratio of heat transfer to the environment to work output?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you now rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work output?
END_HINT

c) How much work is done?
