$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the work output of a cyclical heat engine having a \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\) efficiency and \($heat \times 10^{9}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer into the engine?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work output?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much heat transfer occurs to the environment?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that, for a heat engine, the input heat is equal to the sum of the work output and wasted heat. Can you solve, then, for the heat lost to the environment, given your answer from part (a)?
