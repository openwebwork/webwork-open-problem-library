<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

How much heat transfer occurs from a system, if its internal energy decreased by \($decrease\) \(\textrm{J}\) while it was doing \($work\) \(\textrm{J}\) of work?

$PAR

\(-\) \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first law of thermodynamics. Is work positive if it is done by the system or on the system?
