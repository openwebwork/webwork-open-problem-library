<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the average metabolic rate in watts of a man who metabolizes \($energy\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of food energy in one day?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that average power is defined as the quotient of the changes in energy and time.
END_HINT

$PAR

b) What is the maximum amount of work in joules he can do without breaking down fat, assuming a maximum efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work output?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) Compare his work output with the daily output of a \(187\)-\(\textrm{W}\) motor.

$PAR

The motor produces \{ans_rule(10)\} times the work done by the man.
