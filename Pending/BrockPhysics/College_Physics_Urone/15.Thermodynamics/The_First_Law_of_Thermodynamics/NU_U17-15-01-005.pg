<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose a woman does \($work\) \(\textrm{J}\) of work and \($heat\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer occurs into the environment in the process.

$PAR

a) What is the decrease in her internal energy, assuming no change in temperature or consumption of food? (That is, there is no other energy transfer.) 

$PAR

\(-\) \{ans_rule(30)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first law of thermodynamics. Is work positive when it is done on the system or by the system? What about the heat transfer; is it positive when heat flows into or out of the system?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is her efficiency, expressed as a fraction?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that efficiency is defined as the quotient of work output and the change in internal energy.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));
