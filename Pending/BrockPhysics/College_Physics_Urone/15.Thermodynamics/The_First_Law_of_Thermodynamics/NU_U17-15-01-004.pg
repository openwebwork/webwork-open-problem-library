<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

What is the change in internal energy of a system which does \($workdone \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{J}\)  of work while \($heatin \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer occurs into the system, and \($heatout \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer occurs to the environment?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first law of thermodynamics. Is work positive when it is done on the system or by the system? What about the heat transfer; is it positive when heat flows into or out of the system?
