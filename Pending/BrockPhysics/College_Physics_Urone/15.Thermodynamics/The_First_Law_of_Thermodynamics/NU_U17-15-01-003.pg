<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A system does \($work \times 10^{8}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of work while \($heat \times 10^{8}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of heat transfer occurs to the environment. What is the change in internal energy of the system assuming no other changes (such as in temperature or by the addition of fuel)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first law of thermodynamics. Is work positive when it is done on the system or by the system? What about the heat transfer; is it positive when heat flows into or out of the system?
