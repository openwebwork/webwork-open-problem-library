<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) How much food energy will a man metabolize in the process of doing \($work\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of work with an efficiency of \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\)? \(1\) \(\textrm{kcal}\) contains \(4.186\) \(\textrm{kJ}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the change in internal energy?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much heat transfer occurs to the environment to keep his temperature constant?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first law of thermodynamics. Does the man's metabolizing food represent an increase or decrease in internal energy?
END_HINT
