<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A woman climbing the Washington Monument metabolizes \($energy\) \(\textrm{kJ}\)  of food energy. If her efficiency is \($eff\)\(\textrm{%}\), how much heat transfer occurs to the environment to keep her temperature constant?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the definition of efficiency to solve for the work output? How could you then substitute this result into the first law of thermodynamics?
