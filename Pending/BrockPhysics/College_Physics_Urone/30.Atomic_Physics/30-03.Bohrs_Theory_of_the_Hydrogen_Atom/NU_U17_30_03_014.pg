$PAR
A beryllium ion with a single electron (denoted \(\textrm{Be}\)<sup>3+</sup> ) is an excited state with radius the same as that of the ground state of hydrogen.
$PAR

a) What is \(\textrm{n}\) for the \(\textrm{Be}\)<sup>3+</sup> ion?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR

b) How much energy in \(\textrm{eV}\) is needed to ionize the ion from this excited state?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{eV}\)
$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that \(\textrm{n}\) and \(\textrm{Z}\) are positive, whole numbers.
