$PAR
Atoms can be ionized by thermal collisions, such as at the high temperatures found in the solar corona. One such ion is \(\textrm{C}\)<sup>+5</sup>, a carbon atom with only a single electron.
$PAR

a) By what factor are the energies of its hydrogen-like levels greater than those of hydrogen?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR

b) What is the wavelength of the first line in this ion's Paschen series?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{nm}\)
$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the \(\textrm{Z}\) value for \(\textrm{C}\)<sup>+5<sup>.
