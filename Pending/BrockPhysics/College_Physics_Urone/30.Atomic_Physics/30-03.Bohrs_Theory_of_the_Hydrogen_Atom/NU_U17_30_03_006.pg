$energy = random(0.544,0.850,0.306);

$E = (13.6/$energy)**(1/2);

BEGIN_TEXT 
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A hydrogen atom in an excited state can be ionized with less energy than when it is in its ground state. What is n for a hydrogen atom if \($energy \, \(\textrm{eV}\) of energy can ionize it?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{eV}\)

BEGIN_HINT
You must rearrange the appropriate formula to find \(\textrm{n}\)
