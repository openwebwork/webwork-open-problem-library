$PAR
In Millikan's oil-drop experiment, one looks at a small oil drop held motionless between two plates. Take the voltage between the plates to be \($voltage \, \(\textrm{V}\), and the plate separation to be \($separation \, \(\textrm{cm}\). The oil drop (of density \($density\, \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\)) has a diameter of \($diameter\) \(\times 10^{-6} \, \(\textrm{m}\). Find the charge on the drop, in terms of electron units.
