<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A carbon dioxide laser used in surgery emits infrared radiation with a wavelength of \($wavelength\) \(\mu\(\textrm{m}\). In \($time \, \(\textrm{ms}\), this laser raised the temperature of \($area\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\) of flesh to \(100^{\circ}\)\(\textrm{C}\) and evaporated it (assume body temperature is \(37^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\)).
$PAR

a) How many photons were required? You may assume flesh has the same heat of vaporization as water.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} photons
$PAR

b) What was the minimum power output during the flash?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{MW}\)
$PAR
