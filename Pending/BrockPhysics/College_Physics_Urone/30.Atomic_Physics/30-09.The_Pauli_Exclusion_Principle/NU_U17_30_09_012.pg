$PAR
In a Millikan oil-drop experiment, a \($voltage \, \(\textrm{V}\) potential difference is applied to plates separated by \($distance \, \(\textrm{cm}\).
$PAR

a) What is the mass of an oil drop having two extra electrons that is suspended motionless by the field between the plates?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{-16} \, \(\textrm{kg}\)
$PAR

b) What is the diameter of the drop, assuming it is a sphere with the density of olive oil?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
