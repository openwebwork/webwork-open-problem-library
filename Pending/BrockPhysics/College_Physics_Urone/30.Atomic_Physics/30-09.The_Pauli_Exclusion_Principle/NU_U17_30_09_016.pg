$PAR
Particles called muons exist in cosmic rays and can be created in particle accelerators. Muons are very similar to electrons, having the same charge and spin, but they have a mass \(207\) times greater. When muons are captured by anatom, they orbit just like an electron but with a smaller radius, since the mass in \(a_B=\frac{h^{2}}{4\pi^{2}m_ekq_e^2}=0.529\times 10^{-10}\) \(\textrm{m}\) is \(207 m_e\).
$PAR

Calculate the radius of the \(n = 1\) orbit for a muon in a uranium ion \((Z = 92)\).
