$PAR
A neighboring galaxy rotates on its axis so that stars on one side move toward us as fast as \($speed \, \(\textrm{km/s}\), while those on the other side move away as fast as \($speed \, \(\textrm{km/s}\). This causes the EM radiation we receive to be Doppler shifted by velocities over the entire range of \(\pm $speed \, \(\textrm{km/s}\). What range of wavelengths will we observe for the \(656.0 \, \(\textrm{nm}\) line in the Balmer series of hydrogen emitted by stars in this galaxy. (This is called line broadening.)
$PAR

The range is from \{ans_rule(10)\}\(\textrm{nm}\) (toward) to \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\textrm{nm}\) (away)
