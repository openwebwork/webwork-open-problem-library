$PAR
A pulsar is a rapidly spinning remnant of a supernova. It rotates on its axis, sweeping hydrogen along with it so that hydrogen on one side moves toward us as fast as \($speed \, \(\textrm{km/s}\), while that on the other side moves away as fast as \($speed \, \(\textrm{km/s}\). This means that the EM radiation we receive will be Doppler shifted over a range of \(\pm $speed \, \(\textrm{km/s}\) . What range of wavelengths will we observe for the \(91.20 \, \(\textrm{nm}\) line in the Lyman series of hydrogen? (Such line broadening is observed and actually provides part of the evidence for rapid rotation.)
$PAR

The range is from \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\textrm{nm}\) (toward) to \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\textrm{nm}\) (away)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formulas for Doppler shifts.
