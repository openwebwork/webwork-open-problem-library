Most automobiles have a coolant reservoir to catch radiator fluid that may overflow when the engine is hot. A radiator is made of copper and is filled to its \($Vi\)-\(\textrm{L}\) capacity when at \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What volume of radiator fluid will overflow when the radiator and fluid reach their \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) operating temperature, given that the fluid's volume coefficient of expansion is \($beta1fluid \times 10^{-6}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for volumetric thermal expansion. By how many more litres does the coolant expand relative to the radiator? You will need to research the coefficient of volume expansion for copper.
