A physicist makes a cup of instant coffee and notices that, as the coffee cools, its level drops \(3.00\) \(\textrm{m}\) in the glass cup. Show that this decrease cannot be due to thermal contraction by calculating the decrease in level if the \($volumecm\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\) of coffee is in a \(7.00\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-diameter cup and decreases in temperature from \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). (Most of the drop in level is actually due to escaping bubbles of air). The thermal expansion of water is \(210 \times 10^{-6}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\) and glass is \(27 \times 10^{-6}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for volumetric expansion. By how many more units of volume does the coffee contract relative to the glass? Take the mug to be a cylinder having the given dimensions.
