The height of the Washington Monument is measured to be \(170\) \(\textrm{m}\) on a day when the temperature is \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What will its height be on a day when the temperature falls to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? Although the monument is made of limestone, assume that its thermal coefficient of expansion is the same as marble's. The thermal coefficient of expansion of marble is \(7 \times 10^{-6}\) \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for linear thermal expansion. Pay attention to the wording of the question - you are being asked to find the monument's <i>new</i> height, not simply its change in height.
