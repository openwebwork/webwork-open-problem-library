How much taller does the Eiffel Tower become at the end of a day when the temperature has increased by \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? Its original height is \(321\) \(\textrm{m}\) and you can assume it is made of steel. The thermal coefficient of steel is \(1.2 \times 10^{-5}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\).
