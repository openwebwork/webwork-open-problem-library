$PAR

The density of water at \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is very nearly \($densitywater\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\), whereas the density of ice at \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is \($densityice\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\). Calculate the pressure necessary to keep ice from expanding when it freezes, neglecting the effect such a large pressure would have on the freezing temperature. (This problem gives you only an indication of how large the forces associated with freezing water might be).

BEGIN_HINT
Assume you begin with one cubic metre of water. What new volume does this water occupy when it is fully frozen? What is its change in volume? Can you then solve for pressure, recalling the formula for volumetric thermal stress? You will have to research the bulk modulus of water.
