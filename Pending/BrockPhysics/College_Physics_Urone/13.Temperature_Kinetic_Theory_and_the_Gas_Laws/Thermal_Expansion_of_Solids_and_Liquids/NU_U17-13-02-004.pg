How large an expansion gap should be left between steel railroad rails if they may reach a maximum temperature \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) greater than when they were laid? Their original length is \($length\) \(\textrm{m}\). The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is equal to \(1.2 \times 10^{-5}\) \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\).
