$PAR

a) If a \($volume\)-\(\textrm{mL}\) glass beaker is filled to the brim with ethyl alcohol at a temperature of \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) how much will overflow when its temperature reaches \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? The coefficient of volume expansion for ethyl alcohol is \($betaethanol \times 10^{-3}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\). Assume the beaker is initially in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and does not undergo any temperature change as the ethyl alcohol is transferred.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{mL}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for volumetric thermal expansion.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$deltaVa"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much less water would overflow under the same conditions? The coefficient of volume expansion for ethyl alcohol is \($betawater \times 10^{-4}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{mL}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for volumetric thermal expansion, but be careful - you are being asked to determine how much <i>less</i> water would have overflown.
