<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> If you want to cook in water at \(150 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), you need a pressure cooker that can withstand the necessary pressure.

a) What pressure is required for the boiling point of water to be this high? 

$BR
$BR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
You will need to research tabulated values of the boiling point of water as a function of atmospheric pressure.

b) If the lid of the pressure cooker is a disk \($diameter\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter, what force must it be able to withstand at this pressure?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that pressure is defined as the force per unit area. What pressures (and thus forces) act on each side of the lid?
