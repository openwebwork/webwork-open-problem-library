<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> To get an idea of the small effect that temperature has on Archimedes' principle, calculate the fraction of a copper block's weight that is supported by the buoyant force in \(0^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water and compare this fraction with the fraction supported in \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). The coefficient of volume expansion for copper is equal to \(5.1 \times 10^{-5}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\) and the coefficient of volume expansion for water is equal to \(2.10 \times 10^{-4}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\). The density of copper is \(8800\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\). The weight of the copper block can be treated as \(1.00\) \(\textrm{N}\) for simplicity.

a) Buoyant Force at \(0^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) = \{ans_rule(20)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the upward-acting buoyant force on a object submerged in fluid is equal in magnitude to the weight to the fluid displaced.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that density is defined as the mass per unit volume. How do the volumes of the water and copper block change with temperature?
