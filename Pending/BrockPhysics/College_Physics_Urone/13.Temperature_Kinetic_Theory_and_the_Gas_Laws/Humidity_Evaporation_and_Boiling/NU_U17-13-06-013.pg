Late on an autumn day, the relative humidity is \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) and the temperature is \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What will the relative humidity be that evening when the temperature has dropped to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), assuming constant water vapor density? The saturated vapor density at \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is equal to \(17.2\) \(\textrm{g/m}^3\) and the saturated vapor density at \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is equal to \(9.40\) \(\textrm{g/m}^3\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that percent relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the vapour density to the saturation vapour density, holding temperature constant. Can you first solve for the vapour density at \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?
