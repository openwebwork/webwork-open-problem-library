$PAR

Air in human lungs has a temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and a saturation vapor density of \(44.0\) \(\textrm{g/m}^3\).

$PAR

a) If \($volume\) \(\textrm{L}\) of air is exhaled and very dry air inhaled, what is the maximum loss of water vapor by the person?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What must be (a), the vapour density of the <i>very dry</i> air inhaled, and (b), the vapour density of the exhaled air, for the loss of water to be maximized?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Calculate the partial pressure of water vapor having a density equal to the saturation vapour density at this temperature.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for pressure? For what parameter must you make a substitution? You will have to research the molar mass of water.
