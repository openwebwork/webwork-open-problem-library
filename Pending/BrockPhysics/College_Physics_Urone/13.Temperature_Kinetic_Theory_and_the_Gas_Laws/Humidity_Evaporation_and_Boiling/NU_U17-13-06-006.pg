$PAR

At a spot in the high Andes, water boils at \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), greatly reducing the cooking speed of potatoes, for example. What is atmospheric pressure at this location?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
You will have to research tabulated values of the boiling point of water as a function of atmospheric pressure.
