<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> An automobile mechanic claims that an aluminum rod fits loosely into its hole on an aluminum engine block because the engine is hot and the rod is cold. If the hole is \(10.0\)\(\textrm{%}\) bigger in diameter than the \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) rod, at what temperature will the rod be the same size as the hole? The coefficient of linear expansion of aluminum is equal to \(2.5 \times 10^{-5}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}^{-1}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for linear thermal expansion in two dimensions. Can you solve for the temperature at which the cross-sectional areas of the rod and hole are equal?
