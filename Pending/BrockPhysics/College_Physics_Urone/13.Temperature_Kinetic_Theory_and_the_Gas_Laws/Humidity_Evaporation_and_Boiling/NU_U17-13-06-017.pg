<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> The boiling point of water increases with depth because pressure increases with depth. At what depth will fresh water have a boiling point of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) , if the surface of the water is at sea level? The vapor pressure at \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is \(4.76 \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) and use \(1.01 \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) as the normal atmospheric pressure.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula giving the gauge pressure of a fluid as a function of its density and a specified depth. Are the given pressures gauge or absolute measurements?
