$PAR

A deep-sea diver should breathe a gas mixture that has the same oxygen partial pressure as at sea level, where dry air contains \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) oxygen and has a total pressure of \(1.013 \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\).

$PAR

a) What is the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What amount of the total pressure does that exerted by oxygen constitute?
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) If the diver breathes a gas mixture at a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\), what percent oxygen should it be to have the same oxygen partial pressure as at sea level?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you use your answer from (a) and the given gas mixture pressure to determine the new percent of pressure exerted by oxygen?
