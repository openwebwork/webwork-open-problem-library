$PAR

Pressure cookers increase cooking speed by raising the boiling temperature of water above its value at atmospheric pressure.

$PAR

a) What pressure is necessary to raise the boiling point to \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that water boils when its vapour pressure equals the pressure of its surroundings. 
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What gauge pressure does this correspond to?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that gauge pressure is defined as the difference of the absolute and atmospheric pressures.
