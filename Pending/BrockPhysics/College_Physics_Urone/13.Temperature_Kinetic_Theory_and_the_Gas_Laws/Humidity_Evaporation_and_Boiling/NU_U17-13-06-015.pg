$PAR

What is the dew point on a day when relative humidity is \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) at a temperature of \(20^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? The saturation vapor density at \(20^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is equal to \($svd\) \(\textrm{g/m}^3\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the dew point is the temperature at which the air reaches \(100\)\(\textrm{%}\) relative humidity. What would be the saturation vapour density at the dew point for air at \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) relative humidity? Can you then devise a linear equation that interpolates the temperature at which the air reaches the dew point? You will need to research tabulated values of the saturation vapour density as a function of temperature.
