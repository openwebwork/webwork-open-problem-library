$PAR

The escape velocity from the Moon is much smaller than from Earth and is only \($vkm\) \(\textrm{km/s}\). At what temperature would hydrogen molecules having a molecular mass is equal to \($Mg \times 10^{-3}\) \(\textrm{kg/mol}\) have an average velocity equal to the Moon's escape velocity?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you arrange the formula for the root-mean-square speed of a gas molecule to solve for temperature?
