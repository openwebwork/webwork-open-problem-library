There are two important isotopes of uranium â€”  <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U; these isotopes are nearly identical chemically but have different atomic masses. Only <sup>235</sup>U is very useful in nuclear reactors. One of the techniques for separating them (gas diffusion) is based on the different average velocities (v<sub>rms</sub>) of uranium hexafluoride gas, UF<sub>6</sub>.

$PAR

a) The molecular masses for  <sup>235</sup>U UF<sub>6</sub>  and <sup>238</sup>U UF<sub>6</sub> are \($M235\) \(\textrm{kg/mol}\) and \($M238\) \(\textrm{kg/mol}\), respectively. What is the ratio of their average velocities?

Recall the formula for the root-mean-square speed of a gas molecule. To what exponent is the molar mass parameter raised?
