$PAR

Much of the gas near the Sun is atomic hydrogen. Its temperature would have to be  \($temp \times 10^{7}\) \(\textrm{K}\) for the average velocity to equal the escape velocity from the Sun. What is that velocity?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the root-mean-square speed of a gas molecule. You will have to research the molar mass of monoatomic hydrogen.
