$PAR


Large helium-filled balloons are used to lift scientific equipment to high altitudes.

$PAR

a) What is the pressure inside such a balloon if it starts out at sea level with a temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and rises to an altitude where its volume is twenty times the original volume and its temperature is \(-$temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{atm}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the ideal gas law. What parameters are constant as the helium in the balloon moves from its initial to final state? What parameters must be converted to an absolute scale? Pay attention to the units requested.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the gauge pressure? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{atm}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that gauge pressure is defined as the difference between the absolute and atmospheric pressures.
