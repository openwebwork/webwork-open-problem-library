a) In the deep space between galaxies, the density of atoms is as low as \(10^{6}\) \(\textrm{atoms/m}^3\) and the temperature is a frigid \($temp\) \(\textrm{K}\). What is the pressure?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the ideal gas law to make solve for pressure? For what parameter must you make a substitution?
END_HINT

b) What volume is occupied by \(1\) \(\textrm{mol}\) of gas?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^3\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you use your answer from part (a) above in conjunction with the ideal gas law to solve for volume?
END_HINT

$PAR

c) If this volume is a cube, what is the length of its sides?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the volume of a cube.
