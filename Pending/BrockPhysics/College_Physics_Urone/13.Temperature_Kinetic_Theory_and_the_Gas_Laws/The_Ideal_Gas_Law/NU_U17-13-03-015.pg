Calculate the depth to which Avogadro's number of table tennis balls would cover Earth. Each ball has a diameter of \(3.75\) \(\textrm{cm}\). Assume the space between balls adds an extra \(25.0\)\(\textrm{%}\) to their volume and assume they are not crushed by their own weight. Take the radius of the Earth to be \(6.376 \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{m}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere. What volume is occupied by Earth and balls together? By the Earth alone? Can you then devise a formula giving the difference in radii between these nested spheres?
