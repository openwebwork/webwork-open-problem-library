$PAR

A high-pressure gas cylinder contains \($volume\) \(\textrm{L}\) of toxic gas at a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{7}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) and a temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). Its valve leaks after the cylinder is dropped. The cylinder is cooled to dry ice temperature, \(-78.5^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), to reduce the leak rate and pressure so that it can be safely repaired.

$PAR

a) What is the final pressure in the tank, assuming a negligible amount of gas leaks while being cooled and that there is no phase change?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

b) What is the final pressure if one-tenth of the gas escapes?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) To what temperature must the tank be cooled to reduce the pressure to \(1.00\) atm (assuming the gas does not change phase and that there is no leakage during cooling)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{K}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For all of parts (a) through (c), recall the ideal gas law. What parameters remain constant as the nitrogen in the tank moves from its initial to final state? What parameters must be converted to an absolute scale?
