$PAR

Suppose a gas-filled incandescent light bulb is manufactured so that the gas inside the bulb is at atmospheric pressure when the bulb has a temperature of \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

$PAR

a) Find the gauge pressure inside such a bulb when it is hot, assuming its average temperature is \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) (an approximation) and neglecting any change in volume due to thermal expansion or gas leaks.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{atm}\) 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the ideal gas law. What parameters are constant as the gas in the light bulb moves from its initial to final state? What parameters must be converted to an absolute scale? Pay attention to the units requested.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) The actual final pressure for the light bulb will be less than calculated in part (a) because the glass bulb will expand. What will the actual final pressure be, taking this into account?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{atm}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the ideal gas law. Now what parameters are constant? Can you devise an expression for the final volume, recalling the formula for volumetric thermal expansion? You will have to research the coefficient of volume expansion for glass.
