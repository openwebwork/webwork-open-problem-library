$PAR

An airplane passenger has \($volume\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\) of air in his stomach just before the plane takes off from a sea-level airport. What volume will the air have at cruising altitude if cabin pressure drops to \($pressure \times 10^{4}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the ideal gas law. What parameters are constant as the air in the passenger's lungs moves from its initial to final state? What parameters must be converted to an absolute scale?
