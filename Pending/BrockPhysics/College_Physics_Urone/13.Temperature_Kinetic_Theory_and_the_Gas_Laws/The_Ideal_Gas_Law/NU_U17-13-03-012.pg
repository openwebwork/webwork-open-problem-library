$PAR
A bicycle tire has a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) at a temperature of  \($temp^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and contains \($volume\) \(\textrm{L}\) of gas. What will its pressure be if you let out an amount of air that has a volume of \(100\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\) at atmospheric pressure? Assume tire temperature and volume remain constant.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the ideal gas law. What parameters are constant as the air in the tire moves from its initial to final state? What parameter changes as the air is expelled?
