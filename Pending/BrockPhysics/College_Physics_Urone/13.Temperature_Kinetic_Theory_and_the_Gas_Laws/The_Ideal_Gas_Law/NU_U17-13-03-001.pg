$PAR

The gauge pressure in your car tires is \($pressureg1 \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) at a temperature of \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)  when you drive it onto a ferry boat to Alaska. What is their gauge pressure later, when their temperature has dropped to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) ?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the ideal gas law. What parameters are constant as the air in the tire moves from its initial to final state? What parameters must be converted to an absolute scale?
