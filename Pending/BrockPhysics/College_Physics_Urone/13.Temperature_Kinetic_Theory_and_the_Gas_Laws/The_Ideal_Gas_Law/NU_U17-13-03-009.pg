$PAR

Use \(6.02 \times 10^{23}\) as Avogadro's number.

$PAR

a) What is the volume of Avogadro's number of sand grains if each grain is a cube and has sides that are \($Lc\) \(\textrm{mm}\) long? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^3\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Vtotal"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How many kilometers of beaches in length would this cover if the beach averages \($Lb\) \(\textrm{m}\) in width and \($Db\) \(\textrm{m}\) in depth? Neglect air spaces between grains.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What is the area of the beach in the given plane? Then, using this result and your answer to part (a) above, can your calculate the length of beaches covered? Dimensional analysis might be of help to you here.
