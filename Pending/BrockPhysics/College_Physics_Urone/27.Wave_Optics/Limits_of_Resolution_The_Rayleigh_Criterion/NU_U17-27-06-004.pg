<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$BR
a) What is the minimum angular spread of a \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) wavelength He-Ne laser beam that is originally \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{mm}\) in diameter?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{rad}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If this laser is aimed at a mountain cliff \($d \, \(\textrm{km}\) away, how big will the illuminated spot be? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) How big a spot would be illuminated on the Moon, neglecting atmospheric effects? The distance to the moon is \(382\) million meters.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Part (b) and (c) refer to diameter rather than area.
