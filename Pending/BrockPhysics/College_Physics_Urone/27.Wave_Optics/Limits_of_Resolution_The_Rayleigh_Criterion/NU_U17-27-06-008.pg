BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
You are told not to shoot until you see the whites of their eyes. If the eyes are separated by \($d2 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) and the diameter of your pupil is \($d \, \(\textrm{mm}\), at what distance can you resolve the two eyes using light of wavelength \(555 \, \(\textrm{nm}\)?

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
First, find the angle which you can use to create a triangle to solve the problem.
