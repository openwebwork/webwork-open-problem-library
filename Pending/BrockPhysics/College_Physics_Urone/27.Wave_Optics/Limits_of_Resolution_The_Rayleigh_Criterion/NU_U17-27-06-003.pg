$PAR
Diffraction spreading for a flashlight is insignificant compared with other limitations in its optics, such as spherical aberrations in its mirror. To show this, calculate the minimum angular spreading of a flashlight beam that is originally \($d \, \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter with an average wavelength of \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\).

BEGIN_HINT
How are angle \(\theta\) and wavelength \(\lambda\) related in this question?
