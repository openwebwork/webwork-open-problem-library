$wave = random(380,760,0.1);

$A1 = (4.50*(10**(9)))*((1.22)*($wave*(10**(-9)))/(5.08));

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
The planet Pluto and its Moon Charon are separated by \(19,600 \, \(\textrm{km}\). Neglecting atmospheric effects, at what distance will the \(5.08 \, \(\textrm{m}\) diameter Mount Palomar telescope be able to resolve these bodies when they are \(4.50 \times 10^{9} \, \(\textrm{km}\) from Earth? Assume an average wavelength of \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\). 

$PAR

The telescope should be able to discern a separation at : \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\textrm{m}\).

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Is the telescope's ability to resolve more closely related to how far the bodies are from the telescope itself, or how far the bodies are from each other?
