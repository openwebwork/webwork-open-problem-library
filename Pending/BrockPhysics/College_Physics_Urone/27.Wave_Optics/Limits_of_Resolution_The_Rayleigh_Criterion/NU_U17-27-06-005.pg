$PAR
A telescope can be used to enlarge the diameter of a laser beam and limit diffraction spreading. The laser beam is sent through the telescope in opposite the normal direction and can then be projected onto a satellite or the Moon.


$PAR

a) If this is done with the Mount Wilson telescope, producing a \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) diameter beam of \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) light, what is the minimum angular spread of the beam?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{rad}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Neglecting atmospheric effects, what is the size of the spot this beam would make on the Moon, assuming a lunar distance of \(3.84 \times 10^{8} \, \(\textrm{m}\)?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
