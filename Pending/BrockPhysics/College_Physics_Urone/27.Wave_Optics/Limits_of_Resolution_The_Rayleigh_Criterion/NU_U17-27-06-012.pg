$PAR
An amateur astronomer wants to build a telescope with a diffraction limit that will allow him to see if there are people on the moons of Jupiter. What diameter mirror is needed to be able to see \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{m}\) detail on a Jovian Moon at a distance of \(7.50 \times 10^{8} \, \(\textrm{km}\) from Earth? The wavelength of light averages \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\).
