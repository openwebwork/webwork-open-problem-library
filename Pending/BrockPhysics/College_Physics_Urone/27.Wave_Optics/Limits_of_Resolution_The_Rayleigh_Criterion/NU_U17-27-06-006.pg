$PAR
The limit to the eye's acuity is actually related to diffraction by the pupil. 

$PAR

a) What is the angle between two just-resolvable points of light for a \($d \, \(\textrm{mm}\) diameter pupil, assuming an average wavelength of \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\)? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{rad}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Take your result to be the practical limit for the eye. What is the greatest possible distance a car can be from you if you can resolve its two headlights, given they are \(1.30 \, \(\textrm{m}\) apart?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What is the distance between two just-resolvable points held at an arm's length of \(0.800 \, \(\textrm{m}\) from your eye?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
What approximation can you make for small angles?
