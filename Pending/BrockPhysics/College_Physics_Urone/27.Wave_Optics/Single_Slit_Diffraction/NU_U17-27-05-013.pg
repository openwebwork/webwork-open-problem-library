A water break at the entrance to a harbor consists of a rock barrier with a \($width \, \textrm{m}\) wide opening. Ocean waves of \($wave \, \textrm{m}\) wavelength approach the opening straight on. At what angle to the incident direction are the boats inside the harbor most protected against wave action?

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
If the boat is to be protected should you try to find a minimum or maximum? What order?
