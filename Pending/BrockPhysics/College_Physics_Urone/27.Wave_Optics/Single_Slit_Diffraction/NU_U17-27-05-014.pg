An aircraft maintenance technician walks past a tall hangar door that acts like a single slit for sound entering the hangar. Outside the door, on a line perpendicular to the opening in the door, a jet engine makes a \($freq \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) sound. At what angle with the door will the technician observe the first minimum in sound intensity if the vertical opening is \($width \, \(\textrm{m}\) wide and the speed of sound is \(340 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?
