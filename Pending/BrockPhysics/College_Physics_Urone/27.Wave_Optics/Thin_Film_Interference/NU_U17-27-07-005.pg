$PAR



A film of soapy water (\(\textrm{n}\) = \(1.33\) ) on top of a plastic cutting board has a thickness of \($thick \, \(\textrm{nm}\). What wavelength is most strongly reflected if it is illuminated perpendicular to its surface?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{nm}\)

BEGIN_HINT
As the wave transverses through these media how many phase shifts will it incur?
