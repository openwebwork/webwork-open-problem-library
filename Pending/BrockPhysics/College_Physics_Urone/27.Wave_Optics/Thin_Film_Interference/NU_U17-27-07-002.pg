An oil slick on water is \($thick \, \(\textrm{nm}\) thick and illuminated by white light incident perpendicular to its surface. What color does the oil appear (what is the most constructively reflected wavelength), given its index of refraction is \(1.40\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the index of refraction, would you expect a phase change to occur?
