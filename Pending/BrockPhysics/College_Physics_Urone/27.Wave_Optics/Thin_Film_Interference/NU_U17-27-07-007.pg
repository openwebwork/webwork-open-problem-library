$PAR

Suppose you have a lens system that is to be used primarily for \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) light. What is the second thinnest coating of fluorite (magnesium fluoride) (\(\textrm{n}\) = \(1.38\) ) that would be non-reflective for this wavelength?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{nm}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the number of phase changes which occur.
