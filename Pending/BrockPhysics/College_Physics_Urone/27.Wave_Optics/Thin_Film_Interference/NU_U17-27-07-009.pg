$PAR

A film of oil on water will appear dark when it is very thin, because the path length difference becomes small compared with the wavelength of light and there is a phase shift at the top surface. If it becomes dark when the path length difference is less than one-fourth the wavelength, what is the thickest the oil can be and appear dark at all visible wavelengths? Oil has an index of refraction of \(1.40\).

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the thickness of oil is equal to half of the path length (due to reflection).
