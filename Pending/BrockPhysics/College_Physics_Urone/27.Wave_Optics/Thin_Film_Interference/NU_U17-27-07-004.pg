<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR


Find the minimum thickness of a soap bubble that appears red when illuminated by white light perpendicular to its surface. Take the wavelength to be \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\), and assume the same index of refraction as water (\(1.33\)).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{nm}\)

What phase change (if any) would occur for the minimum thickness?
