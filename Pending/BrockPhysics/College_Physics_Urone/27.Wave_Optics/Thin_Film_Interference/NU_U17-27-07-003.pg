$wave = random(380,760,0.1);

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR


Calculate the minimum thickness of an oil slick on water that appears blue when illuminated by white light perpendicular to its surface. Take the wavelength to be \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) and the index of refraction of oil to be \(1.40\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the index of refraction, would you expect a phase change to occur?
