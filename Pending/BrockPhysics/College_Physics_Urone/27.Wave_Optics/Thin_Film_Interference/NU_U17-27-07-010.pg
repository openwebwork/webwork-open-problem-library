$PAR


In a lab, two glass slides are illuminated by pure-wavelength light incident perpendicularly. The top slide touches the bottom slide at one end and rests on a \($d \, \(\textrm{mm}\) diameter hair at the other end, forming a wedge of air. How far apart are the dark bands, if the slides are \($long \, \(\textrm{cm}\) long and \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) light is used?
