$PAR


Two \($long \, \(\textrm{cm}\) long glass slides are illuminated by pure \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) wavelength light incident perpendicularly. The top slide touches the bottom slide at one end and rests on some debris at the other end, forming a wedge of air. How thick is the debris, if the dark bands are \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{mm}\) apart?
