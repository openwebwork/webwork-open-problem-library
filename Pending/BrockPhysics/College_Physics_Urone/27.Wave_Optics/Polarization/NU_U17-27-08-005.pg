$PAR
The intensity of polarized light is reduced to \(90.0 \, \(\textrm{%}\) of its original value by passing through a polarizing filter with its axis at an angle of  \(18.4^\circ\) to the direction of polarization. Verify this statement.
$PAR
Enter the equivalence statement. If you need to raise \(\textrm{cos}\)\(\theta\) to an exponent, put the entire term in parentheses. Enter angle \(\theta\) as "\(\textrm{x}\)".
$PAR
\(\textrm{I}\)/\(\textrm{I}\)<sub>o</sub> = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Now substitute an angle of \(18.4^\circ\) into the expression above (recall that WebWorks evaluates in radians);
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Express this value as a percent with two significant figures;
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)
