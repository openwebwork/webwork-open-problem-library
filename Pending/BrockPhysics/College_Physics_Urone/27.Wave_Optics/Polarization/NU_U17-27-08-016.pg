$angle = random(10,40,0.1);

$A1 = (1)/((cos(($angle)*(pi/180)))**(2));

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Suppose you put on two pairs of Polaroid sunglasses with their axes at an angle of \($angle^{\circ}\) . How much longer will it take the light to deposit a given amount of energy in your eye compared with a single pair of sunglasses? Assume the lenses are clear except for their polarizing characteristics.

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Express the ratios of intensity in terms of time, where the time corresponding to initial intensity would be less than time required for the second intensity.
