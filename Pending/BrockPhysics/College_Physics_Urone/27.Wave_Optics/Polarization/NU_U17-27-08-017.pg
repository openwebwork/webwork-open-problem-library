$PAR
On a day when the intensity of sunlight is \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{kW/m}^2\), a circular lens \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) in diameter focuses light onto water in a black beaker. Two polarizing sheets of plastic are placed in front of the lens with their axes at an angle of \($angle^{\circ}\). Assuming the sunlight is unpolarized and the polarizers are \(100 \, \(\textrm{%}\)  efficient, what is the initial rate of heating of the water in \(^{\circ}\textrm{C/s}\) , assuming it is \(80 \, \(\textrm{%}\)  absorbed? The aluminum beaker has a mass of \($mass\) grams and contains \($volume\) grams of water.
