What is the ratio of thicknesses of crown glass and water that would contain the same number of wavelengths of light? Crown glass has an index of refraction equal to \(1.52\) and water has an index of refraction equal to \(1.333\).

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Is there a formula regarding index of refraction which may be used to form a ratio? Keep in mind, when creating ratios you want to be able to divide out unknowns.
