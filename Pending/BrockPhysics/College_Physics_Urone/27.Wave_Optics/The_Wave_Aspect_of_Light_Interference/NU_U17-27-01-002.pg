Find the range of visible wavelengths of light in crown glass. Crown glass has an index of refraction equal to \(1.52\) and visible light has a wavelength range from \(380\) to \(760 \, \(\textrm{nm}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(10)\} \(\textrm{nm}\) to \{ans_rule(10)\} \(\textrm{nm}\)

BEGIN_HINT
How would you expect wavelength to change, if at all, when entering a substance with a higher index of refraction from a lower index?
