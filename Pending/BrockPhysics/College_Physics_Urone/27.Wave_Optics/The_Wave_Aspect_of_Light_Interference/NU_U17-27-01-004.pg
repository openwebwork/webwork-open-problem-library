Analysis of an interference effect in a clear solid shows that the wavelength of light in the solid is \($a \, \(\textrm{nm}\). Knowing this light comes from a He-Ne laser and has a wavelength of \($b \, \(\textrm{nm}\) in air, find the index of refraction.

BEGIN_HINT
How would you calculate wavelength as light passes into a different refractive index?
