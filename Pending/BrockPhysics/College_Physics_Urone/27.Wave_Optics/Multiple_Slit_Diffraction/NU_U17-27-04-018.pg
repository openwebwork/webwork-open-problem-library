$PAR
A Heâ€“Ne laser beam is reflected from the surface of a CD onto a wall. The brightest spot is the reflected beam at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. However, fringes are also observed. If the wall is \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) from the CD, and the first fringe is \($fringe \, \(\textrm{m}\) from the central maximum, what is the spacing of grooves on the CD? The He-Ne laser has a wavelength of \(633 \, \(\textrm{nm}\).
