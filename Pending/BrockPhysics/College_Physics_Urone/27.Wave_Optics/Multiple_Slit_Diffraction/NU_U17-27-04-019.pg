BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What is the distance between fringes produced by a diffraction grating having \($lines\) lines per centimeter for \($wave \, \(\textrm{nm}\) light, if the screen is \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) away?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the different ways by which \(\textrm{sin}\)\(\theta\) can be calculated.
