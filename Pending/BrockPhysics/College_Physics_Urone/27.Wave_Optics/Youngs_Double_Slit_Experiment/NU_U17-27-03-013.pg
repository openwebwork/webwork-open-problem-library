$PAR
The figure above shows a double slit located a distance \(\textrm{x}\) from a screen, with the distance from the centre of the screen given by \(\textrm{y}\). When the distance \(\textrm{d}\) between the slits is relatively large, there will be numerous bright spots, called fringes. Show that, for small angles (where \(\textrm{sin}\)(\(\theta\)) is approximately equal to \(\theta\), with \(\theta\) in radians), the distance between fringes is given by \(\Delta\)\(\textrm{y}\) = \(\textrm{x}\)\(\lambda\)/\(\textrm{d}\).
$PAR
For small angles \(\textrm{sin}\)(\(\theta\)) = \(\textrm{tan}\)(\(\theta\)) = \(\theta\)
$PAR
For two adjacent fringes, enter \(\lambda\) as \(\textrm{w}\) and \(\textrm{m}\) as \(\textrm{m}\);
$PAR
\(\textrm{dsin}\)\(\theta\)<sub>m</sub> = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
\(\textrm{dsin}\)\(\theta\)<sub>m+1</sub> = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Subtracting the two equations gives;
$PAR
\(\textrm{d}\)(\(\textrm{sin}\)\(\theta\)<sub>m+1</sub> - \(\textrm{sin}\)\(\theta\)<sub>m</sub>)= \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
\(\textrm{d}\)(\(\theta\)<sub>m+1</sub> - \(\theta\)<sub>m</sub>) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Entering \(\textrm{x}\) and \(\textrm{y}\) as their respective side lengths, \(\textrm{tan}\)\(\theta\)<sub>m</sub> = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
\(\lambda\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
\(\Delta\)\(\textrm{y}\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
