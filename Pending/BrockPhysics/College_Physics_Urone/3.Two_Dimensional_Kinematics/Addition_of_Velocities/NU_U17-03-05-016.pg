BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Solve the following problem using analytical techniques: Suppose you walk \(18.0\,\textrm{m}\) straight west and then \(25.0\,\textrm{m}\) straight north.
$PAR

a) How far are you from your starting point, and

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees West of North}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
If you represent the two legs of the walk as vector displacements \( A \) and \( B \), as shown below, then this problem asks you to find their sum \( R=A+B \).
