$PAR
A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail \( 27.5 \,\textrm{m} \) in a direction \( 66.0^\circ\) north of east from her current location, and then travel \( 30.0 \,\textrm{m}\) in a direction \( 112^\circ \) north of east (or \(22.0^\circ\) west of north).
$PAR
What is the resulting displacement?
