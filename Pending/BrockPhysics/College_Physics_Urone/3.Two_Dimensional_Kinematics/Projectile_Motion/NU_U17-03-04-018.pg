$PAR
The world long jump record is \(8.95 \, \(\textrm{m}\) (Mike Powell, USA, 1991). Treated as a projectile, what is the maximum range obtainable by a person if he has a take-off speed of \(9.5 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?
$PA
Assume the motion is on level ground (the person leaves the ground at ground height) and the angle is \(45^\circ\).
