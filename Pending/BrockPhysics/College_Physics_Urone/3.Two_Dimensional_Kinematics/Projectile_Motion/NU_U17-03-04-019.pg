$PAR
a) Serving at a speed of \($v\,\textrm{km/h}\) a tennis player hits the ball at a height of \($h\,\textrm{m}\) and an angle \(\theta\) below the horizontal. The baseline from which the ball is served is \($d\,\textrm{m}\) from the net, which is \($n\,\textrm{m}\) high. What is the angle  such that the ball just crosses the net?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees below the horizontal}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Will the ball land in the service box, which has an outermost service line \(6.40\,\textrm{m}\) from the net?
$PAR
Enter "yes" or "no"

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

c) What is the difference between the distance from the player to the net, and the distance from the player to where the ball lands?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations as well as trigonometric problem solving strategies.
