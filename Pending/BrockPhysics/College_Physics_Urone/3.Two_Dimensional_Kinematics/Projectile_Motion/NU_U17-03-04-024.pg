$PAR
Suppose a soccer player kicks the ball from a distance \($d\,\textrm{m}\) toward the goal. Find the initial speed of the ball if the peak of its arc just passes over the goal, \($hg\,\textrm{m}\) above the ground, given the initial direction to be \($deg^\circ\) above the horizontal.

BEGIN_HINT
Consider trigonometric problem solving strategies as well as the fundamental kinematics equations in order to solve this problem.
