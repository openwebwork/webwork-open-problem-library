BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
An archer shoots an arrow at a \($d \,\textrm{m}\) distant target; the bull's-eye of the target is at same height as the release height of the arrow.
$PAR

a) At what angle must the arrow be released to hit the bull's-eye if its initial speed is \($v\,\textrm{m/s}\)?

$PAR 

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees above the horizontal}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$p1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) There is a large tree halfway between the archer and the target with an overhanging horizontal branch \(3.50\,\textrm{m}\) above the release height of the arrow. Will the arrow go over or under the branch?
$PAR
Enter "over" or "under"

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}


$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(str_cmp("over"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations or the range equation to solve this problem.
$PAR
Where will the arrow reach its maximum height?
