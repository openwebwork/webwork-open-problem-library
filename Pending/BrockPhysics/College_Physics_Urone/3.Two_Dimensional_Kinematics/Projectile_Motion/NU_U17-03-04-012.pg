$PAR
A rugby player passes the ball \($d\,\textrm{m}\) across the field, where it is caught at the same height as it left his hand.
$PAR

a) At what angle was the ball thrown if its initial speed was \($v\,\textrm{m/s}\), assuming that the smaller of the two possible angles was used?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees above the horizontal}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What other angle gives the same range, and why would it not be used?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees above the horizontal}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) How long did this pass take?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations or the range equation as well as trigonometric problem solving strategies to answer this question.
