<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Gun sights are adjusted to aim high to compensate for the effect of gravity, effectively making the gun accurate only for a specific range.
$PAR
If a gun is sighted to hit targets that are at the same height as the gun and \(100.0 \, \(\textrm{m}\) away, how low will the bullet hit if aimed directly at a target \($d.0 \, \(\textrm{m}\) away? The muzzle velocity of the bullet is \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m below the target}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider drawing a diagram of the bullet's path. Use the information from the \(\100 \, \(\textrm{m}\) shot to calculate the release angle for the bullet.
