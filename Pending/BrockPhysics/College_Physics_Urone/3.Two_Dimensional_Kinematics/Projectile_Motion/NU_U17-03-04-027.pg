$PAR
In 2007, Michael Carter (U.S.) set a world record in the shot put with a throw of \(24.77 \, \(\textrm{m}\).
$PAR
What was the initial speed of the shot if he released it at a height of \(2.10 \, \(\textrm{m}\) and threw it at an angle of \(38.0^\circ\) above the horizontal?
$PAR
(Although the maximum distance for a projectile on level ground is achieved at  when air resistance is neglected, the actual angle to achieve maximum range is smaller; thus, will give a longer range than  in the shot put.)
