You fly \($d.0\,\textrm{km}\) in a straight line in still air in the direction \($t.0^\circ\) south of west.

a) Find the distances you would have to fly straight south and then straight west to arrive at the same point.

b) Find the distances you would have to fly first directly south-west and then directly north-west.
