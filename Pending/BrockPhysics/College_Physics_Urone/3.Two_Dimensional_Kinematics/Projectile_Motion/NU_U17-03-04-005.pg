$PAR
In an attempt to escape his island, Gilligan builds a raft and sets to sea. The wind shifts a great deal during the day, and he is blown along the following straight lines:
$PAR
\(2.50\,\textrm{km,}\,45.0^\circ\) north of west; then \(4.70\,\textrm{km,}\,60.0^\circ\) south of east; then \(1.30\,\textrm{km,}\,25.0^\circ\) south of west; then \(5.10\,\textrm{km,}\) east; then \(1.70\,\textrm{km,}\,5.00^\circ\) east of north; then \(7.2\,\textrm{km,}\,55.0^\circ\) south of west; then \(2.80\,\textrm{km,}\,10.0^\circ\) north of east. What is his final position relative to his starting point?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km}\)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees East of North}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Consider trigonometric problem solving strategies and looking at the North/South and East/West components of each vector.
