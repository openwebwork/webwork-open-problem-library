$PAR
The cannon on a battleship can fire a shell a maximum distance of \(32.0\,\textrm{km}\).
$PAR

a) Calculate the initial velocity of the shell.

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What maximum height does it reach? (At its highest, the shell is above \(60%\) of the atmosphereâ€”but air resistance is not really negligible as assumed to make this problem easier.)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) The ocean is not flat, because the Earth is curved. Assume that the radius of the Earth is \(6.37\times10^3\textrm{km}\). How many meters lower will its surface be \(32.0\textrm{km}\) from the ship along a horizontal line parallel to the surface at the ship? Does your answer imply that error introduced by the assumption of a flat Earth in projectile motion is significant here?

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations or the range equation as well as trigonometric problem solving strategies to answer this question.
