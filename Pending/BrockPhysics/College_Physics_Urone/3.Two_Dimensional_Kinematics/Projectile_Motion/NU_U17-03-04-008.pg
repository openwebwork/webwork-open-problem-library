$PAR
A ball is kicked with an initial velocity of \($h\,\textrm{m/s}\) in the horizontal direction and \($v\,\textrm{m/s}\) in the vertical direction.
$PAR

a) At what speed does the ball hit the ground?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$a"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) For how long does the ball remain in the air?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$b"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c)What maximum height is attained by the ball?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$c"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider trigonometric problem solving strategies as well as the fundamental kinematics equations.
