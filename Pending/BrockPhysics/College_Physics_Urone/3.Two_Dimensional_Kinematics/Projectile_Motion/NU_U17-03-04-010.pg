$PAR
A daredevil is attempting to jump his motorcycle over a line of buses parked end to end by driving up a   \($a^\circ\) ramp at a speed of \($v\,\textrm{m/s}\).
$PAR
How many buses can he clear if the top of the takeoff ramp is at the same height as the bus tops and the buses are \(20.0 \, \(\textrm{m}\) long?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} buses

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$N"));


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations or the range equation. Remember to give your answer in units of buses.
