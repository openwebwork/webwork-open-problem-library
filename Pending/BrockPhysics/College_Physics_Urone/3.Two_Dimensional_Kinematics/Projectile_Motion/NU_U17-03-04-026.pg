$PAR
The free throw line in basketball is \($d\,\textrm{m}\) (\(15 \, \(\textrm{ft}\)) from the basket, which is \($h\,\textrm{m}\) (\(10 \, \(\textrm{ft}\)) above the floor. A player standing on the free throw line throws the ball with an initial speed of \($vo\,\textrm{m/s}\), releasing it at a height of \($ho\,\textrm{m}\) (\(8 \, \(\textrm{ft}\)) above the floor. At what angle above the horizontal must the ball be thrown to exactly hit the basket?
$PAR
Note that most players will use a large initial angle rather than a flat shot because it allows for a larger margin of error.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees above the horizontal}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the quadratic formula when solving this problem. Use the larger angle result.
