a) Suppose you walk \($x.0\,\textrm{m}\) straight west and then \($y.0\,\textrm{m}\) straight south.
$PAR
How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees South of West}\)

b) Suppose you walk \(25.0\,\textrm{m}\) straight south and then \(18.0\,\textrm{m}\) straight east.
$PAR
How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?

BEGIN_HINT
If you represent the two legs of the walk as vector displacements \( A \) and \( B \), as shown below, then this problem asks you to find their sum \( R=A+B \).
