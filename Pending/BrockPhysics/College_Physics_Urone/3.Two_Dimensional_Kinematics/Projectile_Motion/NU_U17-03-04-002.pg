A new landowner has a triangular piece of flat land she wishes to fence. Starting at the west corner, she measures the first side to be \(80.0\,\textrm{m}\) long and the next to be \(105\,\textrm{m}\). These sides are represented as displacement vectors A and B in the above. She then correctly calculates the length and orientation of the third side, C. What is her result?

BEGIN_HINT
It may be helpful to draw the diagram, then apply trigonometric formulas to solve for the missing angles.
