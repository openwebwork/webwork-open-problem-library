<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
In the standing broad jump, one squats and then pushes off with the legs to see how far one can jump. Suppose the extension of the legs from the crouch position is \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) and the acceleration achieved from this position is \($c \, \(\textrm{times}\)  the acceleration due to gravity,  . How far can they jump? State your assumptions. (Increased range can be achieved by swinging the arms in the direction of the jump.)

ANS(num_cmp("$A"));

BEGIN_HINT
Assume that the person leaves at \(45^\circ\) above the horizontal and on level ground, thus \(v_{fy}=v_{oy}+at\).
