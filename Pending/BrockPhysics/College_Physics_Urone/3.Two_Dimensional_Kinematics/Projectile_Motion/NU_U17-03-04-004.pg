$PAR
A farmer wants to fence off his four-sided plot of flat land. He measures the first three sides, shown as A, B and C in the above image, and then correctly calculates the length and orientation of the fourth side D. What is his result?
$PAR

Length:
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
Orientation:

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees West of South}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Imagine the farmer walking around the edge of his property. Side D would be his displacement from C back to A, giving his trip a total displacement of \(0\) \(\textrm{km}\).
