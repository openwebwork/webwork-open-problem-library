b) If you extrapolate back in time, how long ago would all of the galaxies have been at approximately the same position?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{years}\)

$PAR
The two parts of this problem give you some idea of how the Hubble constant for universal expansion and the time back to the Big Bang are determined, respectively.

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to take the average of the values found from each galaxy in order to find the answer in part a).
