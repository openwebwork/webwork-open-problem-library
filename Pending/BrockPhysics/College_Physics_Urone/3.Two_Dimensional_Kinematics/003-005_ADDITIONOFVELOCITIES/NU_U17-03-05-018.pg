$PAR
A commercial airplane has an air speed of \($va,\textrm{m/s}\) due east and flies with a strong tailwind. It travels \($d\,\textrm{km}\) in a direction \($a^\circ\) south of east in \(1.50\,\textrm{h}\).
$PAR

a) What was the velocity of the plane relative to the ground?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}\(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the tailwind's velocity.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees South of East}\)
$PAR
Is this reasonable?

BEGIN_HINT
Consider trigonometric problem solving strategies such as the Pythagorean theorem in order to solve this problem.
