$PAR
A ship sets sail from Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The local
ocean current is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in a direction \($degw^\circ\) north of east.
$PAR

a) In what direction would the ship have to travel in order to have a velocity straight north relative to the Earth, assuming the boat's speed relative to the water remains \($vb\,\(\textrm{m/s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees West of North}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));


BEGIN_TEXT
b) What would its speed be relative to the Earth?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));


BEGIN_HINT
Consider the symmetry required in the east-west component of the two velocities to have it equal zero.
