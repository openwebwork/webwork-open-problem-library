$PAR
A jet stream is blowing at \(45.0 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in a direction \(20.0^\circ\) south of east. An airplane moves in a direction \(45.0^\circ\) south of west relative to Earth, and its direction of motion relative to the air is \(5.00^\circ\) south of west.
$PAR

a) What is the airplane's speed relative to the air?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
