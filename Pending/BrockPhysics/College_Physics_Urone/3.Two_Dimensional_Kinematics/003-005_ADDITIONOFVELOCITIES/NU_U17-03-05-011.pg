$PAR
The velocity of the wind relative to the water is crucial to sailboats. Suppose a sailboat is in an ocean current that has a velocity of \($s\,\textrm{m/s}\) in a direction \($b^\circ\) east of north relative to the Earth. It encounters a wind that has a velocity of \($v\,\textrm{m/s}\) in a direction of \($a^\circ\) south of west relative to the Earth. What is the velocity of the wind relative to the water?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees South of West}\)
