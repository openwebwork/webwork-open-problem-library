$PAR
An athlete crosses a \($w\,\textrm{m-wide}\) river by swimming perpendicular to the water current at a speed of \($s\,\textrm{m/s}\) relative to the water. He reaches the opposite side at a distance \($d\,\textrm{m}\) downstream from his starting point.
$PAR

a) How fast is the water in the river flowing with respect to the ground?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the speed of the swimmer with respect to a friend at rest on the ground?

BEGIN_HINT
Consider trigonometric problem solving strategies in order to answer this question.
