<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose you wish to shoot supplies straight up to astronauts in an orbit \(36,000 \, \(\textrm{km}\) above the surface of the Earth. At what velocity must the supplies be launched supposing that \(g=9.80\) is valid for the whole flight.
$PAR


\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km/s}\)
$PAR
Is this reasonable?

BEGIN_HINT
Sara, please add a hint. I can't think of one.
