$PAR
Bryan Allen pedaled a human-powered aircraft across the English Channel from the cliffs of Dover to Cap Gris-Nez on June 12, 1979.
$PAR

a) He flew for \(169 \, \(\textrm{min}\) at an average velocity of \(3.53 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in a direction south of east. What was his total displacement?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km south-east}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT
ANS(num_cmp("$A"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Allen encountered a headwind averaging \(2.00 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) almost precisely in the opposite direction of his motion relative to the Earth. What was his average velocity relative to the air?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km south-east}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT
ANS(num_cmp("$B"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What was his total displacement relative to the air mass?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km south-east}\)
END_TEXT
ANS(num_cmp("$C"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations to solve this problem.
