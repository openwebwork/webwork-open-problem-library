<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A basketball player is running at  \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) directly toward the basket when he jumps into the air to dunk the ball. He maintains his horizontal velocity.
$PAR

a) What vertical velocity does he need to rise \(0.750 \, \(\textrm{m}\) above the floor?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How far from the basket (measured in the horizontal direction) must he start his jump to reach his maximum height at the same time as he reaches the basket?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the peak of the basketball player's jump is where his vertical velocity is momentarily 0.
$PAR
What is his acceleration during the jump?
