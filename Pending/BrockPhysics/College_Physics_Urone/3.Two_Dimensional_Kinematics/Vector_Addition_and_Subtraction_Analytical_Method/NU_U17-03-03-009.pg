$PAR
Near the end of a marathon race, the first two runners are separated by a distance of \($d1\textrm{m}\). The front runner has a velocity of \($vf\textrm{m/s}\), and the second a velocity of \($vs\textrm{m/s}\).
$PAR

a) What is the velocity of the second runner relative to the first?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If the front runner is \($d2\textrm{m}\) from the finish line, who will win the race, assuming they run at constant velocity?
$PAR
Enter "first" for the first runner or "second" for the second runner.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(str_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What distance ahead will the winner be when she crosses the finish line? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations.
