$PAR
A football player punts the ball at a \(45^\circ\) angle. Without an effect from the wind, the ball would travel \($d.0 \, \(\textrm{m}\) horizontally.
$PAR

a) What is the initial speed of the ball?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) When the ball is near its maximum height it experiences a brief gust of wind that reduces its horizontal velocity by \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\). What distance does the ball travel horizontally?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Can you use the fundamental kinematics equations to find a formula for range?
