$PAR
A football quarterback is moving straight backward at a speed of \($v\,\textrm{m/s}\) when he throws a pass to a player \($d\,\textrm{m}\) straight downfield. The ball is thrown at an angle of \($a^\circ\) relative to the ground and is caught at the same height as it is released. What is the initial velocity of the ball relative to the quarterback?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));
ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the quarterback's velocity only affects the x-component of the ball's velocity.
$PAR
Consider trigonometric problem solving strategies in order to find the angle.
