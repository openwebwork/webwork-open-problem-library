$PAR

Compare the rate of heat conduction through a \($dcmwall\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-thick wall that has an area of \($Awall\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and a thermal conductivity twice that of glass wool with the rate of heat conduction through a window that is \($dcmwindow\) \(\textrm{cm}\) thick and that has an area of \($Awindow\) \(\textrm{m}^2\), assuming the same temperature difference across each.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{wall : window}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for thermal conduction. Can you express the temperature difference as two independent functions, one of the window conduction parameters and the other of those of the wall? If so, you can can equate and rearrange them as required.
