One easy way to reduce heating (and cooling) costs is to add extra insulation in the attic of a house. Suppose the house already had \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) of fiberglass insulation in the attic and in all the exterior surfaces. If you added an extra \(8.0\) \(\textrm{cm}\) of fiberglass to the attic, then by what percentage would the heating cost of the house drop? Take the single story house to be of dimensions \($l\) \(\textrm{m}\) by \($w\) \(\textrm{m}\) by \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\). Ignore air infiltration and heat loss through windows and doors. Assume that the floor is also insulated.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for thermal conduction. Are you sure you need to know the temperature difference (or even the thermal conductivity, for that matter)?
