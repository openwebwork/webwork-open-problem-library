<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the rate of heat conduction through the \($dcm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-thick fur of a large animal having a \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) surface area? Assume that the animal's skin temperature is \($T2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), that the air temperature is \($T1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and that fur has the same thermal conductivity as air. 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for thermal conduction.

b) What food intake will the animal need in one day to replace this heat transfer?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for energy, given the power found in part (a) and the time elapsed?
