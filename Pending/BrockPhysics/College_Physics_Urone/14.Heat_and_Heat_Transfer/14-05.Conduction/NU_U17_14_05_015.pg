$PAR

For the human body, what is the rate of heat transfer by conduction through the body's tissue with the following conditions: the tissue thickness is \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\), the change in temperature is \($T^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and the skin area is \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\). How does this compare with the average heat transfer rate to the body resulting from an energy intake of about \(2400\) \(\textrm{kcal}\) per day? (No exercise is included).
