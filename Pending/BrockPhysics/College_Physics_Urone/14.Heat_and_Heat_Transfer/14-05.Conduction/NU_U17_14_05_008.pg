A walrus transfers energy by conduction through its blubber at the rate of \($Qt\) \(\textrm{W}\) when immersed in \($T1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water. The walrus's internal core temperature is \($T2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and it has a surface area of \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\). What is the average thickness of its blubber, which has the conductivity of fatty tissues without blood?
