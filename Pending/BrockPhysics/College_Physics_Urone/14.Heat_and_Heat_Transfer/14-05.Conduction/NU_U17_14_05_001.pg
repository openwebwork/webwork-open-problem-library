$PAR

Calculate the rate of heat conduction through house walls that are \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) thick and that have an average thermal conductivity twice that of glass wool. Assume there are no windows or doors. The surface area of the walls is \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and their inside surface is at \($T2 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), while their outside surface is at \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).
