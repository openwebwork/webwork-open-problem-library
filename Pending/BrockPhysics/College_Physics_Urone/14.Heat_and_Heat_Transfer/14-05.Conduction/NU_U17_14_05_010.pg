$PAR

Suppose a person is covered head to foot by wool clothing with average thickness of
\($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) and is transferring energy by conduction through the clothing at the rate of
\($Qt\) \(\textrm{W}\). What is the temperature difference across the clothing, given the surface
area is \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\)?
