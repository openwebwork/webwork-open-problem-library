$PAR

Suppose you stand with one foot on ceramic flooring and one foot on a wool carpet, making contact over an area of \($Acm\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\) with each foot. Both the ceramic and the carpet are \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) thick and are \($T1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) on their bottom sides. Take the thermal conductivity of ceramic to be that same as that of concrete.

$PAR

a) At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the ceramic at \($T2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

BEGIN_HINT
For each of (a) and (b), recall the formula for thermal conduction.
