$PAR

(a) Calculate the rate of heat conduction through a double-paned window that has a \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) area and is made of two panes of \($d1cm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-thick glass separated by a \($d2cm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\) air gap. The inside surface temperature is \($T2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), while that on the outside is \($T1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\\). Ignore the increased heat transfer in the air gap due to convection.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For all the given temperatures to remain constant, it must be that an equal amount of power is transmitted through both glass panes as well as the air gap. Can you write and solve a system of three equations whose unknown variables are the power and the temperatures of the glass pane-air gap interfaces, recalling the formula for thermal conduction?

b) Calculate the rate of heat conduction through a \($d3cm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-thick window of the same area and with the same temperatures.
