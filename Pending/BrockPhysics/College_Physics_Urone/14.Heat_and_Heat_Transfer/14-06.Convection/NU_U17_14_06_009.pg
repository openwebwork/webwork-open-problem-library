$PAR

A person inhales and exhales \($VL\) \(\textrm{L}\) of \($T2 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) air, evaporating \($mg \times 10^{-2}\) \(\textrm{g}\) of water from the lungs and breathing passages with each breath. 

$PAR

a) How much heat transfer occurs due to evaporation in each breath?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given that the water evaporates at body temperature, which value of the heat of vaporization should be used?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

b) What is the rate of heat transfer in watts if the person is breathing at a moderate rate of \($N\) breaths per minute?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$Pb"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) If the inhaled air had a temperature of \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), what is the rate of heat transfer for warming the air?

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Is the process of air expanding in the lungs one occurring under conditions of constant volume or constant pressure? How might this affect the specific heat of air?
