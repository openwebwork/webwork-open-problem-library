The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii is the world's most active, disgorging about \($Va \times 10^5\) \(\textrm{m}^3\) of \($T2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) lava per day. What is the rate of heat transfer out of Earth by convection if this lava has a density of \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\) and eventually cools to \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? Assume that the specific heat of lava is the same as that of granite.

BEGIN_HINT
Note the problem requires the <i>rate</i> of heat transfer. Can you think of an equation that relates energy and time?
