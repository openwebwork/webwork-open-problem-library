One winter day, the climate control system of a large university classroom building malfunctions. As a result, \($V\) \(\textrm{m}^3\) of excess cold air is brought in each minute. At what rate in kilowatts must heat transfer occur to warm this air by \($T^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) (that is, to bring the air to room temperature)?

BEGIN_HINT
Is the process of warming the air one occurring under conditions of constant pressure or constant volume? How might this affect the specific heat capacity of air?
