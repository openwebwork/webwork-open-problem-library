How many kilograms of water must evaporate from a \($M\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) woman to lower her
body temperature by \($T^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat required for evaporation with that lost by the woman's body? What value for the heat of vaporization of water should be used, given that evaporation occurs at body temperature?
