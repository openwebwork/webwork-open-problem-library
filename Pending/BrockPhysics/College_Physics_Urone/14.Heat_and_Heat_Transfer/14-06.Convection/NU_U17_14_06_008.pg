$PAR

During heavy exercise, the body pumps \($VL\) \(\textrm{L}\) of blood per minute to the surface,
where it is cooled by \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What is the rate of heat transfer from this forced
convection alone, assuming blood has the same specific heat as water and its density
is \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Note the problem requires the <i>rate</i> of heat transfer. Can you think of an equation that relates energy and time?
