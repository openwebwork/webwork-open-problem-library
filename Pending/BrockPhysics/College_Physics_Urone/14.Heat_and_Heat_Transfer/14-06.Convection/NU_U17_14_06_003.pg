$PAR

The “steam” above a freshly made cup of instant coffee is really water vapour droplets condensing after evaporating from the hot coffee. What is the final temperature of \($mc\) \(\textrm{g}\) of hot coffee initially at \($Ti^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) if \($me\) \(\textrm{g}\) evaporates from it? The coffee is in a Styrofoam cup, so other methods of heat transfer can be neglected. Assume the coffee has the same thermal properties of water.

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat required for evaporation with that lost by the coffee? Does the mass of the coffee change at any point throughout this process?
