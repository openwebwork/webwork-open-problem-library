$PAR

On a hot, \(37^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) dry day, evaporation from a lake has just enough heat transfer to balance the \(1.00\) \(\textrm{kW/m}^2\) of incoming heat from the Sun. What mass of water evaporates in \(1.00\) \(\textrm{h}\) from each square meter?

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat required for evaporation with that lost by the lake? What value for the heat of vaporization of water should be used, given that evaporation occurs at body temperature?
