$PAR

A glass coffee pot has a circular bottom with a \($dcm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\) diameter in contact with a heating element that keeps the coffee warm with a continuous heat transfer rate of \($P\) \(\textrm{W}\).

$PAR

a) What is the temperature of the bottom of the pot, if it is \($dmm\) \(\textrm{W}\) thick and the inside temperature is \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$T"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If the temperature of the coffee remains constant and all of the heat transfer is removed by evaporation, how many grams per minute evaporate? Take the heat of vaporization to be \($Lv\) \(\textrm{kJ/kg}\).


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For the temperature of the coffee to remain constant, it can receive no net inflow of heat. Can you develop an expression equating the heat flowing in from the stove element to that evaporated away?
