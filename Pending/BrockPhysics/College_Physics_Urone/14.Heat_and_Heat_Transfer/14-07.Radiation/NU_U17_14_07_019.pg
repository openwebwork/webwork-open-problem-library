Integrated Concepts: Heat transfers from your lungs and breathing passages by
evaporating water. 

$PAR

a) Calculate the maximum number of grams of water that can be evaporated when you inhale \(1.50\) \(\textrm{L}\) of \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) air with an original relative humidity of \(40.0\)\(\textrm{%}\). Assume that body temperature is also \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
How much more water is in a breath exhaled into \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) air at \(100\)\(\textrm{%}\) relative humidity than is in a breath inhaled at the given relative humidity?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$m"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How many joules of energy are required to evaporate this amount? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What value should be used for the heat of vaporization of water, given that it evaporates at body temperature?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What is the rate of heat transfer in watts from this method, if you breathe at a normal resting rate of \($N\) breaths per minute?


$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall average power (in Watts) is defined as the change in energy (in joules) over the change in time (in seconds).
