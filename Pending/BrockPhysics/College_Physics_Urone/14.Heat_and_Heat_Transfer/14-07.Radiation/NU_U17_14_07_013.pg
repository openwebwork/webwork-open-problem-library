<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Integrated Concepts: Large meteors sometimes strike the Earth, converting most of
their kinetic energy into thermal energy. 

$PAR

a) What is the kinetic energy of a \($M \times 10^9\) \(\textrm{kg}\) meteor moving at \($vkm\) \(\textrm{km/s}\)? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Recall kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the object's velocity, in units of \(\textrm{m/s}\).
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$KE"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) If this meteor lands in a deep ocean and \(80\)\(\textrm{%}\) of its kinetic energy goes into heating water, how many kilograms of water could it raise by \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Given that heat is a form of energy, can you derive an expression equating the kinetic energy of the meteor with the thermal energy absorbed by the ocean water?
