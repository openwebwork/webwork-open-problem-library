Integrated Concepts: A \($m\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) person suffering from hypothermia comes indoors and shivers vigorously. How long does it take the heat transfer to increase the person's body temperature by \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) if all other forms of heat transfer are balanced?

BEGIN_HINT
You will need to research what amount of power, in watts, is generated by a person shivering.
