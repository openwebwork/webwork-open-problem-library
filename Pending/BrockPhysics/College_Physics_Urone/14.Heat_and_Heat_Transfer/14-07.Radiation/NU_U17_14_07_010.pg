$PAR

Calculate the temperature the entire sky would have to be in order to transfer energy
by radiation at \($QtA \textrm{W/m}^2\)â€”about the rate at which the Sun radiates when it is directly overhead on a clear day. This value is the effective temperature of the sky, a kind of average that takes account of the fact that the Sun occupies only a small part
of the sky but is much hotter than the rest. Assume that the body receiving the energy
has a temperature of \($T2C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Note the energy transfer is given in units of <i>intensity</i> - power per unit area. In calculating the effective temperature of the sky, can the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation be rearranged such that you end up with the quotient of power and area?
