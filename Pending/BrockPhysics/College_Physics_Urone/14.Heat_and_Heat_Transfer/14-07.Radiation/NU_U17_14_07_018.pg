Integrated Concepts: In certain large geographic regions, the underlying rock is hot. Wells can be drilled and water circulated through the rock for heat transfer for the generation of electricity. 

$PAR

a) Calculate the heat transfer that can be extracted by cooling \(1.00\) \(\textrm{km}^3\) of granite by \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

BEGIN_HINT
You will need to determine the density of granite in order to make the appropriate substitution for mass.

b) How long will this take if heat is transferred at a rate of \($PMW\) \(\textrm{MW}\), assuming no heat transfers back into \(1.00\) \(\textrm{km}^3\) the of rock by its surroundings?
