$PAR

Find the net rate of heat transfer by radiation from a skier standing in the shade, given the following: she is completely clothed in white (head to foot, including a ski mask), the clothes have an emissivity of \($e\) and a surface temperature of \($T1C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), the surroundings are at \($T2C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and her surface area is \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation requires the temperatures be converted into units of Kelvin.
