Integrated Concepts: A large electrical power facility produces \($QMW\) \(\textrm{MW}\) of “waste heat,” which is dissipated to the environment in cooling towers by warming air flowing through the towers by \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). What is the necessary flow rate of air in \(\textrm{m}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Note the question asks for a <i>volume flow rate </i> - volume per unit time. Can you rearrange the definition of average power such that you end up with the quotient of volume and time, assuming the air is warmed under conditions of constant volume?
