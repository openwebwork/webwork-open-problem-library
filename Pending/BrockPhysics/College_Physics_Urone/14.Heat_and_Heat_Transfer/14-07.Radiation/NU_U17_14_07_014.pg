Integrated Concepts: Frozen waste from airplane toilets has sometimes been accidentally ejected at high altitude. Ordinarily it breaks up and disperses over a large area, but sometimes it holds together and strikes the ground. Calculate the mass of \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) ice that can be melted by the conversion of kinetic and gravitational potential energy when a \($M\) \(\textrm{kg}\) piece of frozen waste is released at \($hkm\) \(\textrm{km}\) altitude while moving at \($vi\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) and strikes the ground at \($vf\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) (since less than \($M\) \(\textrm{kg}\) melts, a significant mess results).

BEGIN_HINT
Identify all relevant sources of energy in the question. Since energy is conserved, assuming air drag (i.e. a non-conservative force) is negligible, it must be that the excess initial energy is transformed into thermal energy that acts to melt the ice. Can you think of an expression that relates heat to a body undergoing a phase change?
