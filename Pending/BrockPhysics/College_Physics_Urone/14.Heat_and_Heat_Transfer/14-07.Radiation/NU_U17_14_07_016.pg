$PAR

Integrated Concepts: Suppose you start a workout on a Stairmaster, producing power at the same rate as climbing \(116\) stairs per minute. Assuming your mass is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and your efficiency is \($efficiency\)\(\textrm{%}\), how long will it take for your body temperature to rise \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) if all other forms of heat transfer in and out of your body are balanced?

BEGIN_HINT
You will need to research what amount of power, in watts, is generated from climbing \(116\) stairs per minute. Note that this is the power useful in driving the Stairmaster; using the given efficiency, can you determine how much power goes towards heating the body?
