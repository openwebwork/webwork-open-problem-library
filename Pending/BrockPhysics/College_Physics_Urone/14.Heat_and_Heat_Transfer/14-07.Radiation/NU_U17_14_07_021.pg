$PAR

Integrated Concepts: Hot air rises because it has expanded. It then displaces a greater volume of cold air, which increases the buoyant force on it. 

$PAR

a) Calculate the ratio of the buoyant force to the weight of \($Th ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) air surrounded by \($Tc ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) air. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Archimedes' Principle, which says that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Can you think of an expression that relates the mass and temperature of a fluid (here, air)?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Thc"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What energy is needed to cause \($V\) \(\textrm{m}^3\) of air to go from \($Tc ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($Th ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) under constant volume conditions?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
You will need to determine the appropriate specific heat capacity of air.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What gravitational potential energy is gained by this volume of air if it rises \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\)? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an expression relating the mass and density of a fluid?
