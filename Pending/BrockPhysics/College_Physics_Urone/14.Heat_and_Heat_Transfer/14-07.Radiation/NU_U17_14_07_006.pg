<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose you walk into a sauna that has an ambient temperature of \($T1C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

$PAR

a) Calculate the rate of heat transfer to you by radiation given your skin temperature is
\($T2C ^{\circ}\text{C}\), the emissivity of skin is \($e\), and the surface area of your body is \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\).


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation requires the temperatures be converted into units of Kelvin.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$P"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) If all other forms of heat transfer are balanced (the net heat transfer is zero), at
what rate will your body temperature increase if your mass is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\)?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C/min}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What is the specific heat capacity of the human body?
