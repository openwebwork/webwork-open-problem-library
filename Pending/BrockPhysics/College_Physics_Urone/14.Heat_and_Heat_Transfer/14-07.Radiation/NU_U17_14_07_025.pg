$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Unreasonable Results: A meteorite \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter is so hot immediately after
penetrating the atmosphere that it radiates \($QtkW\) \(\textrm{kW}\) of power. 

$PAR

a) What is its temperature, if the surroundings are at \($T2C^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and it has an emissivity of \($e\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{K}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation requires the temperatures be converted into units of Kelvin. Should you use the cross-sectional area or the surface area of the meteorite in your calculations?
