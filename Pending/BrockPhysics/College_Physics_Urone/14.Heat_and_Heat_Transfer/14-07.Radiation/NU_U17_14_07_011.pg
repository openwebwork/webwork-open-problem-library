A shirtless rider under a circus tent feels the heat radiating from the sunlit portion of the tent. Calculate the temperature of the tent canvas based on the following information: The shirtless rider's skin temperature is \($T1C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and has an emissivity of \($e\). The exposed area of skin is \($A \textrm{m}^2\). He receives radiation at the rate of \($Qt\) \(\textrm{W}\)â€”half what you would calculate if the entire region behind him was hot. The rest of the surroundings are at \($T1C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation. Pay attention to the wording - what should be multiplied by a factor of one-half?
