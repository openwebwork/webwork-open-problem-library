Cherry-red embers in a fireplace are at \($T1C ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) and have an exposed area of \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and an emissivity of \($e\). The surrounding room has a temperature of \($T2C  ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). If \(50\)\(\textrm{%}\) of the radiant energy enters the room, what is the net rate of radiant heat transfer in kilowatts?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation requires the temperatures be converted into units of Kelvin.
