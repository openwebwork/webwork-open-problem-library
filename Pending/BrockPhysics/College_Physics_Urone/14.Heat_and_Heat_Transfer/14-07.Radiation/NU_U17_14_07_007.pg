$PAR

Thermography is a technique for measuring radiant heat and detecting variations in surface temperatures that may be medically, environmentally, or militarily meaningful.

$PAR

a) What is the percent increase in the rate of heat transfer by radiation from a given area at a temperature of \($TC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) compared with that at \($TaC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), such as on a person's skin? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
In general, percent increase is given as the difference between the initial and final states divided by the initial state.
