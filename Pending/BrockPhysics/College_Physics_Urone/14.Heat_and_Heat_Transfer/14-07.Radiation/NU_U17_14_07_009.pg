$PAR

A large body of lava from a volcano has stopped flowing and is slowly cooling. The interior of the lava is at \($TinC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), its surface is at \($TsaC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and the surroundings are at \($TsurrC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

$PAR

a) Calculate the rate at which energy is transferred by radiation from \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) of surface lava into the surroundings, assuming the emissivity is \($e\).


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation requires the temperatures be converted into units of Kelvin.
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Suppose heat conduction to the surface occurs at the same rate. What is the thickness of the lava between the \($TsaC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) surface and the \($TinC ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) interior, assuming that the lava's conductivity is the same as that of brick?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recalling the formula for thermal conduction, can you devise and expression equating the rate at which heat is conducted from the interior of the lava to its surface with the rate at which the lava irradiates heat to its surroundings?
