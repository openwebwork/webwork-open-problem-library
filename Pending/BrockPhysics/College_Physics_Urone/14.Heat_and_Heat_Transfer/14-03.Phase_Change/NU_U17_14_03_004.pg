<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

The formation of condensation on a glass of ice water causes the ice to melt faster than it would otherwise. If \($mw\) \(\textrm{g}\) of condensation forms on a glass containing both water and \(200\) \(\textrm{g}\) of ice, how many grams of the ice will melt as a result? Assume no other heat transfer occurs.

BEGIN_HINT
What value should be used as the heat of condensation of water, given that it condenses at a relatively low temperature?
