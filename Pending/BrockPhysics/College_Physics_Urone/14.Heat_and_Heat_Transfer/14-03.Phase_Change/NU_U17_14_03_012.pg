$PAR

To help prevent frost damage, \($ma\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water is sprayed onto a fruit tree. 

$PAR

a) How much heat transfer occurs as the water freezes? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the heat transferred as an object undergoes a phase change. As always, pay attention to the units requested.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
 
b) How much would the temperature of the \($mb\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) tree decrease if this amount of heat transferred from the tree? Take the specific heat to be \(3.35 \textrm{kJ/kg}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), and assume that no phase change occurs.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat required for vaporization with that lost by the tree?
