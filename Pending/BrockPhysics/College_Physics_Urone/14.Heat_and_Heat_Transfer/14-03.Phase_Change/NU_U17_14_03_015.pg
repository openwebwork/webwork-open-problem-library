$PAR

If you pour \($mw\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of \(20.0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water onto a \($mi\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) block of ice initially at \(-15.0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), what is the final temperature? You may assume that the water cools so rapidly that effects of the surroundings are negligible.

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat gained by the ice block with that lost by the water? Be very careful with your signs - a negative sign represents heat flowing out of the system.
