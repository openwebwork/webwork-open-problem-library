<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) How much heat transfer is necessary to raise the temperature of a \($m\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) piece of ice from \(-20.0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \(130.0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), including the energy needed for phase changes? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
You will need to determine the specific heat capacity of each state of matter. Does the mass of ice change as it warms?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much time is required for the process, assuming a constant \($P\) \(\textrm{kJ/s}\) rate of heat transfer?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Use the given power and the amount of energy in \(\textrm{kJ}\) found part (a) to solve for time.
