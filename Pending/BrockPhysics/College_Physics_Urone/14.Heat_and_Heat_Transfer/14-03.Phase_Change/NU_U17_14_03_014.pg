$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A \($mice\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) ice cube at \($Tice ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is placed in \($mwater\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of \($Twater ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water in a very well-insulated container. What is the final temperature?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat gained by the ice cube with that lost by the water? Be very careful with your signs - a negative sign represents heat flowing out of the system. It may help you to use units of Kelvin for the temperatures in your calculations and convert only the final answer to Celsius.
