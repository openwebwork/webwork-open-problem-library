In some countries, liquid nitrogen is used on dairy trucks instead of mechanical refrigerators. A \(3.00\)-hour delivery trip requires \(200\) \(\textrm{L}\) of liquid nitrogen, which has a density of \($p \textrm{kg/m}^3\).

$PAR

a) Calculate the heat transfer necessary to evaporate this amount of liquid nitrogen and raise its temperature to \(3.00 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). (Use and assume it is constant over the temperature range.) This value is the amount of cooling the liquid nitrogen supplies. Assume conditions of constant pressure.

BEGIN_HINT
At what temperature is the nitrogen immediately after it finishes <i>boiling</i>?

b) What is this heat transfer rate in kilowatt-hours? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kWh}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that average power (in watts) is defined as the change in energy over the change in time (in seconds).
END_HINT

$PAR

c) Compare the amount of cooling obtained from melting an identical mass of \(0^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) ice with that from evaporating the liquid nitrogen.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the heat transferred as an object undergoes a phase change.
