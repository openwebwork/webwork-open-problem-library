$PAR

A bag containing \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) ice is much more effective in absorbing energy than one
containing the same amount of \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water. 

$PAR

a) How much heat transfer is necessary to raise the temperature of \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of water from \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

b) How much heat transfer is required to first melt \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of \(0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) ice and then raise its temperature?

BEGIN_HINT
What additional transition must ice at its melting point pass through before becoming water at the given final temperature, compared to water at the same initial temperature?
