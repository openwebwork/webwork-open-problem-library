It is difficult to extinguish a fire on a crude oil tanker, because each litre of crude oil releases \(2.80 \times 10^7\) \(\textrm{J}\) of energy when burned. To illustrate this difficulty, calculate the number of litres of water that must be expended to absorb the energy released by burning \(1.00\) \(\textrm{L}\) of crude oil, if the water has its temperature raised from \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($T2 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), it boils, and the resulting steam is raised to \($T3 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat lost by the oil to that gained by the water and, later, steam?
