$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

What would be the final temperature if \(0.260\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of \($T2\ ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water was placed in a \($T1\ ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), \($mal\) \(\textrm{kg}\) aluminum pan and \(0.0100\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of the water evaporated immediately, leaving the remainder to come to a common temperature with the pan?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat gained by the water with that lost by the pan? Be very careful with your signs - a negative sign represents heat flowing out of the system. Does the mass of water change at any time throughout this process?
