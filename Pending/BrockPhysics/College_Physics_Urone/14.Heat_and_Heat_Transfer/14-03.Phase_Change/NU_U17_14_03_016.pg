Indigenous people sometimes cook in watertight baskets by placing hot rocks into water to bring it to a boil. What mass of \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) rock must be placed in \($mrock\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of \($T2 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water to bring its temperature to \($Te ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), if \($mv\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of water escapes as vapour from the initial sizzle? You may neglect the effects of the surroundings and take the average specific heat of the rocks to be that of granite.

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat gained by the water with that lost by the rock? Be very careful with your signs - a negative sign represents heat flowing out of the system. Does the mass of water change at any time throughout this process?
