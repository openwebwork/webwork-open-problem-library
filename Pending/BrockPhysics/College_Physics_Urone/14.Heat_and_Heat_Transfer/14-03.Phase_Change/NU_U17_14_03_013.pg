<b>If you do not answer this probelm correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A \($mal\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) aluminum bowl holding \($ms\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of soup at \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) is placed in a freezer. What is the final temperature if \(377\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of energy is transferred from the bowl and soup, assuming the soup's thermal properties are the same as that of water?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Do this problem sequentially - How much heat is required to bring the soup-bowl system to the normal freezing point? To freeze the soup? Is there any heat still to be transferred out once the soup is fully frozen?
