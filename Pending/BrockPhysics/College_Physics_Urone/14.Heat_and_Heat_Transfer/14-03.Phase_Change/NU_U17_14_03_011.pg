$PAR

The energy released from condensation in thunderstorms can be very large. Calculate the energy released into the atmosphere for a small storm of radius \(1\) \(\textrm{km}\), assuming that \(1.0\) \(\textrm{cm}\) of rain is precipitated uniformly over this area.

BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for the mass of water given its density (what is it?) and volume? It may help you to visualize the thunderstorm as a cylinder. What value of the heat of vaporization of water should you use, given that a thunderstorm would occur in temperatures closer to body temperature than to the normal boiling point?
