$PAR

Some gun fanciers make their own bullets, which involves melting and casting the lead slugs. How much heat transfer is needed to raise the temperature and melt \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of lead, starting from \(25.0 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
At what temperature is the lead immediately after it finishes <i>melting</i>?
