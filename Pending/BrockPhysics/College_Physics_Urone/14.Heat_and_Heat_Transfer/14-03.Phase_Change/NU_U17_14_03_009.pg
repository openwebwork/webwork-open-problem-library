$PAR

How many grams of coffee must evaporate from \($mc\) \(\textrm{g}\) of coffee in a \($mg\)-\(\textrm{g}\) glass cup to cool the coffee from \($T2 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)? You may assume the coffee has the same thermal properties as water and that the average heat of vaporization is \($Lv\) \(\textrm{kJ/kg}\). (You may neglect the change in mass of the coffee as it cools, which will give you an answer that is slightly larger than correct.)

$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an expression equating the heat lost by the coffee-cup system with that carried away by evaporation?
