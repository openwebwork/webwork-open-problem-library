In 1986, a gargantuan iceberg broke away from the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. It was approximately a rectangle \($lkm\) \(\textrm{km}\) long, \($wkm\) \(\textrm{km}\) wide, and \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\) thick. (a) What is the mass of this iceberg, given that the density of ice is \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{kg}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for mass given density and volume?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$m"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

(b) How much heat transfer (in joules) is needed to melt it?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} J

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the heat transferred as an object undergoes a phase change.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) How many years would it take sunlight alone to melt ice this thick, if the ice absorbs an average of \(100 \textrm{W/m}^2\), \($hour\)  \(\textrm{h}\) per day?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{years}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Pay careful attention to the units - you were told the amount of sunlight absorbed in terms of <i>intensity</i> - power per unit area. From which surface do you suppose the iceberg absorbs sunlight?
