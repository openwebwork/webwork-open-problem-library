$PAR

Suppose identical amounts of heat transfer into different masses of copper and water, causing identical changes in temperature. What is the ratio of the mass of copper to water?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Can you express the temperature change as independant functions of the masses of copper and water? If so, you can equate and rearrange these equations.
