$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A \($m\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) block of a pure material is heated from \($T1 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($T2 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) by the addition of \($QkJ\) \(\textrm{kJ}\) of energy. Calculate its specific heat and identify the substance of which it is most likely composed.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal/kg}\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)

$PAR

The material having this specific heat capacity is \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Pay attention to the units - you need need to convert \(\textrm{kJ}\) to \(\textrm{kcal}\). Cross-reference your calculated specific heat capacity to those tabulated in an external reference to identify the material.
