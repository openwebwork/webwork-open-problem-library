$PAR

Rubbing your hands together warms them by converting work into thermal energy. If a woman rubs her hands back and forth for a total of \($N\) rubs, at a distance of \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) per rub, and with an average frictional force of \($F\) \(\textrm{N}\), what is the temperature increase? The mass of tissues warmed is only \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\), mostly in the palms and fingers.

BEGIN_HINT
Given that heat is a form of energy, can you devise an expression equating the work done by friction with the thermal energy generated by rubbing you hands? What is the specific heat capacity of the human body?
