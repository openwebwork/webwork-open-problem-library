$PAR

The number of kilocalories in food is determined by calorimetry techniques in which the food is burned and the amount of heat transfer is measured. How many kilocalories per gram are there in a \($mp\) \(\textrm{g}\) peanut if the energy from burning it is transferred to \($mw\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of water held in a \($mal\) \(\textrm{kg}\) aluminum cup, causing a \($T ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) temperature increase?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal/g}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Does the heat emitted go only to warming the water? Furthermore, pay careful attention to the units requested - kilocalories per gram (of peanut).
