Even when shut down after a period of normal use, a large commercial nuclear reactor transfers thermal energy at the rate of \(150\) \(\textrm{MW}\) by the radioactive decay of fission products. This heat transfer causes a rapid increase in temperature if the cooling system fails.

$PAR

a) Calculate the rate of temperature increase in degrees Celsius per second (\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)\(\textrm{/s}\)) if the mass of the reactor core is \(1.60 \times 10^5\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and it has an average specific heat of \(0.3349\) \(\textrm{kJ/kg} ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\).

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How long would it take to obtain a temperature increase of \($increase ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), which could cause some metals holding the radioactive materials to melt?
(The initial rate of temperature increase would be greater than that calculated here
because the heat transfer is concentrated in a smaller mass. Later, however, the
temperature increase would slow down because the \(5.00 \times 10^5\) \(\textrm{kg}\) steel containment vessel would also begin to heat up.)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that average power is defined as the change in energy over the change in time.
