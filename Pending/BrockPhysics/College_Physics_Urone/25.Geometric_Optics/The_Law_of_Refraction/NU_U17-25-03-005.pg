There was a major collision of an asteroid with the Moon in medieval times. It was described by monks at Canterbury Cathedral in England as a red glow on and around the Moon. How long after the asteroid hit the Moon, which is \($moon_distance \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{km}\)  away, would the light first arrive on Earth?
