A magnifying glass was found to have a focal length of \($focal_length\) \(\textrm{cm}\).

a) Find the magnification for the book when it is held \($object_distance_a\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from the magnifier.

BEGIN_HINT
For both parts (a) and (b), can you first rearrange the thin lens equation to solve for the unknown image distance? How then could you substitute this result into one of the formul&#230; for magnification?
