A camera with a \($focal_length\) \(\textrm{mm}\) focal length lens is used to photograph the sun and moon. What is the height of the image of the sun on the film, given the sun is \($object_height \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{km}\) in diameter and is \($object_distance \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{km}\) away?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you first rearrange the thin lens equation to solve for the unknown image distance? How then could you substitute this result into one of the formul&#230; for magnification?
