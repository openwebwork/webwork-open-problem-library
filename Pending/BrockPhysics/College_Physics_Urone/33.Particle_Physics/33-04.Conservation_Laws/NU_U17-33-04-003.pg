$PAR
The mass of a theoretical particle that may be associated with the unification of the
electroweak and strong forces is \(10^{14}\) \(\textrm{GeV/c}^2\). 
$PAR
a) How many proton masses is this?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$ratioa"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How many electron masses is this? (This indicates how extremely relativistic the
accelerator would have to be in order to make the particle, and how large the
relativistic quantity \(\gamma\) would have to be.)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$ratiob"));

BEGIN_HINT
First, find proton and electron mass in \(\textrm{GeV/c}^2\).
