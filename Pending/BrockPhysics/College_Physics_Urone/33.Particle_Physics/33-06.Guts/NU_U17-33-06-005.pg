$PAR

The primary decay mode for the negative pion is \(\pi^-\) &#8594; \(\mu^-\)+\(v_{\mu}\).
$PAR
a) What is the energy release in \(\textrm{MeV}\) in this decay? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{MeV}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Energy"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Using conservation of momentum, how much energy does each of the decay products receive, given the \(\pi^-\) is at rest when it decays? You may assume the muon antineutrino is massless and has momentum \(p\) = \(E/c\), just like a photon.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{MeV}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Energyu"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the laws of conservation of momentum as well as the conservation of energy.
