$MeV = random(150,300,1);

$PAR
The intensity of cosmic ray radiation decreases rapidly with increasing energy, but there are occasionally extremely energetic cosmic rays that create a shower of radiation from all the particles they create by striking a nucleus in the atmosphere as seen in the figure given below. Suppose a cosmic ray particle having an energy of \(10^{10} \, \(\textrm{GeV}\) converts its energy into particles with masses averaging \($MeV\) \(\textrm{GeV/c}^2\). 
$PAR
a) How many particles are created? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

ANS(num_cmp("$particles"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If the particles rain down on a \($Area\) \(\textrm{km}^2\) area, how many particles are there per square meter?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{particles/m}^2\)
