$PAR

Plans for an accelerator that produces a secondary beam of K-mesons to scatter from nuclei, for the purpose of studying the strong force, call for them to have a kinetic energy of \($KE \, \(\textrm{MeV}\). 
$PAR
a) What would the relativistic quantity be for these particles? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$gamma"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How long would their average lifetime be in the laboratory? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$time"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) How far could they travel in this time?
$PAR

You may need to recall some definitions from earlier chapters (i.e. kinematics, energy)
