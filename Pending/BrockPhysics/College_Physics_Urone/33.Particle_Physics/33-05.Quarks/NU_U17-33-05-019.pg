$PAR
There are particles called D-mesons. One of them is the D<sup>+</sup> meson, which has a single positive charge and a baryon number of zero, also the value of its strangeness, topness, and bottomness. It has a charm of \(+1\). What is its quark configuration?
$PAR
Charm = \(c\); anticharm = \(C\); down = \(d\); antidown = \(D\); 
$PAR

\(\textrm{D}^+\) = \{ans_rule(10)\}

END_TEXT

ANS(fun_cmp("cD", var=>["c","D"]));

BEGIN_HINT
If strangeness, topness, and bottomness are eliminated, what options do you have left? Which option do you think is more appropriate? Why?
