$PAR
Because of energy loss due to synchrotron radiation in the LHC at CERN, only \($MeV \, \(\textrm{MeV}\) is added to the energy of each proton during each revolution around the main
ring. How many revolutions are needed to produce \($TeV \, \(\textrm{TeV}\) (\($TeV1 \, \(\textrm{GeV}\) protons, if they are injected with an initial energy of \($GeV \, \(\textrm{GeV}\)?
