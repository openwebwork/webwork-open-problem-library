$PAR

At full energy, protons in the \($diameter \, \(\textrm{km}\) diameter Fermilab synchrotron travel at nearly
the speed of light, since their energy is about \(1000\) times their rest mass energy. 
$PAR
a) How long does it take for a proton to complete one trip around? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$time"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How many times per second will it pass through the target area?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$frequency"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of speed. 
$PAR
What is the relationship between period and frequency?
