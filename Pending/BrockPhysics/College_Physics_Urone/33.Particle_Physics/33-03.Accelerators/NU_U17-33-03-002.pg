$PAR

Suppose a \(W^-\) created in a bubble chamber lives for \($t \times 10^{-25} \, \(\textrm{s}\). What distance does it move in this time if it is traveling at \($velocity \, \(\textrm{c}\)? Since this distance is too short to make a track, the presence of the \(W^-\) must be inferred from its decay products. 
$PAR
Note that the time is longer than the given \(W^-\) lifetime, which can be due to the statistical nature of decay or time dilation.
