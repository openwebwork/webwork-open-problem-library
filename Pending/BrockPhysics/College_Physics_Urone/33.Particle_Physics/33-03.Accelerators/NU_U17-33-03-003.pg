$PAR
What length track does a \(\pi^+\) traveling at \($velocity \, \(\textrm{c}\) leave in a bubble chamber if it is created there and lives for \($t \times 10^{-8} \, \(\textrm{s}\)? (Those moving faster or living longer may escape the detector before decaying.)

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$distance"));

BEGIN_HINT
It may be useful to recall kinematics equations when solving this problem.
