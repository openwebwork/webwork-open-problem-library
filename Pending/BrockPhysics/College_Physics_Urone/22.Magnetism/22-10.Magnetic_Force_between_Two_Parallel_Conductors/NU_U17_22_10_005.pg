$PAR
An AC appliance cord has its hot and neutral wires separated by \($distance \, \(\textrm{mm}\) and carries a \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) current.
$PAR

a) What is the average force per metre between the wires in the cord?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the maximum force per metre between the wires?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
The average force per metre is attributed to two wires.
