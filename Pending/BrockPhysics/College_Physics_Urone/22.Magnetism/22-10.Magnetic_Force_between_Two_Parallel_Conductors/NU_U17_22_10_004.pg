<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
The wire carrying \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) to the motor of a commuter train feels an attractive force of \($force\) \(\times 10^{-3} \, \(\textrm{N/m}\) due to a parallel wire carrying \($current_parallel \, \(\textrm{A}\) to a headlight. How far apart are the wires?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
You do not need length in this question, as you are given a value of force per unit distance.
