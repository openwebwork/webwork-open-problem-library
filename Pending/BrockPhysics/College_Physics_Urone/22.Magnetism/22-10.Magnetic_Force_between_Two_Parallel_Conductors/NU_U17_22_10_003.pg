<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A \($length \, \(\textrm{m}\) segment of wire supplying current to the motor of a submerged submarine carries \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) and feels a \($force \, \(\textrm{N}\) repulsive force from a parallel wire \($distance \, \(\textrm{cm}\) away. What is the magnitude of the current in the other wire?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{A}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Current is not squared in this situation, as there are two values rather than one.
END_HINT
