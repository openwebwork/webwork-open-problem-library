$PAR
Aircraft sometimes acquire small static charges. Suppose a supersonic jet has a \($charge\) Î¼\(\textrm{C}\) charge and flies due west at a speed of \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) over the Earth's south magnetic pole, where the \($T\) \(\times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{T}\) magnetic field points straight up. What is the magnitude of the magnetic force on the plane?

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the magnitude of \(\textrm{sin(x)}\) in this situation.
