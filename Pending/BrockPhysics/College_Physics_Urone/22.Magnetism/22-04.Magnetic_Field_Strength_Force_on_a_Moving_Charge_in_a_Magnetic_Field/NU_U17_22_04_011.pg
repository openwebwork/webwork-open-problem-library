$PAR
A physicist performing a sensitive measurement wants to limit the magnetic force on a moving charge in her equipment to less than \($force\) \(\times 10^{-12} \, \(\textrm{N}\). What is the greatest the charge can be if it moves at a maximum speed of \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in the Earth's field?
