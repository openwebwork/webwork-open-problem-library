<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What would the Hall voltage be if a \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) field is applied across a 10-gauge copper wire (\($diameter \, \(\textrm{mm}\) in diameter) carrying a \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) current? The number density of charge for copper is \(8.34 \times 10^{28}\) \(\textrm{e/m}^3\)
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\mu \textrm{V}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
You will have to combine more than one formula as there are multiple unknowns.
