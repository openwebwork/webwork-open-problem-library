$PAR
What is the speed of a supersonic aircraft with a \($wingspan \, \(\textrm{m}\) wingspan, if it experiences a \($voltage \, \(\textrm{V}\) Hall voltage between its wing tips when in level flight over the north magnetic pole, where the Earth's field strength is \($strength\) \(\times 10^-5 \, \(\textrm{T}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
You must rearrange the formula to find speed.
