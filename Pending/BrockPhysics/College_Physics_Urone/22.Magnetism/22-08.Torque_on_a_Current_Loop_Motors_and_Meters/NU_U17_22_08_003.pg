<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Find the current through a loop needed to create a maximum torque of \($torque \, \(\textrm{Nm}\). The loop has \($turns\) square turns that are \($length \, \(\textrm{cm}\) on a side and is in a uniform \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) magnetic field.

BEGIN_HINT
You will have to rearrange the formula to find the answer.
