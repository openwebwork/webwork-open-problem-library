<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) A \($turns\)-turn circular loop of radius \($radius \, \(\textrm{cm}\) is vertical, with its axis on an east-west line. A current of \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) circulates clockwise in the loop when viewed from the east. The Earth's field here is due north, parallel to the ground, with a strength of \($strength\) \(\times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{T}\). What is the magnitude of the torque on the loop?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Nm}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
When calculating area recall that the current loop is circular.
