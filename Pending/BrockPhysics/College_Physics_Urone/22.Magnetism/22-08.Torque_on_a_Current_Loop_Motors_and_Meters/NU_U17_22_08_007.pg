$PAR
A proton has a magnetic field due to its spin on its axis. The field is similar to that created by a circular current loop \($radius\) \(\times 10^{-15} \, \(\textrm{m}\) in radius with a current of \($current\) \(\times 10^{4} \, \(\textrm{A}\). Find the maximum torque on a proton in a \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) field.
$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the current loop is circular when calculating the area.
