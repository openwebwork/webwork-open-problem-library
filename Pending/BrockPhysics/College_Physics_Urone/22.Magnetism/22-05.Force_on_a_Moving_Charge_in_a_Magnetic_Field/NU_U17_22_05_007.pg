$PAR
An electron in a TV CRT moves with a speed of \($speed\) \(\times 10^{7} \, \(\textrm{m/s}\), in a direction perpendicular to the Earth's field, which has a strength of \($strength\) \(\times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{T}\).
$PAR

a) What strength electric field must be applied perpendicular to the Earth's field to make the electron moves in a straight line?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kV/m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If this is done between plates separated by \($D \, \(\textrm{cm}\), what is the voltage applied? (Note that TVs are usually surrounded by a ferromagnetic material to shield against external magnetic fields and avoid the need for such a correction.)
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to make proper unit conversions.
