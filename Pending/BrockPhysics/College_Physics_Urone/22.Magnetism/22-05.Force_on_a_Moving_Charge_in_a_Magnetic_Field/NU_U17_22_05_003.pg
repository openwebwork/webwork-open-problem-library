$PAR
Viewers of Star Trek hear of an antimatter drive on the Starship Enterprise. One possibility for such a futuristic energy source is to store antimatter charged particles in a vacuum chamber, circulating in a magnetic field, and then extract them as needed. Antimatter annihilates with normal matter, producing pure energy. What strength magnetic field is needed to hold antiprotons, moving at \($speed\) \(\times 10^{7} \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in a circular path \($radius \, \(\textrm{m}\) in radius? Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but the opposite (negative) charge.

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the mass and charge of a proton, since those values have the same magnitude for antiprotons.
