$PAR
Triply charged uranium-235 and uranium-238 ions are being separated in a mass spectrometer. (The much rarer uranium-235 is used as reactor fuel.) The masses of the ions are \(3.90 \times 10^{-25} \, \(\textrm{kg}\) and \(3.95 \times 10^{-25} \, \(\textrm{kg}\), respectively, and they travel at \(3.00 \times 10^{5} \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in a \(0.250 \, \(\textrm{T}\) field.
$PAR

What is the separation between their paths when they hit a target after traversing a semicircle?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the ions are <i>triply</i> charge.
