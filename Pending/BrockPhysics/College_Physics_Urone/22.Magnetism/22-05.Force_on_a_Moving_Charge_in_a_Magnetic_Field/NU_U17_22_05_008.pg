$PAR
a) At what speed will a proton move in a circular path of \($D \, \(\textrm{m}\) where the field strength is \($strength\)\(\times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{T}\)? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What would the radius of the path be if the proton had a speed of \($speed\) \(\times 10^{6} \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
You will have to rearrange the formula to be able to find speed.
