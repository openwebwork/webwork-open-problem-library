<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) Calculate the maximum torque on a \($turns\) turn, \($radius \, \(\textrm{cm}\) radius circular current loop carrying \($current\) μ\(\textrm{A}\) in a \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) field.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Nm}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If this coil is to be used in a galvanometer that reads \($scale\) μ\(\textrm{A}\) full scale, what force constant spring must be used, if it is attached \($distance \, \(\textrm{cm}\) from the axis of rotation and is stretched by the \(60^{\circ}\) arc moved?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that torque is force through a displacement. How would you define the force in this situation?
