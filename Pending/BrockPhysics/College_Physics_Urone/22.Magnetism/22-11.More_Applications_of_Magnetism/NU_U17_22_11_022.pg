$E = 17.0*10**-4;

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A current balance used to define the ampere is designed so that the current through it is constant, as is the distance between wires. Even so, if the wires change length with temperature, the force between them will change. What percent change in force per degree will occur if the wires are copper?

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that for copper, \(\alpha\) = \(17.0 \times 10^{-6}\).
