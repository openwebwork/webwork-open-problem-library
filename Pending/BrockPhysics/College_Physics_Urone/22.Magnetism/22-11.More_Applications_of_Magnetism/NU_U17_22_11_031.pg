<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Frustrated by the small Hall voltage obtained in blood flow measurements, a medical physicist decides to increase the applied magnetic field strength to get a \($voltage \, \(\textrm{V}\) output for blood moving at \($speed \, \(\textrm{cm/s}\) in a \($diameter \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter vessel.
$PAR
What magnetic field strength is needed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{T}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Rearrange the appropriate formula to solve. 
$PAR
Is this result reasonable?
END_HINT
