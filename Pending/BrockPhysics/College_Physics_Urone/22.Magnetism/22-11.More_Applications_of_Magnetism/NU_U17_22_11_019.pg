$PAR
To construct a nonmechanical water meter, a \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) magnetic field is placed across the supply water pipe to a home and the Hall voltage is recorded.
$PAR
a) Find the flow rate in liters per second through a \($diameter \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter pipe if the Hall voltage is \($voltage \, \(\textrm{mV}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^3\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What would the Hall voltage be for the same flow rate through a \($diameter_b \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter pipe with the same field applied?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the volume flow rate and potential formulas in relation to speed.
