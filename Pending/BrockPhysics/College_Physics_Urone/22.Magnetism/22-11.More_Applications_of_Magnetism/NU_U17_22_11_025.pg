$PAR
A \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) baseball, pitched at \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) horizontally and perpendicular to the Earth's horizontal \($strength\) \(\times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{T}\) field, has a \($charge \, \(\textrm{nC}\) charge on it. What distance is it deflected from its path by the magnetic force, after traveling \($distance \, \(\textrm{m}\) horizontally?

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
For a larger radius, arc length is approximately equal to horizontal distance, where \(\theta\) is approximately equal to the horizontal distance over arc length multiplied by \(360^{\circ}\)
