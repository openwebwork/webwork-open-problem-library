<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) What is the angle between a wire carrying an \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) current and the \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) field it is in if \($length \, \(\textrm{cm}\) of the wire experiences a magnetic force of \($force \, \(\textrm{N}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the force on the wire if it is rotated to make an angle of \(90^{\circ}\) with the field?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

For part (a), remember to convert answer into degrees.
