<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What force is exerted on the water in an MHD drive utilizing a \($diameter \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter tube, if \($current \, \(\textrm{A}\) current is passed across the tube that is perpendicular to a \($strength \, \(\textrm{T}\) magnetic field? (The relatively small size of this force indicates the need for very large currents and magnetic fields to make practical MHD drives.)
