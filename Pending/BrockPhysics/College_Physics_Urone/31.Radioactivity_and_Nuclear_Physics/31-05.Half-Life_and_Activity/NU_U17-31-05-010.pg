You can sometimes find deep red crystal vases in antique stores, called uranium glass because their colour was produced by doping the glass with uranium. Calculate the activity of such a vase assuming it has \($massU \, \textrm{g}\) of uranium in it. Neglect the activity of any daughter nuclides.

BEGIN_HINT
For each isotope of uranium, can you, recalling Avagadro's number, first rearrange the definition of molar mass to solve for the number of radioactive nuclei? (You will need their percent abundances.) What then is the activity of each isotope? Of the vase, in total?
