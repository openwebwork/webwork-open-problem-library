The Galileo space probe was launched on its long journey past several planets in 1989, 
with an ultimate goal of Jupiter. Its power source is \($mass \, \textrm{kg}\) of\(\:^{2 3 8}\textrm{Pu}\), a by-product of nuclear weapons plutonium production. Electrical energy is generated thermoelectrically from the heat produced when the \($MeV \, \textrm{MeV} \, \alpha\) particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of\(\:^{2 3 8}\textrm{Pu}\) is\(\:$thalf\) years.
