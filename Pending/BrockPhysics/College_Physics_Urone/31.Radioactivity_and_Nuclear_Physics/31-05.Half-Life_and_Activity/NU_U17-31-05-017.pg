The \(\,^{210}\textrm{Po}\) source used in a physics laboratory is labeled as having an activity of \($activity_1uCi\) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;Ci</span> on the date it was prepared. A student measures the radioactivity of this source with a Geiger counter and observes \($activity_observed\) counts per minute. She notices that the source was prepared \($time\) days before her lab. What fraction of the decays is she observing with her apparatus?
