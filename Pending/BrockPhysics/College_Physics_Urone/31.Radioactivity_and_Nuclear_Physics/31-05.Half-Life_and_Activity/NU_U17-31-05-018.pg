Armour-piercing shells with depleted uranium cores are fired by aircraft at tanks. (The high density of the uranium makes them effective.) The uranium is called depleted because it has had its \(\,^{235}\textrm{U}\) removed for reactor use and is nearly pure \(\,^{238}\textrm{U}\). Depleted uranium has been erroneously called non-radioactive. To demonstrate that this is wrong: 

$PAR

a) Calculate the activity of \($massU \, \textrm{g}\) of pure \(\,^{238}\textrm{U}\).

Can you first rearrange the definition of molar mass to solve for the number of radioactive nuclei?

BEGIN_HINT
How many of the total radioactive nuclei in the natural uranium are uranium-238? Uranium-235? (You will need their percent abundances.) What then is the activity of each isotope? Of the depleted uranium, in total?
