BEGIN_TEXT
The Galileo space probe was launched on its long journey past several planets in 1989, 
with an ultimate goal of Jupiter. Its power source is \($mass\) kg of \(^{238}\)Pu, a by-product of nuclear weapons plutonium production. Electrical energy is generated thermoelectrically from the heat produced when the \($MeV\)-MeV \(\alpha\) particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of \(^{238}\)Pu is \($thalf\) years. 
$BR
a) What was the original activity of the \(^{238}\)Pu in becquerel?
