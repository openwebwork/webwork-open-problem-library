BEGIN_HINT
For both parts a) and b), begin by assuming that, at present, you have a one-million-particle system. How many of these particles are made up of uranium-235? Of uranium-238? (You will need their percent abundances.) Can you then, for each isotope, rearrange the formula for exponential decay to solve for the number of radioactive nuclei existing at the dawn of the first day?
