Suppose a particle of ionizing radiation deposits \($energy_MeV \, \textrm{MeV}\) in the gas of a Geiger tube, all of which goes to creating ion pairs. Each ion pair requires \($energy_per_pair \, \textrm{eV}\) of energy.

a) The applied voltage sweeps the ions out of the gas in \($time\) Î¼s. What is the current?

BEGIN_HINT
Perhaps using dimensional analysis, can you first express the average current in terms of:
$PAR
<b>i.</b> the charge on the ions created, and
$PAR
<b>ii.</b> the number of ions created each second?
$PAR
Furthermore, remember that, in calculating <b>ii.</b>, you are told what energy is consumed by an ion <i>pair</i>.

b) This current is smaller than the actual current since the applied voltage in the Geiger tube accelerates the separated ions, which then create other ion pairs in subsequent collisions. What is the current if this last effect multiplies the number of ion pairs by\(\,$m\)?
