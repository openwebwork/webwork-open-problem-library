The detail observable using a probe is limited by its wavelength. Calculate the energy of a \(\gamma\)-ray photon that has a wavelength of \($wavelength \times 10^{-16} \, \textrm{m}\), small enough to detect details about one-tenth the size of a nucleon.

Note that a photon having this energy is difficult to produce and interacts poorly with the nucleus, limiting the practicability of this probe.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the energy of a photon and the relationship between frequency and wavelength.
