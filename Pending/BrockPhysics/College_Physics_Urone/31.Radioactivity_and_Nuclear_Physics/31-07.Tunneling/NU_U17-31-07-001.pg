Devise an equation giving half-life as a function of the energy released in \(\alpha\) decay using the data in the table above. It may be useful to graph the log of half-life against  energy to find some straight-line relationship.

Slope: \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{MeV}^{-1}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Use Excel or some other spreadsheet application to regress half-life on energy. If such a technique is unfamiliar to you, however, try plotting, <i>accurately</i>, by hand, on graph paper, the linearized relationship and calculating the slope of the trendline by first measuring, relative to the origin, its abscissa and ordinate intercepts with a ruler.
