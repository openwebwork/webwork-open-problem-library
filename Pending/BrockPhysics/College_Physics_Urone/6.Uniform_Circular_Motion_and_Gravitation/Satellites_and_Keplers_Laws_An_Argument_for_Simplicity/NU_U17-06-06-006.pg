$PAR
Space debris left from old satellites and their launchers is becoming a hazard to other satellites.
$PAR

a) Calculate the speed of a satellite in an orbit \($hkm\,\textrm{km}\) above Earth's surface.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Suppose a loose rivet is in an orbit of the same radius that intersects the satellite's orbit at an angle of \(90^\circ\) relative to Earth. What is the velocity of the rivet relative to the satellite just before striking it?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) Given the rivet is \($dmm\,\textrm{mm}\) in size, how long will its collision with the satellite last?

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_TEXT
d) If its mass is \($mg\,\textrm{g}\), what is the average force it exerts on the satellite?
$PAR

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A4"));

BEGIN_TEXT
e) How much energy in joules is generated by the collision? (The satellite's velocity does not change appreciably, because its mass is much greater than the rivet's.)
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A5"));


BEGIN_HINT
Notice that your answers for (a) and (b) should be in units of m/s. Does this mean you need to calculate the angular velocity or tangential velocity?
$PAR
Consider the fundamental kinematics equations.
