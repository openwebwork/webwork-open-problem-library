BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Astronomical observations of or Milky Way galaxy indicate that it has a mass of about \($mmw\times 10^{11}\) solar masses. A star orbiting the galaxy's periphery is about \($ds \times 10^{4}\) light years from its center.
$PAR

a) What should the orbital period of the star be?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{8}\, \textrm{years}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If its period is \($Ts\times 10^{7}\) instead, what is the mass of the galaxy?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{13}\, \textrm{solar masses}\)

$PAR
Such calculations are used to imply the existence of "dark matter" in the universe and have indicated, for example, the existence of very massive black holes at the centers of some galaxies.
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the gravitational and orbital equations.
$PAR
Remember that these equations do not work in units of solar masses and light years.
