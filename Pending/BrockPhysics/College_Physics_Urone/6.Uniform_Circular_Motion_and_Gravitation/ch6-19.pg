A car of mass \(1200\) kg moves around a circular curve of radius \(300\) m at a constant speed of \(28\) m/s. The curved road is on level ground. $BR
  
$PAR
(a) Determine the magnitude of the car's acceleration. $BR

(b) Determine the magnitude of the frictional force that the road must exert on the car to keep it turning in its circular path.  $BR

$PAR
(c) Because the car does not slide sideways as it moves, it is static friction that provides the force that keeps the car moving in a circular path. Determine the minimum coefficient of static friction between the road and the car.  $BR
