<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A mother pushes her child on a swing so that his speed is \($velocitySI\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) at the lowest point of his path. The swing is suspended \($radiusSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) above the child's center of mass.

a) What is the centripetal acceleration of the child at the low point?

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin by drawing the free-body diagram of the child. Is the child accelerating, with respect to an inertial frame of reference? It may further help you to recall Newton's third law.
