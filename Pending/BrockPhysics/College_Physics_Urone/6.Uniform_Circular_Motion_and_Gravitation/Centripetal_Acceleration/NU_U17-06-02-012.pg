<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Riders in an amusement park ride shaped like a Viking ship hung from a large pivot are rotated back and forth like a rigid pendulum. Sometime near the middle of the ride, the ship is momentarily motionless at the top of its circular arc. The ship then swings down under the influence of gravity.

a) Assuming negligible friction, find the speed of the riders at the bottom of its arc, given the system's center of mass travels in an arc having a radius of \($radiusSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) and the riders are near the center of mass.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of energy. How high above the ground is the ride at the top of its arc, when it is horizontal, in terms of the given radius?

BEGIN_HINT
Begin by drawing the free-body diagram of an individual rider. Are they accelerating, with respect to an inertial frame of reference? It may further help you to recall Newton's third law.
