A rotating space station is said to create “artificial gravity”—a loosely-defined term used for an acceleration that would be crudely similar to gravity. The outer wall of the rotating space station would become a floor for the astronauts, and centripetal acceleration supplied by the floor would allow astronauts to exercise and maintain muscle and bone strength more naturally than in non-rotating space environments. If the space station is \($diameterSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) in diameter, what angular velocity would produce an “artificial gravity” of  \($g\) \(\textrm{m/s}^2\) at the rim?
