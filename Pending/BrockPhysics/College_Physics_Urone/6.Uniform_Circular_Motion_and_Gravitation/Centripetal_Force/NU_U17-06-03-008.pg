<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> If a car takes a banked curve at less than the ideal speed, friction is needed to keep it from sliding toward the inside of the curve (a real problem on icy mountain roads).

a) Calculate the ideal speed to take a \($radiusSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) radius curve banked at \($theta_degrees^{\circ}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Begin by drawing the free-body diagram of a car negotiating the banked curve. Which force (or component thereof) is responsible for the centripetal acceleration?

BEGIN_HINT
Revise your free-body diagram to include the frictional force. In which direction (<i>i.e.</i> up or down the incline) does it act? Be careful - assuming you have not tilted your coordinate system, friction will contribute to the net force in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
