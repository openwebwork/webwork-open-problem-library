$PAR

A typical car has an axle with \($li\) \(\textrm{cm}\) radius driving a tire with a radius of \($lo\) \(\textrm{cm}\). What is its mechanical advantage assuming the very simplified model in the figure above?

BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium and recall the definition of mechanical advantage. Can you express the output and input forces as a ratio of their respective distances away from the pivot?
