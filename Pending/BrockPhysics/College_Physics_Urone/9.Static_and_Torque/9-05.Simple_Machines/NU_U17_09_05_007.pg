<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

If you used an ideal pulley of the type shown in the figure above having a mass of \($mps\) \(\textrm{kg}\) to support a car engine of mass \(115\) \(\textrm{kg}\),

$PAR

a) What is the tension in the rope?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the mechanical advantage in a pulley system is approximately the number of upward-acting tension forces.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$T"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What force must the ceiling supply, assuming you pull straight up on the rope? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium. For what deficiency in upward force must the force exerted by the ceiling compensate?
END_HINT
