$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

What is the mechanical advantage of a nail puller—similar to the one shown in the figure above—where you exert a force \($d\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from the pivot and the nail is \($d2\) \(\textrm{cm}\) on the other side?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium and recall the definition of mechanical advantage. Can you express the output and input forces as a ratio of their respective distances away from the pivot?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$MA"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

What minimum force must you exert to apply a force of \($Fb\) \(\textrm{N}\) to the nail?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for the input force using your answer from (a) above?
