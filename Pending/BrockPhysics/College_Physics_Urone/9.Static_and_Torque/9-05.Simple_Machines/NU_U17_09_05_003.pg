$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the mechanical advantage of a wheelbarrow, such as the one in the figure above, if the centre of gravity of the wheelbarrow and its load has a perpendicular lever arm of \($lo\) \(\textrm{cm}\), while the hands have a perpendicular lever arm of \($li\) \(\textrm{m}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium and recall the definition of mechanical advantage. Can you express the output and input forces as a ratio of their respective distances away from the pivot?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$MA"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What upward force should you exert to support the wheelbarrow and its load if their combined mass is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for the input force using your answer from (a) above?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fi"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What force does the wheel exert on the ground?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrn{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium. For what deficiency in upward force must the normal force compensate?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$N"));
