<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose you needed to raise a \($m\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) mower a distance of \(6.00\) \(\textrm{cm}\) above the ground to change a tire. If you had a \($r\)-\(\textrm{m}\) long lever, where would you place the fulcrum if your force was limited to \($F\) \(\textrm{N}\) and the mower was situated on the right end of the lever?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\) from the right end of the lever

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium. Is the height to which the mower would need to be raised relevant?
