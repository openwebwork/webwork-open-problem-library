$PAR

Two children of mass \($m1\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and \($m2\) \(\textrm{kg}\) sit balanced on a seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw. If the children are separated by a distance of \($r\) \(\textrm{m}\), at what distance from the pivot point is the small child sitting in order to maintain the balance?

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces. Must not the distances of the two children from the pivot sum to the total distance by which they are separated? Can you express this mathematically?
