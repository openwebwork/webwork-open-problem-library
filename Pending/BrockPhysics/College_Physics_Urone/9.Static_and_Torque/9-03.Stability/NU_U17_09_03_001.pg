$PAR

Suppose a horse leans against a wall as in the figure above. Calculate the force exerted on
the wall assuming that force is horizontal. Note that the force exerted on the wall is equal and
opposite to the force exerted on the horse, keeping it in equilibrium. The total mass of
the horse and rider is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Given that the horse is motionless in the vertical direction, to what must the upwardly-directed normal force be equal?
