$PAR

a) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force on each foot of the horse in
the above figure (two are on the ground), assuming the centre of mass of the horse is
midway between the feet. The total mass of the horse and rider is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) acting at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the vertical (wall)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given that the centre of mass is midway between its feet, what fraction of the horse's weight will each hoof support? What then can be said about the normal force on each foot, and in turn, about the force of static friction? You will need to use the second condition for static equilibrium to first work out the force exerted by the wall.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));
ANS(num_cmp("$degrees"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the minimum coefficient of friction between the hooves and ground? Note that the force exerted by the wall is horizontal.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for static friction at its maximum. For the horse not to move laterally, all horizontal forces must balance.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$us"));
