$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What minimum coefficient of friction is needed between the legs and the ground to keep the sign in the figure above in the position shown if the chain breaks, given that the sign has a mass of \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Isolate one board of the sign and begin with the second condition for static equilibrium. Given that the total mass of the sign is \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\), what then is the mass of one board? The normal force exerted on one board? Recall further the formula for static friction at its maximum.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$us"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What force is exerted by each side on the hinge?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium. Given that the forces exerted by the hinge are internal, action-reaction pairs, it may be again easiest to consider one board of the sign only.
END_HINT
