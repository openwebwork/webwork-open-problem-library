$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose a \($mcar\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) car parks on the \($mbridge\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) bridge in the above figure with its center of mass halfway between the hinges and the cable attachments. (The bridge is supported by the cables and hinges only. Note that the diagram only shows one cable, but there are two cables, one on each side of the bridge's "bed.")

$PAR

a) Find the tension in each of the two cables.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces. At minimum, how many cables affix the drawbridge to the winch on the left side of the figure? What is the tension in each cable?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Tpercable"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Find the direction of the force exerted by the hinges on the bridge.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} degrees from the positive \(x\)- axis

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
