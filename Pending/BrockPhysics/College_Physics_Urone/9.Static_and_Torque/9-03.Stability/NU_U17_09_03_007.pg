$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose the weight of the drawbridge in the above figure is supported entirely by its hinges
and the opposite shore, so that its cables are slack. 

$PAR

a) What fraction of the weight is supported by the opposite shore if the point of support is directly beneath the cable attachments?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin with the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT 


ANS(num_cmp("$ratio"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the direction and magnitude of the force the hinges exert on the bridge under these circumstances? The mass of the bridge is \($w\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) acting at \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the positive \(x\)- axis

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
