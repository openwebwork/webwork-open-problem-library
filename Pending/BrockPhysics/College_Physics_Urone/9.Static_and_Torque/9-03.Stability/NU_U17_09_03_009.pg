$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A sandwich board advertising sign is constructed as shown in the above figure. The sign's
mass is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\).
 
$PAR

a) Calculate the tension in the chain assuming no friction between the legs and the sidewalk.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Isolate one board of the sign and begin with the second condition for static equilibrium. Given that the total mass of the sign is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\), what then is the mass of one board? The normal force exerted on one board?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$T"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What force is exerted by each side on the hinge?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium. Given that the forces exerted by the hinge are internal, action-reaction pairs, it may be again easiest to consider one board of the sign only.
