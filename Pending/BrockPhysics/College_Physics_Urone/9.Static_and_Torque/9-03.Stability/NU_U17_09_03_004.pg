$PAR

A person carries a plank of wood \($d\) \(\textrm{m}\) long with one hand pushing down on it at one end with a force \(F_1\) and the other hand holding it up with a force of \(F_2\) applied at a distance of \($r2\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the same end of the plank. The plank has a mass of \($m1\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and its centre of gravity is at the middle of the plank.

$PAR

a) What is the force \(F_1\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
