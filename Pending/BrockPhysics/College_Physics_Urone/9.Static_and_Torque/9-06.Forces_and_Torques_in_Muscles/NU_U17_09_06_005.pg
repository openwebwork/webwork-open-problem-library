$PAR

A person working at a drafting board may hold her head as shown in the figure above, requiring muscle action to support the head. The three major acting forces are shown. Calculate the direction and magnitude of the force supplied by the upper vertebrae to hold the head stationary, assuming that this force acts along a line through the centre of mass, as do the weight and muscle force.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) acting at   \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees from the positive \(x\)- axis.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium. Further recall that forces are vectors and must be added geometrically, tip-to-tail. You may find it easiest to resolve the forces exerted on the woman's head into their horizontal and vertical components.
