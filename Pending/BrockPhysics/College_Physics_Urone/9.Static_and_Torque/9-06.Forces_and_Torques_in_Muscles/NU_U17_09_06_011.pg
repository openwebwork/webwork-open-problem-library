$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Integrated Concepts: Suppose we replace the \($mbook\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) book in the figure above with an elastic exercise rope that obeys Hooke's Law and that has a force constant \(k\) = \($k\) \(\textrm{N/m}\).

$PAR

a) How much is the rope stretched (past equilibrium) to provide the same force as the book? Assume the rope is held in the hand at the same location as the book. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for the distance extended by first equating the book's weight and the spring force?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$x"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What force is on the biceps muscle if the exercise rope is pulled straight up so that the forearm makes an angle of \($angle ^{\circ}\) with the horizontal? Assume the biceps muscle is still perpendicular to the forearm.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces. Which forces are applied at an angle to the forearm?
