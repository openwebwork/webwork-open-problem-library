<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR


a) What magnitude of force should the woman in the figure above exert on the floor with each hand to
do a push-up? Assume that she moves up at a constant speed. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that "constant speed" may be interpreted as "zero net torque". Note that the question is asking for the force exerted by <i>each</i> hand. It might help you to recall Newton's Third Law.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fr"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) The triceps muscle at the back of her upper arm has an effective lever arm of \(1.75\) \(\textrm{cm}\), and she exerts force on the floor at a horizontal distance of \(20.0\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from the elbow joint. Calculate the magnitude of the force in each triceps muscle.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Again, given that the woman moves at a constant speed, begin with the second condition for static equilibrium. It might help you to consider the torques exerted on one arm only.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ft"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) How much work does she do if her centre of mass rises \(0.240\) \(\textrm{m}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of work done by a constant force. Given that the woman moves at a constant speed, to what must the upwardly-directed exerted force be equal?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$W"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

d) What is her useful power output if she does \(25\) pushups in one minute? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of average power.
END_HINT
