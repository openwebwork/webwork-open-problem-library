$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Unlike most of the other muscles in our bodies, the masseter muscle in the jaw, as illustrated in the figure above, is attached relatively far from the joint, enabling large forces to be exerted by the back teeth.
 
$PAR

a) Using the information in the figure, calculate the force exerted by the teeth on the bullet.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) upward

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces. It may help you to recall Newton's Third Law.
END_HINT
