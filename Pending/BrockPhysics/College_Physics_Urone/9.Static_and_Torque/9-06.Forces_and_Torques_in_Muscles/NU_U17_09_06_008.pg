<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A \($m\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) man stands on his toes by exerting an upward force through the Achilles tendon, as in the figure above.
 
$PAR

a) What is the force in the Achilles tendon if he stands on one foot? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) upward

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fa"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Calculate the force at the pivot of the simplified lever system shownâ€” that force is representative of forces in the ankle joint.
 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) downward

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
