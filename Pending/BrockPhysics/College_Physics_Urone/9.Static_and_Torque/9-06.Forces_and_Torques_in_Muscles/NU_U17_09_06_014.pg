$PAR

Unreasonable Results: Suppose two children are using a uniform seesaw that is \(3.00\) \(\textrm{m}\) long and has its centre of mass over the pivot. The first child has a mass of \($weight1\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and sits \($x1\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the pivot. 

$PAR

a) Calculate where the second \($weight2\) \(\textrm{kg}\) child must sit to balance the seesaw.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\) from the opposite end of the seesaw

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
