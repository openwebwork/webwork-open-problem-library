$PAR

Two children push on opposite sides of a door during play. Both push horizontally and
perpendicular to the door. One child pushes with a force of \($F\) \(\textrm{N}\) at a distance of
\($r1\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the hinges, and the second child pushes at a distance of \($r2\) \(\textrm{m}\). What force must the second child exert to keep the door from moving? Assume friction is negligible.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
