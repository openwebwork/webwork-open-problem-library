<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

The two children shown in the figure above are balanced on a seesaw of negligible mass. The leftmost child has a mass of \($m1\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and sits \($r1\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of \($m2\) \(\textrm{kg}\). Use the second condition for equilibrium to calculate \(F_p\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you use the second condition for static equilibrium to write and solve two simultaneous equations, one in which the unknown variable is the distance from the heavier child to the fulcrum and the other, the supporting force? You will have to select a different pivot for each.
