$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this problem correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

The two children shown in the figure above are balanced on a seesaw. The leftmost child has a mass of \($m1\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and sits \($r1\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of \($m2\) \(\textrm{kg}\). The seesaw has a mass \($ms\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and a center of mass located
\($rs\) \(\textrm{m}\) to the left of the pivot (on the side of the lighter child).

$PAR

a) How far from the pivot does the heavier child sit?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$r2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Calculate \(F_p\), the supporting force exerted by the pivot.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the first condition for static equilibrium.
