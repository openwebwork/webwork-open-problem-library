$PAR

To get up on the roof, a person (mass \($mman\) \(\textrm{kg}\)) places a \($length\)-\(\textrm{m}\) aluminum ladder (mass \($mladder\) \(\textrm{kg}\)) against the house on a concrete pad with the base of the ladder \($width\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the house. The ladder rests against a plastic rain gutter, which we can assume to be frictionless. The centre of mass of the ladder is \($dladder\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the bottom (<i>i.e.</i> \($dladder\) \(\textrm{m}\) up its length). The person is standing \($dman\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the bottom. What are the magnitudes of the forces on the ladder at the top and bottom?

$PAR

At the top: \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)
$PAR
At the bottom: \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces. The rain gutter is approximately cylindrical and will thus exert a normal force perpendicular to a flat object resting against its length.
