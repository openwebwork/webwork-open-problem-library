In the figure above, the centre of gravity of the pole held by the pole vaulter is \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\) from the left hand, and the hands are \($l\) \(\textrm{m}\) apart. The pole has mass \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\). Calculate the force exerted by

Recall the second condition for static equilibrium. Choose your pivot wisely so as to eliminate unknown forces.
