What is the peak emf generated by a \($radiusSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) radius, \($turns\)-turn coil is rotated one-fourth of a revolution in \($time\) \(\textrm{ms}\), originally having its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field with a strength of \($strengthSI\) \(\textrm{T}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the emf induced in a generator coil. How many revolutions does the coil turn each second? How many radians? What maximum value does the sine function attain on its period?
