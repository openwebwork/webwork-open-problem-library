A bicycle generator rotates at \($omega\) \(\textrm{rad/s}\), producing an \($emfSI\) \(\textrm{V}\) peak emf. It has a \($length\) \(\textrm{cm}\) by \($width\) \(\textrm{cm}\) rectangular coil in a \($strengthSI\) \(\textrm{T}\) field. How many turns are in the coil?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the formula for the emf induced in a generator coil to solve for the number of turns? What maximum value does the sine function attain on its period?
