A car generator turns at \($rpm\) \(\textrm{rpm}\) when the engine is idling. Its \($turns\)-turn, \($length\) \(\textrm{cm}\) by \($width\) \(\textrm{cm}\) rectangular coil rotates in an adjustable magnetic field so that it can produce sufficient voltage even at low rpms. What is the field strength needed to produce a \($emfSI\) \(\textrm{V}\) peak emf?

BEGIN_HINT
