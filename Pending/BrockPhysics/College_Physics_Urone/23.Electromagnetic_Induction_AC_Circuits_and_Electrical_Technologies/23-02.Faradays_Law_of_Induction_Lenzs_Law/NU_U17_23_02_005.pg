Suppose a \($turns\)-turn coil lies in the plane of the page in a uniform magnetic field that is directed into the page. The coil originally has an area of \($areaSI\) \(\textrm{m}^2\). It is stretched to have no area in \($timeSI\) \(\textrm{s}\). What is the magnitude of the induced emf if the uniform magnetic field has a strength of \($strengthSI\) \(\textrm{T}\)?
