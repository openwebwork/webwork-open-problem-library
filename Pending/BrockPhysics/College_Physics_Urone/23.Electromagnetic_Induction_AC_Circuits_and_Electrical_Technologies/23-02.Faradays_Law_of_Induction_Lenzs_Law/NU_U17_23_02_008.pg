An emf is induced by rotating a \($turns\)-turn, \($diameter\) \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter coil in the Earth's \($strength \times 10^{-5}\) \(\textrm{T}\) magnetic field. What average emf is induced, given the plane of the coil is originally perpendicular to the Earth's field and is rotated to be parallel to the field in \($time\) \(\textrm{ms}\)?
