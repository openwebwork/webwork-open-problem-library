<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A very large, superconducting solenoid such as one used in MRI scans, stores \($energy\) \(\textrm{MJ}\) of energy in its magnetic field when \($currentSI\) \(\textrm{A}\) flows.

b) If the coils “go normal,” they gain resistance and start to dissipate thermal energy. What temperature increase is produced if all the stored energy goes into heating the \($massSI\) \(\textrm{kg}\) magnet, given its average specific heat is \($heatcapSI\) \(\textrm{J/kg}\)\(^{\circ}\textrm{C}\)?

Can you devise an equation wherein the energy stored in the solenoid's magnetic field is converted entirely into thermal energy absorbed by the magnet?
