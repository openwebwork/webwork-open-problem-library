In the August 1992 space shuttle flight, only \($lengthSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) of the conducting tether could be let out. A \($emfSI\) \(\textrm{V}\) motional emf was generated in the Earth's \($strength \times 10^{-5}\) \(\textrm{T}\) field, while moving at \($speed \times 10^{3}\) \(\textrm{m/s}\). What was the angle between the shuttle's velocity and the Earth's field, assuming the conductor was perpendicular to the field?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for motional emf. Should you use the component of velocity that is parallel or perpendicular to Earth's magnetic field in your calculations? It might help you to sketch a diagram.
