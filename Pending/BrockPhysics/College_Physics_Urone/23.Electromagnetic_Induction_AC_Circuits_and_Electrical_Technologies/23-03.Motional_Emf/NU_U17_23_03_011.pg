A Tethered Satellite is \($length\) \(\textrm{km}\) long, producing \($voltage\) \(\textrm{kV}\), and a current of \($currentSI\) \(\textrm{A}\) flows, in the Earth's \($strength \times 10^{-5}\) \(\textrm{T}\) field.

a) What magnetic drag force does this produce if the system is moving at \($speed\) \(\textrm{km/s}\)?
