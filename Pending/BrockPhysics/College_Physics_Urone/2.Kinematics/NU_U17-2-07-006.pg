$PAR
A swimmer bounces straight up from a diving board and falls feet first into a pool. She starts with a velocity of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\), and her takeoff point is \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) above the pool. 

$PAR

a) How long are her feet in the air? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is her highest point above the board?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What is the magnitude of her velocity when her feet hit the water?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the height of the swimmer's feet can be modelled by a quadratic function with height as a function of time.
$PAR
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
