$PAR
A ball is thrown straight up. It passes a \($h \, \(\textrm{m}\) high window \($b \, \(\textrm{m}\) off the ground on its path up and takes \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\) to traverse the window. What was the ball's initial velocity?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
