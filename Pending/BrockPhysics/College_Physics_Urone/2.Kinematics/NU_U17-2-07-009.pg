BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
You throw a ball straight up with an initial velocity of \(15.0 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\). It passes a tree branch on the way up at a height of \(7.00 \, \(\textrm{m}\). How much additional time will pass before the ball passes the tree branch on the way back down?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
$PAR
Also consider using the quadratic formula to find the length of time the ball is above the branch.
