$speed = random(20,40,0.1);
$distance = random(1.5,2,0.01);
$A1 = (2)*($distance)/((0)+($speed));

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Blood is accelerated from rest to \($speed \, \(\textrm{cm/s}\) in a distance of \($distance\, \(\textrm{cm}\) by the left ventricle of the heart. How long does the acceleration take?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));
BEGIN_HINT
Since both measures of distance are in the same units it is not necessary to convert to meters!
$PAR
You can find the average velocity by adding the final and initial velocities, then dividing that number by two.
