<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
The speed of propagation of the action potential (an electrical signal) in a nerve cell depends (inversely) on the diameter of the axon (nerve fiber). If the nerve cell connecting the spinal cord to your feet is \($length \, \textrm{m}\) long, and the nerve impulse speed is \($speed \, \textrm{m/s}\), how long does it take for the nerve signal to travel this distance?
