$time = random(1.5,2,0.01);
$deceleration = random(2,2.5,0.01);

$A1 = ($time)*($deceleration)*(10);

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A well-thrown ball is caught in a well-padded mitt. If the acceleration of the ball has magnitude \($deceleration\times 10^{4} \, \textrm{m/s}^2\), and \($time \, \textrm{ms}\) elapses from the time the ball first touches the mitt until it stops, what was the initial speed of the ball?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\) 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));
BEGIN_HINT
Remember that acceleration does not always mean an increase in speed.
$PAR
The ball starts with a velocity and accelerates negatively until it comes to a rest.
