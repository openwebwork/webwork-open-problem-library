$PAR
A steel ball is dropped onto a hard floor from a height of \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) and rebounds to a height of \($u \, \(\textrm{m}\).

$PAR

a) Calculate its downward velocity just before it strikes the floor.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Calculate its upward velocity just after it leaves the floor on its way back up. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice the symmetry of the ball's motion. Although it does not return to the same height, its acceleration still follows the same pattern.
