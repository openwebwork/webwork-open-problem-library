a) A world record was set for the men's \(100 \, \(\textrm{m}\) dash in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing by Usain Bolt of Jamaica. Bolt “coasted” across the finish line with a time of \(9.69 \, \(\textrm{s}\). If we assume that Bolt accelerated for \(3.00 \, \(\textrm{s}\) to reach his maximum speed, and maintained that speed for the rest of the race, calculate his maximum speed and his acceleration.

BEGIN_TEXT
b) During the same Olympics, Bolt also set the world record in the \(200 \, \(\textrm{m}\) dash with a time of \(19.30 \, \(\textrm{s}\). Using the same assumptions as for the \(100 \, \(\textrm{m}\) dash (that is, it took him \(3.00 \, \(\textrm{s}\) to reach maximum speed), what was his maximum speed for this race?

BEGIN_HINT
Divide the motion into its component parts (i.e, when he is accelerating, when he is moving with constant velocity, etc.).
$PAR
Use the components to find the unknowns.
