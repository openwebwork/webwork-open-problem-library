$PAR

A bullet in a gun is accelerated from the firing chamber to the end of the barrel at an average rate of \($acceleration \times 10^{5} \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\) for \($time \times 10^{-4} \, \(\textrm{s}\). What is its muzzle velocity (that is, its final velocity)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));
BEGIN_HINT
The bullet is originally stationary in the barrel of the gun. This means that its initial velocity is zero.
