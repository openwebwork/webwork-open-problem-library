In 1967, New Zealander Burt Munro set the world record for an Indian motorcycle, on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, of \(183.58 \, \(\textrm{mi/h}\) (\(82.068 \,\(\textrm{m/s}\)). The one-way course was \(5.00 \, \(\textrm{mi}\) long (\(8050\ \, \(\textrm{m}\)). Acceleration rates are often described by the time it takes to reach \(60.0 \, \(\textrm{mi/h}\) (\(26.8 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)) from rest. If this time was \(4.00 \, \(\textrm{s}\), and Burt accelerated at this rate until he reached his maximum speed, how long did it take Burt to complete the course?

BEGIN_HINT
Divide motion into component parts, i.e. motion with constant acceleration, motion with constant velocity, etc.
