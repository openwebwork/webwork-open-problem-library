On May 26, 1934, a streamlined, stainless steel diesel train called the Zephyr set the world's nonstop long-distance speed record for trains. Its run from Denver to Chicago took \(13\) hours, \(4\) minutes, \(58\) seconds, and was witnessed by more than a million people along the route. The total distance traveled was \(1633.8\, \textrm{km}\). What was its average speed in m/s?
