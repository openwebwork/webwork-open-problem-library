$PAR

The planetary model of the atom pictures electrons orbiting the atomic nucleus much as planets orbit the Sun. In this model you can view hydrogen, the simplest atom, as having a single electron in a circular orbit \($distance \times 10^{-10}\) \(\textrm{m}\) in diameter. (a) If the average speed of the electron in this orbit is known to be \($speed \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{m/s}\), calculate the number of revolutions per second it makes about the nucleus. (b) What is the electron's average velocity over five complete revolutions?

$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
a) Find the distance traveled by the electron for every revolution. How many times can it travel this distance in one second?
