<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A powerful motorcycle can accelerate from rest to \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in only \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\).

$PAR

a) What is its average acceleration?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How far does it travel in that time?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that acceleration is the change in velocity over time.
