$PAR
Tidal friction is slowing the rotation of the Earth. As a result, the orbit of the Moon is increasing in radius at a rate of approximately \(4\, \textrm{cm/year}\). Assuming this to be a constant rate, how many years will pass before the radius of the Moon's orbit increases by \(3.84 \times 10^{6} \, \textrm{m}\) (which is \(1%\) of its current value)?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{years}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Don't forget to convert distances to the same units.
$PAR
Is the figure \(1%\) of the current orbital radius relevant to the problem?
