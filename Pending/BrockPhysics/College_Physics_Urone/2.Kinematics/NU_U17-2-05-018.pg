BEGIN_TEXT

A dragster can reach a top speed of \($V \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in only \($T \, \(\textrm{s}\).
$PAR
a) Calculate the average acceleration for such a dragster.

BEGIN_TEXT

b) Find the final velocity of this dragster starting from rest and accelerating at the rate found in (a) for \(402 \, \(\textrm{m}\) (a quarter mile) without using any information on time. Assume a constant acceleration. Note this is not valid for a dragster, which would reach a terminal speed in actuality.

BEGIN_HINT
$PAR
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
