$PAR
In a slap shot, a hockey player accelerates the puck from a velocity of \($speed1 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) to \($speed2 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in the same direction. If this shot takes \($time \times 10^{-2} \, \(\textrm{s}\), calculate the distance over which the puck accelerates.

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));
BEGIN_HINT
Remember that acceleration is the change in velocity over time.
