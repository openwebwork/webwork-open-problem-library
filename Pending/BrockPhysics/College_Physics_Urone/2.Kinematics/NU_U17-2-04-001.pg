BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A cheetah can accelerate from rest to a speed of \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\). What is its acceleration?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
In this case, acceleration is how many meters per second the cheetah increases its speed by over an amount of time. What would you do to find the average increase in speed per second?
