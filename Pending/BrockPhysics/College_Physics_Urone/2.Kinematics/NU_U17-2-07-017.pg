<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A coin is dropped from a hot-air balloon that is \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) above the ground and rising at \(10.0 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) upward. For the coin, find:

$PAR

a) the maximum height reached,
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b)  its position \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\) after being released,
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) and the time before it hits the ground.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
$PAR
Notice the symmetry of the coin's motion. Consider how it can be modeled by a quadratic function in order to solve part c.
