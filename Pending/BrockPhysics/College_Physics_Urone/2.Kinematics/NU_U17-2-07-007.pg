a) Calculate the height of a cliff if it takes \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\) for a rock to hit the ground when it is thrown straight up from the cliff with an initial velocity of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How long would it take to reach the ground if it is thrown straight down with the same speed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the height of the ball can be modeled by a quadratic function with height as a function of time.
$PAR
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
