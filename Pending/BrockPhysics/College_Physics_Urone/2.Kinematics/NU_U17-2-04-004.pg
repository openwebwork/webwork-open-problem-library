$PAR

Assume that an intercontinental ballistic missile goes from rest to a suborbital speed of \($speed \, \textrm{km/s}\) in \($time \, \textrm{s}\) (the actual speed and time are classified). What is its average acceleration in \(\textrm{m/s}^2\) and in multiples of \(g\)?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(38)\} \(g\)

BEGIN_HINT
How do the units of velocity and acceleration relate to each other?
$PAR
How does the quantity \(g\) relate to the acceleration of the missile?
