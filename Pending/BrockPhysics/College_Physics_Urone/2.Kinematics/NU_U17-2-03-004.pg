$velocity = random(4,8,0.1);
$displacement = random(500,700,1);

$A1 = ($displacement)*(1000)*(100)/($velocity);

<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Land west of the San Andreas fault in southern California is moving at an average velocity of about \($velocity\, \textrm{cm/year}\) northwest relative to land east of the fault. Los Angeles is west of the fault and may thus someday be at the same latitude as San Francisco, which is east of the fault. How far in the future will this occur if the displacement to be made is \($displacement \,\textrm{km}\) northwest, assuming the motion remains constant?

Remember to convert to the same units of distance.
