BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
At the end of a race, a runner decelerates from a velocity of \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) at a rate of \($rate\textrm{m/s}^2\).
$PAR

a) How far does she travel in the next \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\) 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is her final velocity? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\) 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));
BEGIN_HINT
Notice that she is decelerating at the end of the race, so she is slowing down, not speeding up.
