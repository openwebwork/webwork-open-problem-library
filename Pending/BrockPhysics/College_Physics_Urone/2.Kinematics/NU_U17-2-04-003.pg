<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR

A commuter backs her car out of her garage with an acceleration of \($acceleration \, \textrm{m/s}^2\).

$PAR

a) How long does it take her to reach a speed of \($speed \, \textrm{m/s}\)? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If she then brakes to a stop in \($time \, \textrm{s}\), what is her acceleration?
$PAR

\(-\) \{ans_rule(38)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Make note of what each piece of given information represents and take a close look at the five fundamental kinematics equations.
