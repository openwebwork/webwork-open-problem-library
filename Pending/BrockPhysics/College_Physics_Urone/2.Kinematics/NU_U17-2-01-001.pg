<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR

Find the following for path A:

$PAR
a) The distance traveled.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$a"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) The magnitude of the displacement from start to finish.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$b"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) The displacement from start to finish.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
a) Remember that distance is a scalar, and therefore has no sign.
$PAR
b) Although displacement is a vector, and therefore has a sign, the magnitude of the displacement is a scalar, and therefore is either positive or zero.
$PAR
c) Remember that displacement is a vector, and therefore has a sign.
