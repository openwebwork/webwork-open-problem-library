BEGIN_TEXT
Dr. John Paul Stapp was U.S. Air Force officer who studied the effects of extreme deceleration on the human body. On December 10, 1954, Stapp rode a rocket sled, accelerating from rest to a top speed of \(282 \textrm{m/s}\) (\(1015 \textrm{km/h}\)) in \(5.00 \textrm{s}\), and was brought jarringly back to rest in only \(1.40 \textrm{s}\)! Calculate the magnitude of his (a) acceleration as he sped up and (b) acceleration as he slowed down. Express each in multiples of \(g\) (\(\textrm{9.80 m/s}^{2}\)) by taking its ratio to the acceleration of gravity.
