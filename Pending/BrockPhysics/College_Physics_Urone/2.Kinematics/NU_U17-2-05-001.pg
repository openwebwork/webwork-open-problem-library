BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
An Olympic-class sprinter starts a race with an acceleration of \($acceleration \, \textrm{m/s}^2\). What is her speed \($time \, \textrm{s}\) later? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
At the beginning of the race, the runner had an initial velocity of zero. The acceleration given shows how much she increases her speed by every second she is running.
