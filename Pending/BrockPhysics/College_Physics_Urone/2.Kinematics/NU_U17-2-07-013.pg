$PAR
There is a \(250 \, \(\textrm{m}\) high cliff at Half Dome in Yosemite National Park in California. Suppose a boulder breaks loose from the top of this cliff.

$PAR

a) How fast will it be going when it strikes the ground?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Assuming a reaction time of \(0.300 \, \(\textrm{s}\), how long will a tourist at the bottom have to get out of the way after hearing the sound of the rock breaking loose (neglecting the height of the tourist, which would become negligible anyway if hit)? The speed of sound is \(335 \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) on this day.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
$PAR
Make sure to take into account the time it takes for the sound of the rock breaking to reach the tourist.
