$PAR
A football quarterback runs \($d1 \, \textrm{m}\) straight down the playing field in \($t1 \, \textrm{s}\). He is then hit and pushed \($d2 \, \textrm{m}\) straight backward in \($t2 \, \textrm{s}\). He breaks the tackle and runs straight forward another \($d3 \, \textrm{m}\) in \($t3 \, \textrm{s}\). Calculate his average velocity (a) for each of the three intervals and (b) for the entire motion.
$PAR
a)
$PAR
\(v_1\) = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)
$PAR
\(v_2\) = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)
$PAR
\(v_3\) = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
b)
$PAR

\(v\) = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A4"));

BEGIN_HINT
The velocities in part a) can be treated like speeds since they are in the same direction as the quarterback's displacement.
$PAR
You must find the total displacement of the quarterback to find his total velocity.
