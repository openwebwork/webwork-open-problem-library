$PAR
While entering a freeway, a car accelerates from rest at a rate of \($acceleration\, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\) for \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\). To help with this question, draw a sketch of the situation and list the knowns in this problem. 

$PAR

a) How far does the car travel in those \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the car's final velocity?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
How do the units of each piece of given information relate to each other?
