$PAR
A swan on a lake gets airborne by flapping its wings and running on top of the water. 

$PAR

a) If the swan must reach a velocity of \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) to take off and it accelerates from rest at an average rate of \($a \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\), how far will it travel before becoming airborne? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

b) How long does this take?
$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
