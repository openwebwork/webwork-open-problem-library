<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A helicopter blade spins at exactly \($revs\) revolutions per minute. Its tip is \($length\, \textrm{m}\) from the centre of rotation.
$PAR

a)  Calculate the average speed of the blade tip in the helicopter's frame of reference.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is its average velocity over one revolution?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) Remember that you must find the total distance traveled by the blade tip in order to calculate the speed.
$PAR
b) Remember that velocity is related to displacement, not distance traveled.
