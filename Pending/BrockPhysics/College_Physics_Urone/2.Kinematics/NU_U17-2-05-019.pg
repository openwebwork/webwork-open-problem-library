$PAR
A bicycle racer sprints at the end of a race to clinch a victory. The racer has an initial velocity of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) and accelerates at the rate of \($a \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)  for \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\).  What is his final velocity?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
