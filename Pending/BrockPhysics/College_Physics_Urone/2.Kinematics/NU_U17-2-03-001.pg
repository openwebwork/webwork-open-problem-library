BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) Calculate Earth's average speed relative to the Sun, assuming the distance between the two is \(1.50 \times 10^{11} \, \textrm{m}\). Also assume that there are \(365.25\) days in a year.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is Earth's average velocity relative to the Sun over a period of one year?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) The distance between the earth and the sun is the radius of the Earth's orbit. The total distance traveled is the circumference of the orbit.
$PAR
b) Remember that a year is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the sun. What does this mean for the total displacement?
