$a = random(2,4,0.1);
$b = random(1,4,0.1);
$A1 = sqrt((2)*(9.8)*($a));

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Consider a grey squirrel falling out of a tree to the ground.

$PAR

a) If we ignore air resistance in this case (only for the sake of this problem), determine a squirrel's velocity just before hitting the ground, assuming it fell from a height of \($a \, \(\textrm{m}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If the squirrel stops in a distance of \($b \, \(\textrm{cm}\) through bending its limbs, what is its deceleration?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
