$PAR

a) A light-rail commuter train accelerates at a rate of \($acceleration \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\). How long does it take to reach its top speed of \($speed \, \(\textrm{km/h}\), starting from rest?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) The same train ordinarily decelerates at a rate of \($deceleration \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\). How long does it take to come to a stop from its top speed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) In emergencies the train can decelerate more rapidly, coming to rest from \($speed\textrm{km/h} \) in \($time \textrm {s} \). What is its emergency deceleration?

$PAR

\(-\) \{ans_rule(38)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Each part of this problem can be solved using the same acceleration formula rearranged.
