$v = random(6,8,0.01);

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
An unwary football player collides with a padded goalpost while running at a velocity of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) and comes to a full stop after compressing the padding and his body \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\).

$PAR

a) What is his deceleration?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How long does the collision last?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
