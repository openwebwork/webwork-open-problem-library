$v = random(10,12,0.01);

<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A very strong, but inept, shot putter puts the shot straight up vertically with an initial velocity of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\). How long does he have to get out of the way if the shot was released at a height of \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\), and he is \(2 \, \(\textrm{m}\) tall?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the height of the shot can be modeled by a quadratic function with height as a function of time.
$PAR
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
