BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A basketball referee tosses the ball straight up for the starting tip-off. At what velocity must a basketball player leave the ground to rise \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) above the floor in an attempt to get the ball?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the acceleration of the basketball player once he takes off will be that of gravity.
$PAR
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
