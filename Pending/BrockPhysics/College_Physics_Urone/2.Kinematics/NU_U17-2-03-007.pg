<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR

A student drove to the university from her home and noted that the odometer reading of her car increased by \($odometer \, \textrm{km}\). The trip took \($time \, \textrm{min}\).

$PAR

a) What was her average speed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km/h}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If the straight-line distance from her home to the university is \($distance \, \textrm{km}\) in a direction \($angle^\circ\) south of east, what was her average velocity in this direction? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km/h}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) If she arrived home by the same path \(7\) \(\textrm{h}\) \(30\) \(\textrm{min}\) after she left, what were her average speed and velocity for the entire trip?

$PAR

Average Speed = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{km/h}\) 
$PAR
Average Velocity = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{km/h}\) 
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));
ANS(num_cmp("$A4"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) Don't forget to convert the time to hours.
$PAR
b) Because the velocity you are finding is in the same direction as her displacement, the angle given is not needed for your calculation.
$PAR
c)This is just like the parts a and b, but with a new total time of \(7 \, \(\textrm{h}\) \(30\ \, \(\textrm{min}\).
