$PAR
A woodpecker's brain is specially protected from large decelerations by tendon-like attachments inside the skull. While pecking on a tree, the woodpecker's head comes to a stop from an initial velocity of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) in a distance of only \($d1 \, \(\textrm{mm}\).

$PAR

a) Find the acceleration in multiples of \(9.8\, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\) (\(g\)).

BEGIN_TEXT
c) The tendons cradling the brain stretch, making its stopping distance \($d2 \, \(\textrm{mm}\) (greater than the head and, hence, less deceleration of the brain). What is the brain's deceleration, expressed in multiples of \(g\) ?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
