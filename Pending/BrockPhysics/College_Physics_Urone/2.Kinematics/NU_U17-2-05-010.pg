$PAR
Freight trains can produce only relatively small accelerations and decelerations.
$PAR

a) What is the final velocity of a freight train that accelerates at a rate of \($accel \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\) for \($time \, \(\textrm{min}\), starting with an initial velocity of \($velocity \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?  
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b)  If the train can slow down at a rate of \($accel2 \, \(\textrm{m/s}^2\), how long will it take to come to a stop from this velocity?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
