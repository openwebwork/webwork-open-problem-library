$PAR
Calculate the displacement and velocity at time \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\) for a rock thrown straight down with an initial speed of \($v \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) from the Verrazano Narrows Bridge in New York City. The roadway of this bridge is \(70.0 \, \(\textrm{m}\) above the water. Take upwards to be the positive direction.

$PAR

Displacement = \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

Velocity = \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));
ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the rock is moving downward. In this problem's frame of reference, downward is indicated by a negative.
$PAR
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
