BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose you drop a rock into a dark well and, using precision equipment, you measure the time for the sound of a splash to return. Neglecting the time required for sound to travel up the well, calculate the distance to the water if the sound returns in \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\).

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the fundamental kinematics equations. Consider the given information to find which of these equations will be helpful in solving the problem.
