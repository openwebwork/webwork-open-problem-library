<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Calculate the approximate force on a square meter of sail, given the horizontal velocity of the wind is \($v2\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) parallel to its front surface and \($v1\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) along its back surface. Take the density of air to be \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\). 

$PAR

The calculation, based on Bernoulli's principle, is approximate due to the effects of turbulence.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a pressure gradient results in a force exerted on the surface of an object. Be careful - the question is asking for force <i>per unit area</i>. What unit is that?
