<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) What is the pressure drop due to the Bernoulli effect as water goes into a \($d2\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-diameter nozzle from a \($d1\)-\(\textrm{cm}\)-diameter fire hose while carrying a flow of \($QLs\) \(\textrm{L/s}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the equation of continuity. The volume flow rate of an incompressible fluid is unchanged as it traverses a pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Can you solve for the initial and final velocities and then use these results in conjunction with Bernoulli's equation to determine the pressure drop?
END_HINT

ANS($P1P2->cmp);

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) To what maximum height above the nozzle can this water rise? (The actual height will be significantly smaller due to air resistance).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for the maximum height attained using conservation of energy?
