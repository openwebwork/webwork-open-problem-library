$PAR

Water supplied to a house by a water main has a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^5\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) early on a summer day when neighbourhood use is low. This pressure produces a flow of \($Qha\) \(\textrm{L/min}\) through a garden hose. Later in the day, pressure at the exit of the water main and entrance to the house drops, and a flow of only \($Qh1a\) \(\textrm{L/min}\) is obtained through the same hose. 

$PAR

a) What pressure is now being supplied to the house, assuming resistance is constant? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$P21"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) By what factor did the flow rate in the water main increase in order to cause this decrease in pressure delivered to the house? The pressure at the entrance of the water main is \($pressure3 \times 10^5\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\), and the original flow rate was \($QmLmin\) \(\textrm{L/min}\). 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you find and equate two equivalent expressions for the resistance of the pipe, one in terms of the morning water usage parameters and the other in terms of those pertaining to the afternoon? Note the pressure at the entrance to the water main is constant.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Qmm"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) How many more users are there, assuming each would consume \($Qha\) \(\textrm{L/min}\) in the morning and \($Qh1a\) \(\textrm{L/min}\) in the afternoon?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} more users in the afternoon

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Pay attention to the wording of the question -  you are being asked to find the <i>excess</i> of users in the afternoon.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$users"));
