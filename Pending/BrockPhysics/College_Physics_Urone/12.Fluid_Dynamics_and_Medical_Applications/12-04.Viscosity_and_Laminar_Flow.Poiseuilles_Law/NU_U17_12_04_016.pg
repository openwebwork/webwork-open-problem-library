When physicians diagnose arterial blockages, they quote the reduction in flow rate. If
the flow rate in an artery has been reduced to \(10.0\)\(\textrm{%}\) of its normal value by a blood
clot and the average pressure difference has increased by \(20.0\)\(\textrm{%}\), by what factor has
the clot reduced the radius of the artery?
