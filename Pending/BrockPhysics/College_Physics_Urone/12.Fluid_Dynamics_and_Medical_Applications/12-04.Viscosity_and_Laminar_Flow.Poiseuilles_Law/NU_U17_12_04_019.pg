An oil gusher shoots crude oil \($x\) \(\textrm{m}\) into the air through a pipe with a \($d\)-\(\textrm{m}\) diameter. Neglecting air resistance but not the resistance of the pipe, and assuming laminar flow, calculate the pressure at the bottom of the \($h\)-\(\textrm{m}\)-long vertical pipe. Take the density of the oil to be \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\) and its viscosity to be \(1.00 \textrm{N/m}^2\) (or \(\textrm{Pa}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s}\)). Note that you must take into account the pressure due to the \($h\)-\(\textrm{m}\) column of oil in the pipe.

BEGIN_HINT
Solve this problem in two stages. What is the pressure due to the weight of the oil from the bottom of the pipe to the Earth's surface? Then, using Poiseuille's law for laminar flow, determine the pressure difference across the exposed gusher (what is the gauge pressure at its top?). It follows that the pressure at the bottom of the pipe is the sum of these two components.
