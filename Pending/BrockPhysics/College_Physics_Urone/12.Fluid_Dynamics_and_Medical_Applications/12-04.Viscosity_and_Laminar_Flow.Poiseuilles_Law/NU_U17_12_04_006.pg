$PAR

Fluid originally flows through a tube at a rate of \($Q\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\). To illustrate the sensitivity of flow rate to various factors, calculate the new flow rate for the following changes with all other factors remaining the same as in the original conditions.

$PAR

a) Pressure difference increases by a factor of \(1.50\).

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\)

b) A new fluid with \(3.00\) times greater viscosity is substituted.

c) The tube is replaced by one having \(4.00\) times the length.

$PAR

d) Another tube is used with a radius \(0.100\) times the original.

e) Yet another tube is substituted with a radius \(0.100\) times the original and half the length, and the pressure difference is increased by a factor of \(1.50\).

BEGIN_HINT
For each of (a) through (e), recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow. To what exponent is each parameter raised?
