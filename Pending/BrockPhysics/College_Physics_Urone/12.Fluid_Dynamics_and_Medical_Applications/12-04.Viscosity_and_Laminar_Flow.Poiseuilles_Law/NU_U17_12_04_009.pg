<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose a blood vessel's radius is decreased to \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) of its original value by plaque deposits and the body compensates by increasing the pressure difference along the vessel to keep the flow rate constant.
 
$PAR

By what factor must the pressure difference increase?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

BEGIN_HINT
Recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow. To what exponent is the radius parameter raised?
