$PAR

What force is needed to pull one microscope slide over another at a speed of \($vcm\) \(\textrm{cm/s}\), if there is a \($Lmm\)-\(\textrm{mm}\)-thick layer of \(20 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) water between them and the contact area is \($Acm\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the viscous drag force acting on a fluid undergoing laminar flow. You will have to research the viscosity of water at the given temperature. Given that the microscope slide is pulled along at a constant speed, what can be said about the magnitude of the applied force?
