<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Find the terminal speed of a \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) skydiver having a surface area of \($SA\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and taking the drag force to be \(F_D = 1/2pAv^{2}\).

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin by identifying the forces acting on the skydiver through their descent. Recall that an object attains its terminal speed when there is no longer an imbalance of forces in the vertical direction.\
