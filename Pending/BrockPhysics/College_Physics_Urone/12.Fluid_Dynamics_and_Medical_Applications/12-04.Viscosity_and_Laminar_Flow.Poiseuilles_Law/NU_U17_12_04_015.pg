$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

An intravenous (IV) system having a needle of radius \($R\) \(\textrm{mm}\) and length \($L\) \(\textrm{cm}\) supplies saline solution to a patient whose blood is at a gauge pressure of \($p1\) \(\textrm{mm Hg}\).

$PAR

a) What pressure difference is created at a depth of \($ha\) \(\textrm{m}\) in a saline solution, assuming its density is that of sea water?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the gauge pressure of a fluid to its density and the specified depth.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$P2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Calculate the new flow rate if the height of the saline solution is decreased to \(1.50\) \(\textrm{m}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow. Following along the lines of your calculation in part (a), what is the pressure at this new height?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Qb"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) At what height would the direction of flow be reversed? This reversal can be a problem when patients stand up. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow. At what height is the flow rate zero? The flow rate will reverse direction at some differential height less than this critical height.
END_HINT
