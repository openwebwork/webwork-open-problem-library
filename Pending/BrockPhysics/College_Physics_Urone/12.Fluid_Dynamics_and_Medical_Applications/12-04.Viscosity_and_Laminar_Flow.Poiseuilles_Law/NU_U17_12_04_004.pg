$PAR

The pressure drop along a length of artery is \($P\) \(\textrm{Pa}\), the radius is \($rmm\) \(\textrm{mm}\), and the flow is laminar. The average speed of the blood is \($vmm\) \(\textrm{mm/s}\). 

$PAR

a) What is the net force on the blood in this section of artery? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a pressure gradient results in a force exerted on the surface of an object, and further recall that pressure is defined as the force per unit area.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the power expended maintaining the flow?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{mW}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can the formula for instantaneous power be manipulated such that it becomes a function of force and velocity?
END_HINT
