During a marathon race, a runner's blood flow increases to \($inc\) times her resting rate. Her blood's viscosity has dropped to \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) of its normal value, and the blood pressure difference across the circulatory system has increased by \(50.0\)\(\textrm{%}\). By what factor has the average radii of her blood vessels increased?
