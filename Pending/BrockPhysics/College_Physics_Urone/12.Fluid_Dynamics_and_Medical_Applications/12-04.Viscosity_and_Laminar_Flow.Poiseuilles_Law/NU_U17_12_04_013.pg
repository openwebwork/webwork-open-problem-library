A layer of oil \($Lmm\) \(\textrm{mm}\) thick is placed between two microscope slides. Researchers find that a force of \($Ff \times 10^{-4}\) \(\textrm{N}\) is required to glide one over the other at a speed of \($vcm\) \(\textrm{cm/s}\) when their contact area is \($Acm\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\). What is the oil's viscosity?
