$PAR

a) Calculate the retarding force due to the viscosity of the air layer between a cart and a level air track given the following informationâ€”the air temperature is \(20^{\circ}\textrm{C}\), the cart is moving at \($v\) \(\textrm{m/s}\), its surface area is \($Aa \times 10^{-2}\) \(\textrm{m}^2\), and the thickness of the air layer is \($La \times 10^{-5}\) \(\textrm{m}\).

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the viscous drag force acting on a fluid undergoing laminar flow. You will have to research the viscosity of air at the given temperature.

b) What is the ratio of this force to the weight of the \($m\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) cart?
