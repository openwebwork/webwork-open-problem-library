<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Concrete is pumped from a cement mixer to the place it is being laid, instead of being
carried in wheelbarrows. The flow rate is \($QLmin\) \(\textrm{L/min}\) through a \($l\)-\(\textrm{m}\)-long, \($dcm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\) diameter hose, and the pressure at the pump is \($pressure \times 10^{6}  \textrm{N/m}^2\). 

$PAR

a) Calculate the resistance of the hose. 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the resistance exerted by a pipe on a fluid undergoing laminar flow.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$R"));

BEGIN_TEXT 

$PAR

b) What is the viscosity of the concrete, assuming the flow is laminar? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve for viscosity given your answer to part (a) above?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$n"));

BEGIN_TEXT 

$PAR

c) How much power is being supplied, assuming the point of use is at the same level as the pump? You may neglect the power supplied to increase the concrete's velocity.


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the power supplied to or generated by a moving fluid. The only power requirement in this example is that needed to maintain the pressure gradient.
