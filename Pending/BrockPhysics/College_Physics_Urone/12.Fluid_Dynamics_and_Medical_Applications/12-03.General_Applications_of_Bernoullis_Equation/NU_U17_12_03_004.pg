A sump pump (used to drain water from the basement of houses built below the water
table) is draining a flooded basement at the rate of \($QLs\) \(\textrm{L/s}\), with an output pressure of \($P1p \times 10^5\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\). 

$PAR

a) The water enters a hose with a \($d1\)-\(\textrm{cm}\) inside diameter and rises \($ha\) \(\textrm{m}\) above the pump. What is its pressure at this point? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the equation of continuity. Given that the cross-sectional area of the pipe does not change, what can be said about the kinetic energy of the fluid at its initial and final positions?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$P2a"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) The hose goes over the foundation wall, losing \(0.500\) \(\textrm{m}\) in height, and widens to \($d2\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter. What is the pressure now? You may neglect frictional losses in both parts of the problem.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the equation of continuity. The volume flow rate of an incompressible fluid is unchanged as it traverses a pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Can you solve for the initial and final velocities and then use these results in conjunction with Bernoulli's equation to determine the final pressure?
