Hoover Dam on the Colorado River is the highest dam in the United States at \(221\) \(\textrm{m}\), with an output of \(1300\) \(\textrm{MW}\). The dam generates electricity with water taken from a depth of \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\) and an average flow rate of \($Q\) \(\textrm{m}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\). 

$PAR

a) Calculate the power in this flow.
