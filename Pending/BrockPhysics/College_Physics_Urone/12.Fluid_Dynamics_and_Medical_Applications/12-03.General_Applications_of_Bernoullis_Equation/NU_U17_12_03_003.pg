$PAR

The left ventricle of a resting adult's heart pumps blood at a flow rate of \($Q\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\), increasing its pressure by \($PmmHg\) \(\textrm{mm Hg}\), its speed from zero to \($vcm\) \(\textrm{cm/s}\), and its height by \($hcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\). (All numbers are averaged over the entire heartbeat). Calculate the total power output of the left ventricle. Note that most of the power is used to increase blood pressure.
