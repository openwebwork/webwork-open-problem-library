$PAR

A frequently quoted rule of thumb in aircraft design is that wings should produce about \($P\) \(\textrm{N}\) of lift per square meter of wing. (The fact that a wing has a top and bottom surface does not double its area). 

$PAR

a) At takeoff, an aircraft travels at \($va\) \(\textrm{m/s}\), so that the air speed relative to the bottom of the wing is \($va\) \(\textrm{m/s}\). Taking the sea level density of air to be \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\), how fast must it move over the upper surface to create the ideal lift?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a moving fluid creates a region of low pressure. For the plane to take off, on which surface of its wings must the pressure be higher? Further recall that a pressure gradient results in a force exerted on the surface of an object.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$v2a"));

$PAR

b) How fast must air move over the upper surface at a cruising speed of \($vb\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) and at an altitude where air density is one-fourth that at sea level? 

$PAR

Note that this is not all of the aircraft's liftâ€”some comes from the body of the plane, some from engine thrust, and so on. Furthermore, Bernoulli's principle gives an approximate answer because flow over the wing creates turbulence.

BEGIN_HINT
Pay attention to the wording of the question - what is the air density at this new altitude?
