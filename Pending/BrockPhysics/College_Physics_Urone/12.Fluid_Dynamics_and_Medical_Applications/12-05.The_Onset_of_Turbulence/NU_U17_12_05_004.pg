$PAR

A fire hose has an inside diameter of \($dcmhose\) \(\textrm{cm}\). Suppose such a hose carries a flow of \($QLs\) \(\textrm{L/s}\) starting at a gauge pressure of \(1.62 \times 10^6 \textrm{N/m}^2\). The hose goes \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\) up a ladder to a nozzle having an inside diameter of \($dcmnozzle\) \(\textrm{cm}\). 

$PAR

a) Calculate the Reynolds numbers for flow in the fire hose to show that the flow must be turbulent.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} > 2000

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the Reynolds number. Can you use the equation of continuity to solve for the velocity in the hose?
END_HINT
