Gasoline is piped underground from refineries to major users. The flow rate is \(3.00 \times 10^{-2}\) \(\textrm{m}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\) (about \(500\) \(\textrm{gal/min}\)), the viscosity of gasoline is \(1.00 \times 10^{-3}\) \(\textrm{Pa}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s}\), and its density is \($p\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\).
 
$PAR

a) What minimum diameter must the pipe have if the Reynolds number is to be less than \(2000\)? 


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the Reynolds number. Can you use the equation of continuity to solve for the velocity in the pipe?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$d"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What pressure difference must be maintained along each kilometer of the pipe to maintain this flow rate?


$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa/km}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow. Can you use your result from part (a) to solve for the pressure difference?
