Verify that the flow of oil is laminar (barely) for an oil gusher that shoots crude oil
\($y\) \(\textrm{m}\) into the air through a pipe with a \($d\)-\(\textrm{m}\) diameter. The vertical pipe is \($l\) \(\textrm{m}\) long. Take the density of the oil to be \($p \textrm{kg/m}^3\) and its viscosity to be \(1.00\) \(\textrm{Pa}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s}\).
