$PAR

Assuming that blood is an ideal fluid, calculate the critical flow rate at which turbulence is a certainty in the aorta. Take the diameter of the aorta to be \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\). (Turbulence will actually occur at lower average flow rates, because blood is not an ideal fluid. Furthermore, since blood flow pulses, turbulence may occur during only the high-velocity part of each heartbeat).

BEGIN_HINT
Above what Reynolds number will the flow of blood be turbulent? This is not the same as that above which the blood flow will be unstable. You will have to research the viscosity and density of blood at body temperature.
