$PAR

Concrete is pumped from a cement mixer to the place it is being laid, instead of being
carried in wheelbarrows. The flow rate is \($QLmin\) \(\textrm{L/min}\) through a \($l\)-\(\textrm{m}\)-long, \($dcm\)-\(\textrm{cm}\) diameter hose, and the pressure at the pump is \($pressure \times 10^{6}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\). Verify that the flow of concrete is laminar taking concrete's viscosity to be \($n\) \(\textrm{Pa}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s}\), and given its density is \($density\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the Reynolds number. Can you use the equation of continuity to solve for the velocity in the hose?
