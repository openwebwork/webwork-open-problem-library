Unreasonable Results: A fairly large garden hose has an internal radius of \($rcm\) \(\textrm{m}\) and a length of \($l\) \(\textrm{m}\). The nozzleless horizontal hose is attached to a faucet, and it delivers \($QLs\) \(\textrm{L/s}\).

$PAR

a) What water pressure is supplied by the faucet? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Poiseuille's law for laminar flow. What gauge pressure exists at the end of the faucet exposed to the <i>atmosphere</i>?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$P2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the Reynolds number for the given flow? Take the viscosity of water as \(1.002 \times 10^{-3}\) \(\textrm{mPa}\) &middot; \(\textrm{s}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} >> 3000

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the Reynolds number. Can you use the equation of continuity to solve for the velocity in the hose?
