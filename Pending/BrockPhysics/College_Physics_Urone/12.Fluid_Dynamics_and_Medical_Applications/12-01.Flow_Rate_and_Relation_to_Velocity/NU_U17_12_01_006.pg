$PAR

A major artery with a cross-sectional area of \($A1\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\) branches into \($arteries\) smaller arteries, each with an average cross-sectional area of \($A2\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\). By what factor is the average velocity of the blood reduced when it passes into these branches?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the equation of continuity. The volume flow rate of an incompressible fluid is unchanged as it traverses a pipe of varying cross-sectional area.
