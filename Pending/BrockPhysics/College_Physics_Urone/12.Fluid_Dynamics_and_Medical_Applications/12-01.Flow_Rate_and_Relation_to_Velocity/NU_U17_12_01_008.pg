The human circulation system has approximately \(1.00 \times 10^9\) capillary vessels. Each vessel has a diameter of about \(8.0 \times 10^{-6}\) \(\textrm{m}\). Assuming cardiac output is \($Lmin\) \(\textrm{L/min}\), determine the average velocity of blood flow through each capillary vessel.

BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained? If so, then you could calculate the volume flow rate through <i>one</i> capillary.
