a) Estimate the time it would take to fill a private swimming pool with a capacity of \($V\) \(\textrm{L}\) using a garden hose delivering \($Qa\) \(\textrm{L/min}\).

$PAR

b) How long would it take to fill if you could divert a moderate size river, flowing at \($Qbm\) \(\textrm{m}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\), into it?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
For both (a) and (b), recall that volume flow rate is defined at the change in volume divided by the change in time.
