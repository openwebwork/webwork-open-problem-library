<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Unreasonable Results: A mountain stream is \($w\) \(\textrm{m}\) wide and averages \($l\) \(\textrm{m}\) in depth. During the spring runoff, the flow in the stream reaches \(100,000\) \(\textrm{m}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\). 

$PAR

What is the average velocity of the stream under these conditions?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained?
