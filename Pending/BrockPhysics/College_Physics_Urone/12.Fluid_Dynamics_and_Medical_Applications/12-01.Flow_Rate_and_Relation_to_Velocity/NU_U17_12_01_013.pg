$PAR

Water is moving at a velocity of \($v\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) through a hose with an internal diameter of \($d\) \(\textrm{cm}\). 

$PAR

a) What is the flow rate in litres per second? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{L/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) The fluid velocity in this hose's nozzle is \($v2\) \(\textrm{m/s}\). What is the nozzle's inside diameter?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the equation of continuity. The volume flow rate of an incompressible fluid is unchanged as it traverses a pipe of varying cross-sectional area.
