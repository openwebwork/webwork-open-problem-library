$PAR

a) As blood passes through the capillary bed in an organ, the capillaries join to form venules (small veins). If the blood speed increases by a factor of \($v\) and the total cross-sectional area of the venules is \($A2\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\), what is the total cross-sectional area of the capillaries feeding these venules?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the equation of continuity. The volume flow rate of an incompressible fluid is unchanged as it traverses a pipe of varying cross-sectional area.

b) How many capillaries are involved if their average diameter is \(10.0 \times 10^{-6}\) \(\textrm{m}\)?

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What is the cross-sectional area of one capillary? Given this result and your answer from part (a), can you solve for the number of capillaries?
