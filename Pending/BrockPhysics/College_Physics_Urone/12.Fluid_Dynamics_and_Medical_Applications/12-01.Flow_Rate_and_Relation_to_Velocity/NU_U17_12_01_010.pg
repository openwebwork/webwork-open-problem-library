<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

The flow rate of blood through a \($rad \times 10^{-6}\) \(\textrm{m}\) radius capillary is \($Qa \times 10^{-9}\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\).

$PAR

a) What is the speed of the blood flow? (This small speed allows time for diffusion of materials to and from the blood). 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$v"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Assuming all the blood in the body passes through capillaries, how many of them must there be to carry a total flow of \($totalflow\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\)? 
$PAR
(The large number obtained is an overestimate, but it is still reasonable).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} capillaries

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Given the total volume flow rate and the volume flow rate through a single capillary, can you solve for the number of capillaries?
