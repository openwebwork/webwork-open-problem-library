$PAR

The Huka Falls on the Waikato River is one of New Zealand's most visited natural tourist attractions. On average the river has a flow rate of about \($QLs1\times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{L/s}\). At the gorge, the river narrows to \($wa\) \(\textrm{m}\) wide and averages \($da\) \(\textrm{m}\) deep.

$PAR

a) What is the average speed of the river in the gorge? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the average speed of the water in the river downstream of the falls when it widens to \($wb\) \(\textrm{m}\) and its depth increases to an average of \($db\) \(\textrm{m}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For both (a) and (b), can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained?
