Blood is flowing through an artery of radius \($rmm\) \(\textrm{mm}\) at a rate of \($v\) \(\textrm{cm/s}\). 

$PAR

a) Determine the flow rate that passes through the artery in a period of \($t\) \(\textrm{s}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\)\(\textrm{/s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained?
