The main uptake air duct of a forced air gas heater is \($d\) \(\textrm{m}\) in diameter. What is the average speed of air in the duct if it carries a volume equal to that of the house's interior every \($min\) \(\textrm{min}\)? 
$PAR
The inside volume of the house is equivalent to a rectangular solid \($w\) \(\textrm{m}\) wide by \($l\) \(\textrm{m}\) long by \($h\) \(\textrm{m}\) high.

BEGIN_HINT
Can you think of an equation relating the volume flow rate of a fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which it is contained?
