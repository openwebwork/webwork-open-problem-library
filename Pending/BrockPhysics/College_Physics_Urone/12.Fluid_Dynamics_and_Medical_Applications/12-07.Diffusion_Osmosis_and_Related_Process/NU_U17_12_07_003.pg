$PAR

Oxygen reaches the veinless cornea of the eye by diffusing through its tear layer, which is \($xmm\) \(\textrm{mm}\) thick. How long does it take the average oxygen molecule to do this?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the root-mean-square distance between molecules undergoing diffusion. Can you solve for time?
