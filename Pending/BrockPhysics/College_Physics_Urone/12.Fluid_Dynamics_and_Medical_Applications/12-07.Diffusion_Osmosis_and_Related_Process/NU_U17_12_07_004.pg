<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) Find the average time required for an oxygen molecule to diffuse through a \($xmm\)-\(\textrm{mm}\)-thick tear layer on the cornea. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the root-mean-square distance between molecules undergoing diffusion. Can you solve for time?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$ta"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much time is required to diffuse \($V\) \(\textrm{cm}^3\) of oxygen to the cornea if its surface area is \($A\) \(\textrm{cm}^2\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the root-mean-square distance between molecules undergoing diffusion. Can you first solve for the average distance diffused, given the oxygen's volume and surface area?
