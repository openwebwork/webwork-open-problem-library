$PAR

Suppose hydrogen and oxygen are diffusing through air. A small amount of each is released simultaneously. How much time passes before the hydrogen is \(1.00\) \(\textrm{s}\) ahead of the oxygen? Such differences in arrival times are used as an analytical tool in gas chromatography.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the root-mean-square distance between molecules undergoing diffusion. Can you find and equate two equivalent expressions for the molecules' distance traveled, one in terms of the arrival time and diffusion constant of hydrogen and the other in terms of the parameters pertaining to oxygen?
