You can smell perfume very shortly after opening the bottle. To show that it is not
reaching your nose by diffusion, calculate the average distance a perfume molecule
moves in one second in air, given its diffusion constant \(D\) to be \(1.00 \times 10^{-6}\) \(\textrm{m}^2\)\(\textrm{/s}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the root-mean-square distance between molecules undergoing diffusion.
