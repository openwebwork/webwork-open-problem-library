$PAR
The length and width of a rectangular room are measured to be \(3.955 \pm 0.005\, \textrm{m}\) and \(3.050 \pm 0.005\, \textrm{m}\) . Calculate the area of the room and its uncertainty in square meters.

$PAR
Area = \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^2\)

$PAR
Uncertainty = \(\pm\)\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{m}^2\)
