BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
When non-metric units were used in the United Kingdom, a unit of mass called the pound-mass (lbm) was employed, where \(1\, \textrm{lbm} = 0.4539\, \textrm{kg}\).

$PAR
a) If there is an uncertainty of \($uncertainty \, \textrm{kg}\) in the pound-mass unit, what is its percent uncertainty?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR
b) Based on that percent uncertainty, what mass in pound-mass has an uncertainty of \(1\, \textrm{kg}\) when converted to kilograms?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{lbm}\)
