$PAR
An AM radio transmitter broadcasts \($power \, \(\textrm{kW}\) of power uniformly in all directions.
$PAR

a) Assuming all of the radio waves that strike the ground are completely absorbed, and that there is no absorption by the atmosphere or other objects, what is the intensity \($distance \, \(\textrm{km}\) away? (Hint: Half the power will be spread over the area of a hemisphere.)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) What is the maximum electric field strength at this distance?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V/m}\)

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that surface area of a <i>sphere</i> is \(4\)\(\pi\)\(\textrm{r}^2\)
