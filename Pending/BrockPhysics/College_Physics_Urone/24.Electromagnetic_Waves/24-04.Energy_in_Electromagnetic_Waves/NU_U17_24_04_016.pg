$BR
A \($turns\)-turn flat coil of wire \($diameter \, \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter acts as an antenna for FM radio at a frequency of \($frequency \, \(\textrm{MHz}\). The magnetic field of the incoming electromagnetic wave is perpendicular to the coil and has a maximum strength of \($strength\) \(\times 10^{-12} \, \(\textrm{T}\).
$PAR

a) What power is incident on the coil?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{-12}\) \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) What average emf is induced in the coil over one-fourth of a cycle?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
c) If the radio receiver has an inductance of \($inductance\) \(\mu\)\(\textrm{H}\), what capacitance must it have to resonate at \($frequency\) \(\textrm{MHz}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{-12}\) \(\textrm{F}\)
