<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Police radar determines the speed of motor vehicles using the same Doppler-shift technique employed for ultrasound in medical diagnostics. Beats are produced by mixing the double Doppler-shifted echo with the original frequency. If \($frequency_micro\) \(\times 10^{9} \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) microwaves are used and a beat frequency of \($frequency_beat \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) is produced, what is the speed of the vehicle? (Assume the same Doppler-shift formulas are valid with the speed of sound replaced by the speed of light.)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the speed of light is very large such that (\(\textrm{v/c}\))<sup>2</sup> is extremely small.
$PAR
You can choose the car to be coming or going, it will not make a difference in the final calculation.
