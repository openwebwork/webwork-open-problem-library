$PAR
Electromagnetic radiation from a \($laser \, \(\textrm{mW}\) laser is concentrated on a \($area \, \(\textrm{mm}^2\).
$PAR

a) What is the intensity in \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) Suppose a \($charge \, \(\textrm{nC}\) static charge is in the beam. What is the maximum electric force it experiences?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/C}\)

$PAR
