$PAR
Lasers can be constructed that produce an extremely high intensity electromagnetic wave for a brief timeâ€”called pulsed lasers. They are used to ignite nuclear fusion, for example. Such a laser may produce an electromagnetic wave with a maximum electric field strength of \($strength\) \(\times 10^{11} \, \(\textrm{V/m}\) for a time of \($time \, \(\textrm{ns}\).
$PAR

a) What is the maximum magnetic field strength in the wave?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{T}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) What is the intensity of the beam?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
c) What energy does it deliver on a \($area \, \(\textrm{mm}^2\) area?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$G"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the relationship of power and intensity, as well as energy and power. Use these relationships to create an expression in part (c).
