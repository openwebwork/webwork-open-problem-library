<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
If the Sun suddenly turned off, we would not know it until its light stopped coming. How long would that be, given that the Sun is \($distance\) \(\times 10^{11} \, \(\textrm{m}\) away?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the kinematics definition of speed.
