$PAR
The ideal size (most efficient) for a broadcast antenna with one end on the ground is one-fourth the wavelength (\(\lambda\)/ 4 ) of the electromagnetic radiation being sent out. If a new radio station has such an antenna that is \($distance \, \(\textrm{m}\) high.
$PAR

At what frequency does it broadcast most efficiently?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the height of the antenna given is only equal to 1/4\(\lambda\)
