$wavelength = random(190,195,1);

BEGIN_TEXT 
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) What is the frequency of the \($wavelength \, \(\textrm{nm}\) ultraviolet radiation used in laser eye surgery?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) Assuming the accuracy with which this EM radiation can ablate the cornea is directly proportional to wavelength, how much more accurate can this UV be than the shortest visible wavelength of light? (Which is \(380\) \(\textrm{nm}\)).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
How would you compare the two wavelengths? Keep in mind that part (b) is asking how much <i>more</i> accurate the former is.
