<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A radar used to detect the presence of aircraft receives a pulse that has reflected off an object \($time\) \(\times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{s}\) after it was transmitted. What is the distance from the radar station to the reflecting object?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Note the pulse is reflected, such that it traverses the distance twice.
