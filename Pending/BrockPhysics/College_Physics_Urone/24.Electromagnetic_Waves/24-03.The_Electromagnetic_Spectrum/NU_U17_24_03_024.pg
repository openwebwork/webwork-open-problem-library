$PAR
a) Calculate the rate in watts at which heat transfer through radiation occurs (almost entirely in the infrared) from \($distance \, \(\textrm{m}^2\) of the Earth's surface at night. Assume the emissivity is \($emissivity\), the temperature of the Earth is \($T_earth ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\), and that of outer space is \($T_space \, \(\textrm{K}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) Compare the intensity of this radiation with that coming to the Earth from the Sun during the day, which averages about \($radiation \, \(\textrm{W/m}^2\), only half of which is absorbed.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
c) What is the maximum magnetic field strength in the outgoing radiation, assuming it is a continuous wave?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\mu\)\(\textrm{T}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$G"));

BEGIN_HINT
Refer to OpenStax College Physics 24.4 to find the relationship between intensity and electric or magnetic field strengths.
