$PAR
Lunar astronauts placed a reflector on the Moon's surface, off which a laser beam is periodically reflected. The distance to the Moon is calculated from the round-trip time.
$PAR

a) To what accuracy in meters can the distance to the Moon be determined, if this time can be measured to \($time\) \(\textrm{ns}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) What percent accuracy is this, given the average distance to the Moon is \($distance\) \(\times 10^{8}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the time given is for the round trip.
