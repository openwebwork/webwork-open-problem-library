$PAR
Radar is used to determine distances to various objects by measuring the round-trip time for an echo from the object.
$PAR

a) How far away is the planet Venus if the echo time is \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
b) What is the echo time for a car \($distance_car \, \(\textrm{m}\) from a Highway Police radar unit? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\mu\)\(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
c) How accurately (in nanoseconds) must you be able to measure the echo time to an airplane \($distance_plane \, \(\textrm{km}\) away to determine its distance within \($range \, \(\textrm{m}\)? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{ns}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$G"));

BEGIN_HINT
For part (c), does the location of the plane affect the calculation for the accuracy of this range?
