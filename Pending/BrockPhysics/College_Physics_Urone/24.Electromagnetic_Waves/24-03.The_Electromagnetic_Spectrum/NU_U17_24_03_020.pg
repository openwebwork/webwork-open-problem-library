$PAR
Conversations with astronauts on lunar walks had an echo that was used to estimate the distance to the Moon. The sound spoken by the person on Earth was transformed into a radio signal sent to the Moon, and transformed back into sound on a speaker inside the astronaut's space suit. This sound was picked up by the microphone in the space suit (intended for the astronaut's voice) and sent back to Earth as a radio echo of sorts. If the round-trip time was \($time \, \(\textrm{s}\), what was the approximate distance to the Moon, neglecting any delays in the electronics?

Note the time given is the amount of time it takes to traverse the distance twice.
