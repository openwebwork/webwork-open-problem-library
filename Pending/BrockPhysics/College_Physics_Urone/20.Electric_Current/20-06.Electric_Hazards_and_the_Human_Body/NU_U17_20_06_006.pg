$PAR



During surgery, a current as small as \($A\) \(\mu\)\(\textrm{A}\) applied directly to the heart may cause ventricular fibrillation. If the resistance of the exposed heart is \($R \, \(\Omega\) , what is the smallest voltage that poses this danger?
$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Given the magnitude of resistance, would you expect a large or small voltage to produce such a current?
