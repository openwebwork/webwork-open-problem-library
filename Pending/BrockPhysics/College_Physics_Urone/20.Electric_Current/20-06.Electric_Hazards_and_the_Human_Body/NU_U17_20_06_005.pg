Foolishly trying to fish a burning piece of bread from a toaster with a metal butter knife, a man comes into contact with \($V \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC. He does not even feel it since, luckily, he is wearing rubber-soled shoes. What is the minimum resistance of the path the current follows through the person?
