$PAR



A heart defibrillator passes \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) through a patient's torso for \($t \, \(\textrm{ms}\) in an attempt to restore normal beating.
$PAR

a) How much charge passed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{C}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));


BEGIN_TEXT
b) What voltage was applied if \($J \, \(\textrm{J}\) of energy was dissipated?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kV}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What was the path's resistance?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{k}\)\(\Omega\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$G"));

BEGIN_TEXT
d) Find the temperature increase caused in the \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) of affected tissue.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$H"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that voltage is a form of potential energy. Return to its definition to help find energy in \(\textrm{J}\).
