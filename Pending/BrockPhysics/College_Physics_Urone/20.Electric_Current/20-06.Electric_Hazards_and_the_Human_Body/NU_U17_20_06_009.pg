A short circuit in a \($V \, \(\textrm{V}\) appliance cord has a \($R \, \(\Omega\) resistance. Calculate the temperature rise of the \($mass \, \(\textrm{g}\) of surrounding materials, assuming their specific heat capacity is \($heatc\) \(\textrm{cal/g}\) \(\cdot\) \(^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) and that it takes \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\) for a circuit breaker to interrupt the current.
