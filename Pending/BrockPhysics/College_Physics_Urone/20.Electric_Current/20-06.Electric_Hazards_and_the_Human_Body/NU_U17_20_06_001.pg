$PAR



a) How much power is dissipated in a short circuit of \($V \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC through a resistance of \($R \(\Omega\) ?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kW}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What current flows?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{A}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
A short circuit results when there is low resistance between two conductors. This causes an excessive flow of current, which could destroy the power source!
