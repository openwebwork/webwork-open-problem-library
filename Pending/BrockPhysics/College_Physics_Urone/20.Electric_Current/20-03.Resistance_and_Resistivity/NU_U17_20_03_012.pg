$PAR



A wire is drawn through a die, stretching it to \($T\) times its original length. By what factor does its resistance increase?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{R}\)<sub>i</sub>

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Use ratios to establish how a change in length affects radius of the wire.
