$PAR

Digital medical thermometers determine temperature by measuring the resistance of a semiconductor device called a thermistor (which has \(\alpha\) = \($a\) / \(^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) ) when it is at the same temperature as the patient. What is a patient's temperature if the thermistor's resistance at that temperature is \($P \, \(\textrm{%}\) of its value at \($T^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) (normal body temperature)?

BEGIN_HINT
If \(\textrm{R}\)<sub>2</sub> equals \(82\(\textrm{%}\) of \(\textrm{R}\)<sub>1</sub>, then what must \(\alpha\)\(\Delta\)\(\textrm{T}\) be equal to?
