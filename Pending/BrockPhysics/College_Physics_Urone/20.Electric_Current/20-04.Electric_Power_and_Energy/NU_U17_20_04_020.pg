$PAR



Cold vaporizers pass a current through water, evaporating it with only a small increase in temperature. One such home device is rated at \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) and utilizes \($V \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC with \($C\, \(\textrm{%}\) efficiency.
$PAR
a) What is the vaporization rate in grams per minute? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g/min}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How much water must you put into the vaporizer for \($T \, \(\textrm{h}\) of overnight operation?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{L}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) Recall the definition of power. Use this information to establish a relationship between heat and power.
$PAR
b) Remember that for water, \(1 \, \(\textrm{g}\) = \(1 \, \(\textrm{mL}\)
