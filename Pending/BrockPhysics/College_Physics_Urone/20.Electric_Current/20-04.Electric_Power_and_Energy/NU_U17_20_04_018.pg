$PAR



An old lightbulb draws only \($Wa \, \(\textrm{W}\), rather than its original \($Wb \, \(\textrm{W}\), due to evaporative thinning of its filament. By what factor is its diameter reduced, assuming uniform thinning along its length? Neglect any effects caused by temperature differences.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\) reduction in the diameter of the filament

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Begin by creating a ratio that allows you to divide out any unknowns.
