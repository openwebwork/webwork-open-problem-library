$PAR



What would be the maximum cost of a CFL such that the total cost (investment plus operating) would be the same for both CFL and incandescent \($W \, \(\textrm{W}\) bulbs? Assume the cost of the incandescent bulb is \($P \, \(\textrm{cents}\) and that electricity costs \($Ph \, \(\textrm{cents/kWh}\) . Calculate the cost for \($T \, \(\textrm{hours}\), as in the cost effectiveness of CFL example.

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to include the cost of the lightbulb itself.
