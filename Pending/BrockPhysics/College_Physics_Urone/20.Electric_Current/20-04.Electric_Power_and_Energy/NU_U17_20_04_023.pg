$PAR

How much time is needed for a surgical cauterizer to raise the temperature of \($Ma \, \(\textrm{g}\) of tissue from \($Ta^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) to \($Tb^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) and then boil away \($Mb \, \(\textrm{g}\) of water, if it puts out \($A \, \(\textrm{mA}\) at \($V \, \(\textrm{kV}\)? Ignore heat transfer to the surroundings.
