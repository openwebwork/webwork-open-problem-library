a) What is the cost of heating a hot tub containing \($masswater \, \(\textrm{kg}\) of water from \($T1^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) to \($T2^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\), assuming \($eff \, \(\textrm{%}\) efficiency to account for heat transfer to the surroundings? The cost of electricity is \($cost \, \(\textrm{cents/kWh}\).
