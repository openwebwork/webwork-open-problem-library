a) What energy is dissipated by a lightning bolt having a \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) current, a voltage of \($V\) \(\times 10^{2} \, \(\textrm{MV}\) , and a length of \($T \, \(\textrm{ms}\)?

b) What mass of tree sap could be raised from \($t^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) to its boiling point and then evaporated by this energy, assuming sap has the same thermal characteristics as water?

BEGIN_HINT
Consider all processes regarding thermal energy which are required to raise the tree sap to its boiling point.
