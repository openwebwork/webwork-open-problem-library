$PAR



Find the power dissipated in each of these extension cords:
$PAR

a) an extension cord having a \($Ra\ \, \(\Omega\) resistance and through which \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) is flowing.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) a cheaper cord utilizing thinner wire and with a resistance of \($Rb \, \(\Omega\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Have you tried finding the voltage?
