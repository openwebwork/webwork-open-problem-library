$PAR



Electron guns are used in X-ray tubes. The electrons are accelerated through a relatively large voltage and directed onto a metal target, producing X-rays.
$PAR

a) How many electrons per second strike the target if the current is \($A \, \(\textrm{mA}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{electrons/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What charge strikes the target in \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{C}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
How many electrons are there per one Coulomb?
