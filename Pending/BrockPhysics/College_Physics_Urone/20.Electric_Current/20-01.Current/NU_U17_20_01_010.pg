$PAR



A clock battery wears out after moving \($C \, \(\textrm{C}\) of charge through the clock at a rate of \($A \, \(\textrm{mA}\).
$PAR

a) How long did the clock run?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How many electrons per second flowed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{electrons/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
How many electrons are needed to yield a charge equivalent to that given in the question?
END_HINT
