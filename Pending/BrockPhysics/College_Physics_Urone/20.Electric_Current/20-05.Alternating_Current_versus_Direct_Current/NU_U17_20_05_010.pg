$PAR



Two different electrical devices have the same power consumption, but one is meant to be operated on \($V1 \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC and the other on \($V2 \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC.
$PAR

a) What is the ratio of their resistances?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

b) What is the ratio of their currents?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) Assuming its resistance is unaffected, by what factor will the power increase if a \($V1 \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC device is connected to \($V2 \, \(\textrm{V}\) AC?
