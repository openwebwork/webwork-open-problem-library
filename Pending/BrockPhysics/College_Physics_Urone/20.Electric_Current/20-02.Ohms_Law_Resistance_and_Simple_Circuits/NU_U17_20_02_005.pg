<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) Find the voltage drop in an extension cord having a \($Ra\) \(\Omega\) resistance and through which \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) is flowing.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) A cheaper cord utilizes thinner wire and has a resistance of \($Rb\) \(\Omega\) . What is the voltage drop in it when \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) flows?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of voltage. Why would a voltage drop be considered undesirable (in most situations?
