<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What is the effective resistance of a car's starter motor when \($A \, \(\textrm{A}\) flows through it as the car battery applies \($V \, \(\textrm{V}\) to the motor?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\Omega\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Considering the magnitude of current, would you expect the magnitude of the resistance to be large or small?
