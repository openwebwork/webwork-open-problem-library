a) During laser vision correction, a brief burst of \(193\) nm ultraviolet light is projected onto the cornea of the patient. It makes a spot \($dmm\) mm in diameter and deposits \($QmJ\) mJ of energy. Calculate the depth of the layer ablated, assuming the corneal tissue has the same properties as water and is initially at \($T1C ^{\circ}C\). The tissue's temperature is increased to \($T2C ^{\circ}C\) and evaporated without further temperature increase.
