a) Where does an object need to be placed relative to a microscope for its \($objective_focal_length\) \(\textrm{cm}\) focal length objective to produce a magnification of \($objective_magnification\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you solve, simultaneously, for the distance from the objective lens to the object, the thin lens equation and one of the formul&#230; for magnification?

b) How far behind the objective lens should the \($eyepiece_focal_length\) \(\textrm{cm}\) focal length eyepiece be placed to produce a further \($eyepiece_magnification \times\) magnification?

BEGIN_HINT
Take a look at the figure above. The spacing between lenses can be expressed in terms of
$PAR
<b>i.</b>  The distance from the objective lens to the first image, and,
$PAR
<b>ii.</b> The distance from the eyepiece to the first image.
$PAR
If you substitute your result from part (a) back into the thin lens equation, you should be able to solve for (i). Now, can you find (ii)?
