A young woman with normal distant vision has a \($ratio\)\(\textrm{%}\) ability to accommodate (that
is, increase) the power of her eyes. What is the closest object she can see clearly? The woman's eyes have a lens-to-retina distance of \($image_distance\) \(\textrm{cm}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Can you first determine the woman's focal power when her eyes are fully relaxed, taking the distance to the object to be infinity for distant vision?
