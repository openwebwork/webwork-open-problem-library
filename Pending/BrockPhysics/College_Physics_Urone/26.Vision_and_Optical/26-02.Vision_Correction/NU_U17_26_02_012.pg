A very myopic man has a far point of \($far_point\) \(\textrm{cm}\). What power of spectacle lens, held \($glasses_distance\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from his eyes, will correct his distant vision?

To correct the man's myopia, the spectacle lens should create the image of a very distant object at his far point.
