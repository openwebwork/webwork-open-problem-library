A severely myopic patient has a far point of \($initial_far_point\) \(\textrm{cm}\). By how many diopters should the power of his eye be reduced in laser vision correction to obtain normal distant vision? The patient has a lens-to-retina distance of \($image_distance\) \(\textrm{cm}\).

BEGIN_HINT
What is the is the patient's actual focal power when their eyes are fully relaxed? What should therein be their focal power, taking the distance to the object to be infinity for distant vision?
