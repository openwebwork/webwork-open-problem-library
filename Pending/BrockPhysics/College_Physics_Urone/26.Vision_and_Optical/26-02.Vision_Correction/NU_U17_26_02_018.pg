A college student sports \($focal_power\) \(\textrm{D}\) glasses \($glasses_distance\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from her eyes. What is her near point?

BEGIN_HINT 
It might help you to draw a diagram. To correct the student's hyperopia, the spectacle lens should create the image of an object held at \(25\) \(\textrm{cm}\)  at her near point. Can you express the distance from the lens to the image in terms of the near point/known variables?
