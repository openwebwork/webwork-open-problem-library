The print in many books averages \($object_height\) \(\textrm{mm}\) in height. How high is the image of the print on the retina when the book is held \($object_distance\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from the eye, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of \($image_distance\) \(\textrm{cm}\)?

Can you equate the two formul&#230; for magnification and rearrange this new expression to solve for the height of the image?
