$PAR
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) How high a hill can a car coast up (engine disengaged) if work done by friction is
negligible and its initial speed is \($vokmh\, \textrm{km/h}\)? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$ha"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) If, in actuality, a \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) car with an initial speed of \($vokmh\, \textrm{km/h}\) is observed to coast up a hill to a height \($h\, \textrm{m}\) above its starting point, how much thermal energy was generated by friction? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ef"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) What is the average force of friction if the hill has a slope \($degree ^{\circ}\) above the horizontal?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider using the principle of conservation of energy.
$PAR
Parts b) and c) relate to the energy dissipated due to friction. Consider using the principle of conservation of energy or the work-energy principle.
