$PAR
A \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) skier with an initial speed of \($vo\, \textrm{m/s}\) coasts up a straight slope. The slope makes an angle of \($degree^{\circ}\) relative to the horizontal, and once the skier reaches the top of the slope her altitude is \($h\, \textrm{m}\) higher than it was at ground level. Find her final speed at the top, given that the coefficient of friction between her skis and the snow is \(0.0800\).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$vf"));

BEGIN_HINT
Once she reaches the top of the hill, the skier has kinetic and gravitational potential energy. When she was at the bottom of the hill she had kinetic energy. The total mechanical energy at the top of the hill is not equal to the total mechanical energy at the bottom of the hill because some energy is dissipated due to the friction between her skis and the snow.
