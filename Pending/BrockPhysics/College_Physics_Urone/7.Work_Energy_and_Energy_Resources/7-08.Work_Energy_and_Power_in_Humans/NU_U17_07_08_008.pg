$PAR
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Shoveling snow can be extremely taxing because the arms have such a low efficiency in this activity (3%). Suppose a person shoveling a footpath metabolizes food at the rate of \($Pin\, \textrm{W}\). 
$PAR
a) What is her useful power output? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Pouta"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) How long will it take her to lift \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) of snow \($h\, \textrm{m}\)? (This could be the amount of heavy snow on \(20\, \textrm{m}\) of footpath.) 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$t"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) How much waste heat transfer will she dissipate in the process?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ewaste"));

BEGIN_HINT
Is the length of the path needed to find the time it will take for her to shovel it?
