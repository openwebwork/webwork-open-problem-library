<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) Calculate the energy used by a \($m\textrm{-kg}\) woman who does \($N\) deep knee bends in which her centre of mass is lowered and raised \($h\, \textrm{m}\). You may assume her efficiency is \($percent\)%.
