Mountain climbers carry bottled oxygen when at very high altitudes. 
$PAR
a) Assuming that a mountain climber uses oxygen at \(3.92\, \textrm{L/min}\) (equivalent to \(1370\, \textrm{W}\)), calculate how many litres of oxygen a climber would need for \($hour\, \textrm{h}\) of climbing. (These are litres at sea level.) 
$PAR
Note that only \($percent\)% of the inhaled oxygen is utilized; the rest is exhaled.

b) How much useful work does the climber do if he and his equipment have a mass of \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) and he gains \($h\, \textrm{m}\) of altitude?
