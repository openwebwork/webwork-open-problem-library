<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A swimmer exerts an average horizontal backward force of \($F\, \textrm{N}\) with his arm during each \($d\, \textrm{m}\) long stroke. 
$PAR
a) What is his work output in each stroke? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$W"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) Calculate the power output of his arms if he does \($strokes\) strokes per minute.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$P"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the force of the swimmer's stroke indicated in the question is the average horizontal backward force. This means that the force is in the same line as the motion.
