<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Jogging on hard surfaces with insufficiently padded shoes produces large forces in the feet and legs. 
$PAR
a) Calculate the force needed to stop the downward motion of a jogger's leg, if his leg has a mass of \($ml\, \textrm{kg}\), a speed of \($v\, \textrm{m/s}\), and stops in a distance of \($dcm\, \textrm{cm}\). (Be certain to include the weight of the \($mj\textrm{-kg}\) jogger's body.)

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fnet"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) Determine the ratio of this force to the weight of the jogger. 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} 

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Force"));

BEGIN_HINT
The force exerted on the jogger's leg must support the weight of the jogger's entire body and also provide the acceleration to stop the leg.
