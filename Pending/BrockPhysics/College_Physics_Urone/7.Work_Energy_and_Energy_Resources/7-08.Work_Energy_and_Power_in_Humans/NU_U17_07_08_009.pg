<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Very large forces are produced in joints when a person jumps from some height to the ground. 
$PAR
a) Calculate the force exerted if a \($m\textrm{-kg}\) person jumps from a \($h\textrm{-m}\) high ledge and lands stiffly, compressing joint material \($dcm\, \textrm{cm}\) as a result. (Be certain to include the weight of the person.) 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fa"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) In practice the knees bend almost involuntarily to help extend the distance over which you stop. Calculate the force exerted if the stopping distance is \($db\, \textrm{m}\). 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fb"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) Determine the ratio of the force exerted with stiff legs to the weight of the person.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} 

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fneta"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
d) Determine the ratio of the force with bent legs to the weight of the person.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} 

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fnetb"));

BEGIN_HINT
The force on the person's joints has two sources, one due to supporting the weight of the person and one due to slowing and stopping the person.
