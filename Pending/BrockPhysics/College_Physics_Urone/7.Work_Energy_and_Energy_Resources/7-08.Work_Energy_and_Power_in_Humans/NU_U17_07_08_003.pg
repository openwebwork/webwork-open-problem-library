<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Calculate the power output in watts of a shot-putter who takes \($t\, \textrm{s}\) to accelerate the \($m\textrm{-kg}\) shot from rest to \($v\, \textrm{m/s}\), while raising it \($h\, \textrm{m}\). (Do not include the power produced to accelerate his body.)

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$P"));

BEGIN_HINT
One way to solve the problem is to first use the work-energy principle to determine the work done by the shot-putter. Then use kinematics to determine the time needed for the motion. Finally use this information to determine the power.
