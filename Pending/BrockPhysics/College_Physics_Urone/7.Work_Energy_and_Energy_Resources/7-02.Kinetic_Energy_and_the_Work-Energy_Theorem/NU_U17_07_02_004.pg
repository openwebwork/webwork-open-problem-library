<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) Calculate the magnitude of the force needed to bring a \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) car to rest from a speed of \($vkmh\, \textrm{km/h}\) in a distance of \($da\, \textrm{m}\) (a fairly typical distance for a non-panic stop).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fa"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) Suppose instead the car hits a concrete abutment at full speed and is brought to a stop in \($db\, \textrm{m}\). 
$PAR
Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted on the car and compare it with the force found in part (a).

$PAR
Second force = \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)
$PAR
Ratio of second force to first force = \{ans_rule(40)\}

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fb"));
ANS(num_cmp("$Fba"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) This problem can be solved by rearranging one of the fundamental kinematics equations.
$PAR
b) Using the same equation you used in part (a), you can find the second force. It's interesting to compare the force ratio to the ratio of the stopping distances.
