$PAR
Boxing gloves are padded to lessen the force of a blow. 
$PAR
a) Calculate the force exerted by a boxing glove on an opponent's face, if the glove and face compress \($dacm\, \textrm{cm}\) during a blow in which the \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) arm and glove are brought to rest from an initial speed of \($v\, \textrm{m/s}\). 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fa"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) Calculate the force exerted by an identical blow in the gory old days when no gloves were used and the knuckles and face would compress only \($dbcm\, \textrm{cm}\). 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Fb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Both parts of this problem can be solved either by using the work-energy principle, or by using kinematics. Try it both ways and compare the solution processes for deeper understanding.
