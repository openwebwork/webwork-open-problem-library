$PAR
A car's bumper is designed to withstand a \(4.0\, \textrm{km/h}\) (\(1.12\, \textrm{m/s}\)) collision with an immovable object without damage to the body of the car. The bumper cushions the shock by absorbing the force over a distance that is greater than it would be without the bumper. Calculate the magnitude of the average force on a bumper that collapses \($d\, \textrm{m}\) while bringing a \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) car to rest from an initial speed of \(1.12\, \textrm{m/s}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Determine the magnitude of the acceleration as the car stops; then connect the acceleration to the force.
