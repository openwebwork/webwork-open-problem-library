<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
The final speed of a roller coaster that has descended \($h\, \textrm{m}\) is only slightly greater when it has an initial speed of \($v\, \textrm{m/s}\) than when it starts from rest. This implies that \(\Delta \textrm{PE} >> \textrm{KE}_i\) for the roller coaster's motion. Confirm this statement by determining the ratio of \(\Delta \textrm{PE}\) to \(\textrm{KE}_i\).

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PEKEi"));

BEGIN_HINT
Note that the mass of the roller coaster cancels, and is therefore irrelevant.
