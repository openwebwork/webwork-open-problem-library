$PAR
A hydroelectric power facility converts the gravitational potential energy of water behind a dam to electric energy. 
$PAR
a) What is the gravitational potential energy relative to the generators of a lake of volume \(50.0\, \textrm{km}^3\) (mass \(5.00 \times 10^{13}\, \textrm{kg}\)), given that the lake has an average height of \($h\, \textrm{m}\) above the generators? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PE"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
$PAR
b) Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy stored in a 9-megaton fusion bomb (\(3.8 \times 10^{16}\, \textrm{J}\)).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} 

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Elb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Pretend that the water behind the dam is all at the average height above the generator, which will help you to calculate its potential energy.
