<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose a \($mbg\, \textrm{g}\) kookaburra (a large kingfisher bird) picks up a \($mag\, \textrm{g}\) snake and raises it \($h\, \textrm{m}\) from the ground to a branch. 
$PAR
a) How much work did the bird do on the snake?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PEa"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
$PAR
b) How much work did the bird do to raise its own centre of mass to the branch?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PEb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Assume that the bird and snake move upwards at a constant speed. What does this tell you about the net force exerted on the snake and the bird? How can you use this conclusion to determine the work?
