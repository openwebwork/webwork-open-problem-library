<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) How much gravitational potential energy (relative to the ground on which it is
built) is stored in the Great Pyramid of Cheops, given that its mass is about \(7.00 \times 10^{9}\, \textrm{kg}\) and its centre of mass is \($h\, \textrm{m}\) above the surrounding ground? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PE"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
$PAR
b) Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy equivalent of the daily food intake of a person. (\(1.2 \times 10^{7}\, \textrm{J}\)).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} 

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Epf"));

BEGIN_HINT
Pretend that all of the mass of the pyramid is concentrated at its centre of mass, which will help you to calculate its potential energy.
