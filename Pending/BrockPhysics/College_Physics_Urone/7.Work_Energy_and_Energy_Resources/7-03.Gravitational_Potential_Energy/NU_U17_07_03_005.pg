<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A \($mg\, \textrm{g}\) toy car is propelled by a compressed spring that starts it moving. The car follows a curved track. What is the final speed if its initial speed is \($vo\, \textrm{m/s}\) and it coasts up the frictionless slope, gaining \($h\, \textrm{m}\) in altitude?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)
