In a downhill ski race, little advantage is gained by getting a running start. (This is because the initial kinetic energy is small compared with the gain in gravitational potential energy on even small hills.) To demonstrate this, find the final speed and the time taken for a skier who skies \($L\, \textrm{m}\) along a \($degree^{\circ}\) slope neglecting friction, using the following steps.
$PAR
a) Determine the final speed, starting from rest. 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$vf"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
$PAR
b) Determine the total time, starting from rest. 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$tr"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
$PAR
c) Determine the final speed, starting with an initial speed of \($vo\, \textrm{m/s}\). 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$vv"));


BEGIN_TEXT 
$PAR
d) Determine the total time, starting with an initial speed of \($vo\, \textrm{m/s}\). 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

Once you have obtained all of the results, it's worth reflecting on the difference in times based on the initial speeds. The difference is sufficiently small that it's not very significant in recreational skiing, but it might make a significant difference in a professional race.

BEGIN_HINT
Rearrange one of the kinematics equations to find the total time taken for the skier to reach the bottom.
