<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Unreasonable Results.  Body fat is metabolized, supplying \($kJg\, \textrm{kJ/g}\), when dietary intake is less than needed to fuel metabolism. The manufacturers of an exercise bicycle claim that you can lose \($mkg\, \textrm{kg}\) of fat per day by vigorously exercising for \($hour\, \textrm{h}\) per day on their machine. 
$PAR
a) How many \(\textrm{kJ}\) are supplied by the metabolization of \($mkg\, \textrm{kg}\) of fat?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$kJ"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) Calculate the \(\textrm{kJ/min}\) that you would have to utilize to metabolize fat at the rate of \($mkg\, \textrm{kg}\) in \($hour\, \textrm{h}\).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kJ}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$kJmin"));

BEGIN_HINT
If you are stuck, take a close look at the units of the given information. Consider how to combine the given information to cancel units to obtain the desired quantities.
