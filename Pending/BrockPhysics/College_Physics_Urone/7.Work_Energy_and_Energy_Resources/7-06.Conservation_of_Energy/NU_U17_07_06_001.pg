BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Knowing that \(10^{-19}\, \textrm{J}\) are required to break one molecule of DNA and that a single electron emitted by a TV tube carries \(4.0 \times 10^{-15}\, \textrm{J}\), how many DNA molecules could be broken by the energy carried by a single electron in the beam of an old-fashioned TV tube? (These electrons were not dangerous in themselves, but they did create dangerous X-rays. Later model tube TVs had shielding that absorbed X-rays before they escaped and exposed viewers.)

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} molecules
