$PAR
If the energy in fusion bombs were used to supply the energy needs of the world, how many of the 9-megaton variety would be needed for a year's supply of energy, given that annual world energy use is \(4 \times 10^{20}\, \textrm{J}\) and that a 9-megaton fusion bomb releases \(3.8 \times 10^{16}\, \textrm{J}\)? This is not as far-fetched as it may soundâ€”there are thousands of nuclear bombs, and their energy can be trapped in underground explosions and converted to electricity, as natural geothermal energy is.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} bombs
