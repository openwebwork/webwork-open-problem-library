$PAR
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Calculate the work done by a \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) man who pushes a crate \($d\, \textrm{m}\) up along a ramp that makes an angle of \($degree^\circ\) with the horizontal. He exerts a force of \($F\, \textrm{N}\) on the crate parallel to the ramp and moves at a constant speed. 
$PAR
Be certain to include the work he does on the crate and on his body to get up the ramp.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$W"));

BEGIN_HINT
The force he exerts on the crate is given, but you must calculate the force he exerts on his body to get up the ramp and add them together to find the total force.
