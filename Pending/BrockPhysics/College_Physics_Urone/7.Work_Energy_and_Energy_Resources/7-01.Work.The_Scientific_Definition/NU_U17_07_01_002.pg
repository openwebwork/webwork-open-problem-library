$PAR
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A \($m\, \(\textrm{kg}\) person climbs stairs, gaining \($h \, \(\textrm{m}\) in height. 
$PAR
Find the work done to accomplish this task.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$W")); 

BEGIN_HINT
This question is only concerned with work done to move the person in the upward direction. The person exerts a force against gravity to reach the top of the stairs.
