$PAR
Suppose a car travels \($km\, \textrm{km}\) at a speed of \($v\, \textrm{m/s}\), and uses \($gal\, \textrm{gal}\) of gasoline. Only \($percent\,  \textrm{%}\) of the gasoline goes into useful work by the force that keeps the car moving at constant speed despite friction. (The energy content of gasoline is \(1.2 \times 10^8\, \textrm{J/gal}\).)
$PAR
a) What is the force exerted to keep the car moving at constant speed?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{N}\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ff"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) If the required force is directly proportional to speed, how many gallons of gasoline will be used to drive \($km\, \textrm{km}\) at a speed of \($v1\, \textrm{m/s}\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{gal}\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$gallons"));

BEGIN_HINT
$PAR
a) How much useful energy comes from the amount of gasoline the car uses over this distance?
$PAR
b) This question can be solved by finding and using the number of gallons of gasoline used per meter per second to complete your calculation.
