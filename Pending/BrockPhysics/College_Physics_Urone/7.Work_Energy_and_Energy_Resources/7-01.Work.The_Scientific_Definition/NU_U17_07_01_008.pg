$PAR
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose the ski patrol lowers a rescue sled and victim, having a total mass of \($m\, \textrm{kg}\), down a \($degree^{\circ}\) slope at constant speed, as shown above. The coefficient of friction between the sled and the snow is \($us\). 
$PAR
a) How much work is done by friction as the sled moves \($d\, \textrm{m}\) along the hill? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wf"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) How much work is done by the rope on the sled in this distance? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wr"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) What is the work done by the gravitational force on the sled? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wg"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
d) What is the total work done?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \( \textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$W"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider finding the vertical distance the sled and victim are lowered in order to find the work done to lower them.
