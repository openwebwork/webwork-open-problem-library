<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
How much work does a supermarket checkout attendant do on a can of soup he pushes \($d \, \textrm{m}\) horizontally with a force of \($F\, \textrm{N}\)? 
$PAR
Express your answer in joules.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$W"));


BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Express your answer in kilocalories.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kcal}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wkcal"));

BEGIN_HINT
The can is pushed horizontally and moves in the direction of the force. How does this information help you calculate the work done by the force exerted by the cashier on the can?
