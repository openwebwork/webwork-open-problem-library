<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) Calculate the work done on a \($m\, \(\textrm{kg}\) elevator compartment by its cable to lift it \($h\, \(\textrm{m}\) at constant speed, assuming friction averages \($F\, \(\textrm{N}\). 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wc"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) What is the work done on the elevator compartment by the gravitational force in this process? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wg"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
c) What is the total work done on the elevator compartment?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Wt"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) The elevator compartment is moving at a constant speed; what can you conclude about the net force acting on the elevator compartment? What does that tell you about the force exerted by the cable on the elevator compartment?
$PAR
b) The force exerted by gravity is in the downward direction, while the motion of the elevator compartment is in the upward direction. What does this tell you about the sign of the work done by gravity on the elevator compartment?
$PAR
c) Remember that the net force on the elevator compartment is zero.
