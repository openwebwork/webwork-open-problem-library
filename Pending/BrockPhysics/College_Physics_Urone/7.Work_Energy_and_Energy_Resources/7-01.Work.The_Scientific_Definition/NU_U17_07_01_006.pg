$PAR

How much work is done by the boy pulling his sister \(30\, \textrm{m}\) in a wagon as shown? Assume no friction acts on the wagon.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$W"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to consider the angle between the direction of the force the boy applies to the wagon and the direction of the wagon's motion.
END_HINT
