$PAR
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) What is the average useful power output of a person who does \($Wa \times 10^{6}\, \textrm{J}\) of useful work in \($hour\, \textrm{h}\)? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$P"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) Working at this rate, how long will it take this person to lift \($m\, \textrm{kg}\) of bricks \($h\, \textrm{m}\) to a platform? (Work done to lift his body can be omitted because it is not considered useful output here.)

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$tb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the work done by the person moving the bricks is equal to the gravitational potential energy that the bricks gain.
