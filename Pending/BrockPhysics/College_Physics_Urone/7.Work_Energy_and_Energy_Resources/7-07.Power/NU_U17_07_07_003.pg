<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A person in good physical condition can deliver \($Po\, \textrm{W}\) of useful power for several hours at a stretch, perhaps by pedalling a mechanism that drives an electric generator. Neglect any losses due to generator inefficiency and practical considerations such as resting time. 
$PAR
a) How many people would it take to run a \($PakW\, \textrm{-kW}\) electric clothes dryer?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} people

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PaPo"));


BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) How many people would it take to replace a large electric power plant that generates \($PbMW\, \textrm{MW}\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} people

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PbPo"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to convert all measurements to the same units!
