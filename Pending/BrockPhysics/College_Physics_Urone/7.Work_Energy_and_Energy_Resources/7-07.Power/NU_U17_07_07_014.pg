<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) Calculate the power per square meter reaching Earth's upper atmosphere from the Sun. (Take the power output of the Sun to be \(4.00 \times 10^{26}\, \textrm{W}\) and the distance from the Sun to the Earth is \(1.5\times10^{11}\, \textrm{m}\)).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$PA"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Part of this is absorbed and reflected by the atmosphere, so that a maximum of \(1.30\, \textrm{kW/m}^2\) reaches Earth's surface. Calculate the area of solar energy collectors needed to replace an electric power plant that generates \(750\, \textrm{MW}\) if the collectors convert an average of \(2.00\,\textrm{%}\) of the maximum power into electricity. (This small conversion efficiency is due to the devices themselves, and the fact that the sun is directly overhead only briefly.)

ANS(num_cmp("$Ab"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
b) With the same assumptions, what area would be needed to meet the United States' energy needs \(1.05 \times 10^{20}\, \textrm{J/y}\)? 

$PAR

$PAR
c) Australia's energy needs \(5.4 \times 10^{26}\, \textrm{J/y}\)? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^2\)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ad"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
d) China's energy needs \(6.3 \times 10^{26}\, \textrm{J/y}\)?

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ae"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the power radiated outward by the sun spreads out into a sphere. Not all of it reaches the Earth.
