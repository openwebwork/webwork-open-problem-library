<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A \($m\, \textrm{-kg}\) dragster accelerates from rest to a final speed of \($v\, \textrm{m/s}\) in \($d\, \textrm{m}\) and encounters an average frictional force of \($f\, \textrm{N}\). What is its average power output in watts if this takes \($t\, \textrm{s}\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W}\)

END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
What is its average power output in horsepower? (Note that 1 hp = 746 W.)

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{hp}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Php"));

BEGIN_HINT
Note that the energy delivered by the car's engine includes the kinetic energy of the car as well as the work it does against the force of friction.
