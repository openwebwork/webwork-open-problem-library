<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

How much energy must the shock absorbers of a \($mass\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) car dissipate in order to damp a bounce that initially has a velocity of \($speed\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) at the equilibrium position? Assume the car returns to its original vertical position.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Pay attention to the wording - of what fraction of the total mechanical energy does kinetic energy consist when the oscillator is at its equilibrium position?
