<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

a) How much will a spring that has a force constant of \($force\) \(\textrm{N/m}\) be stretched by an object with a mass of \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) when hung motionless from the spring?

$PAR

Spring is Stretched \{ans_rule(30)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
The hanging object will have extended the spring by its equilibrium distance (that is, it will hang motionless) when the object's weight and the spring force balance.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Calculate the decrease in gravitational potential energy of the \($mass\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) object when it descends this distance.

$PAR

\(-\) \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Take the equilibrium distance to be the level of zero gravitational potential energy.
END_HINT
