<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Two tuning forks having frequencies of \($freq\) \(\textrm{Hz}\) and \($freq2\) \(\textrm{Hz}\) are struck simultaneously. What average frequency will you hear, and what will the beat frequency be?

$PAR

Average Frequency = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
Beat Frequency = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall beat frequency is defined as the difference in frequency between two similar-frequency waves.
