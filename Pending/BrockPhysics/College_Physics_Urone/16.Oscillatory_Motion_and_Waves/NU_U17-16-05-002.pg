Engineering Application: Near the top of the Citigroup Center building in New York City, there is an object with mass of \(4.00 \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{kg}\) on springs that have adjustable force constants. Its function is to dampen wind-driven oscillations of the building by oscillating at the same frequency as the building is being drivenâ€”the driving force is transferred to the object, which oscillates instead of the entire building.

$PAR

a)  Which effective stiffness constant should the springs have to make the object oscillate with a period of \($period\) \(\textrm{s}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the period of a simple harmonic oscillator to its mass and spring constant.
END_HINT

$PAR

b) How much energy is stored in the springs for a \($length\)-\(\textrm{m}\) displacement from equilibrium?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for elastic potential energy and make use of your result from part (a).
