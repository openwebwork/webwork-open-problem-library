$PAR

Your ear is capable of differentiating sounds that arrive at the ear just \(1.00\) \(\textrm{ms}\) apart. What is the minimum distance between two speakers that produce sounds that arrive at noticeably different times on a day when the speed of sound is \(340\) \(\textrm{m/s}\)? Ignore interference.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall speed is defined as the change in distance over the change in time.
