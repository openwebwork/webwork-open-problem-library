<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

What is the wavelength of the waves you create in a swimming pool if you splash your hand at a rate of \($freq\) \(\textrm{Hz}\) and the waves propagate at \($speed\) \(\textrm{m/s}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the velocity of a wave to its frequency and wavelength.
