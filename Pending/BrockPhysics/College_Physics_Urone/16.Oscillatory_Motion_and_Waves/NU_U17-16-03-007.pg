$PAR

Suppose a diving board with no one on it bounces up and down in a simple harmonic motion with a frequency of \($freq\) \(\textrm{Hz}\). The board has an effective mass of \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\). What is the frequency of the simple harmonic motion of a \($mass2\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) diver on the board? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you find and equate two equivalent expressions given the spring constant, both in terms of their respective frequency and mass? Be careful - the second mass is not simply that of the diver.
