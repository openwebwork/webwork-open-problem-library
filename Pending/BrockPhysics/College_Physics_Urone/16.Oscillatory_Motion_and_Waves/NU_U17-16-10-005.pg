$PAR

A wave traveling on a SlinkyÂ® that is stretched to \($distance\) \(\textrm{m}\) takes \($time\) \(\textrm{s}\) to travel the length of the Slinky and back again.

$PAR

a) What is the speed of the wave?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall speed is defined as the change in distance divided by the change in time. Be careful - the time given is that taken for the wave to travel <i>twice</i> the length of the Slinky.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Using the same Slinky stretched to the same length, a standing wave is created which consists of three antinodes and four nodes. At what frequency must the Slinky be oscillating?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the velocity of a wave to its frequency and wavelength. What is the wavelength of the wave, given that a full wavelength (<i>i.e.</i> one cycle of a sine wave) consists of three nodes and two antinodes? It may help you to draw a diagram.
