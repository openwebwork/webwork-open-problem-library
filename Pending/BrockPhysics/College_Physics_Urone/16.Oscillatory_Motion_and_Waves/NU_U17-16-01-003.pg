$PAR

One type of BB gun uses a spring-driven plunger to blow the BB from its barrel.
$PAR

a)  Calculate the force constant of its plunger's spring if you must compress it \($x\) \(\textrm{m}\) to drive the \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) plunger to a top speed of \($v\) \(\textrm{m/s}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Consider solving this problem using conservation of energy. What must have been the energy stored in the spring to drive forward the plunger at the given speed?
END_HINT 

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What force must be exerted to compress the spring?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Hooke's Law.
