$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

At which positions is the speed of a simple harmonic oscillator half its maximum speed? That is, which values of \(x/X\) give \(v = \pm v_{max} / 2\), where \(X\) is the amplitude of the motion?

$PAR

\(x/X = \pm\) \{ans_rule(30)\}

BEGIN_HINT
At its maximum speed, is not the kinetic energy simply equal to the total mechanical energy? Using this, can you then make an appropriate substitution for velocity in the formula giving the total mechanical energy stored within a simple harmonic oscillator?
