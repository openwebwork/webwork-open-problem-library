$PAR

Three adjacent keys on a piano (\(\textrm{F}\), \(\textrm{F-sharp}\), and \(\textrm{G}\)) are struck simultaneously, producing frequencies of \(349\), \(370\), and \(392\) \(\textrm{Hz}\). What beat frequencies are produced by this discordant combination?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\) < \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\) < \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall beat frequency is defined as the difference in frequency between two similar-frequency waves.
