<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Storms in the South Pacific can create waves that travel all the way to the California coast, which are \(12,000\) \(\textrm{km}\) away. How long does it take them if they travel at \($speed\) \(\textrm{m/s}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall speed is defined as the change in distance divided by the change in time.
