$PAR

Engineering Application: Each cylinder of an engine makes a sharp sound every other revolution of the engine.

$PAR

(a) How fast is a race car going if its eight-cylinder engine emits a sound of frequency \($fq\) \(\textrm{Hz}\), given that the engine makes \($rev\) revolutions per kilometer?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
First determine the frequency sounded by <i>each</i> cylinder. Dimensional analysis will be of great assistance from there on out. Pay careful attention to the units.

(b) At how many revolutions per minute is the engine rotating?
