$PAR

a)  A novelty clock has a \($mass\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) mass object bouncing on a spring that has a force constant of \($force\) \(\textrm{N/m}\). What is the maximum velocity of the object if the object bounces \($height\) \(\textrm{m}\) above and below its equilibrium position?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the total mechanical energy stored within a simple harmonic oscillator. At what displacement from equilibrium is the object's kinetic energy (and thus its velocity) maximized?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

$PAR

b) How many joules of kinetic energy does the object have at its maximum velocity?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)
