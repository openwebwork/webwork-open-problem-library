$PAR

The length of nylon rope from which a mountain climber is suspended has a force constant of \($force \) \(\textrm{N/m}\).

$PAR

a) What is the frequency at which he bounces, given his mass plus and the mass of his equipment are \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the frequency of a simple harmonic oscillator to its mass and spring constant.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How much would this rope stretch to break the climber's fall if he free-falls \($fall\) \(\textrm{m}\) before the rope runs out of slack?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Begin by identifying and equating the sources of energy in the climber's initial and final states, but be careful - as the nylon rope stretches, the climber will continue to lose gravitational potential energy. If you have done this question correctly, you will end up solving a quadratic equation.
