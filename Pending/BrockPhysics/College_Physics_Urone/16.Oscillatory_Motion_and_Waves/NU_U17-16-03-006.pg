$PAR

A diver on a diving board is undergoing simple harmonic motion. Her mass is \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) and the period of her motion is \($T\) \(\textrm{s}\). The next diver is a male whose period of simple harmonic oscillation is \($T2\) \(\textrm{s}\). What is his mass if the mass of the board is negligible?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you find and equate two expressions giving the spring constant of the board, one in terms of the parameters describing the male diver  and the other in terms of those belonging to the female diver?
