$PAR

An object is attached to a spring at its unloaded rest position and allowed to bounce up and down.

$PAR

END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
a)  If the spring has a force constant of \($force\) \(\textrm{N/m}\) and a \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mass object is set in motion as described, find the amplitude of the oscillations.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Consider solving this problem using conservation of energy. What must be the the <i>total</i> stretch of the spring after all of the object's potential energy has been translated from gravitational to elastic? How does this total stretch relate to the amplitude of the object's oscillation?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Find the maximum velocity.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the object attains its maximum velocity as it traverses the equilibrium position, the point at which the mechanical energy of the system is entirely kinetic.
END_HINT
