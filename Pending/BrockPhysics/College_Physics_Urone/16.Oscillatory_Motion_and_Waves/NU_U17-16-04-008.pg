$PAR

A pendulum with a period of \(2.000\) \(\textrm{s}\) in one location where the acceleration due to gravity is \(9.80\) \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\) is moved to a new location where the period is now \($period\) \(\textrm{s}\). What is the acceleration due to gravity at its new location?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Can you find and equate two equivalent expressions giving the length of the simple pendulum, both in terms of their respective mass and surface gravity?
