<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose you have a \($mass\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) object on a horizontal surface connected to a spring that has a force constant of \($force\) \(\textrm{N/m}\). There is simple friction between the object and surface with a static coefficient of friction \($sfriction\).

$PAR

a) How far can the spring be stretched without moving the mass?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT 
What spring force balances with static friction at its maximum?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) If the object is set into oscillation with an amplitude twice the distance found in part (a), and the kinetic coefficient of friction is \($kfriction\) , what total distance does it travel before stopping? Assume it starts at the maximum amplitude.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What distance will the the object travel before the elastic potential energy stored within the spring is entirely converted into thermal energy?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));
