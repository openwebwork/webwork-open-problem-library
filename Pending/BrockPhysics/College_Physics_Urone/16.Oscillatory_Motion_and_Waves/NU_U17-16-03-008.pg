$PAR

A child bounces in a harness suspended from a door frame by a spring constant.

$PAR

a)  If the spring stretches \($stretch1\) \(\textrm{m}\) while supporting an \($mass\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) child, what is its spring constant? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
The spring is stretched by its equilibrium distance when the child's weight and the spring force are balanced.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the time for one complete bounce of this child? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
In other words, find the period of the child's oscillation.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What is the child's maximum velocity if the amplitude of her bounce is \($Amplitude\) \(\textrm{m}\)? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the child will attain their maximum velocity as they traverse the equilibrium position, the point at which the mechanical energy of the child-harness system is entirely kinetic.
END_HINT
