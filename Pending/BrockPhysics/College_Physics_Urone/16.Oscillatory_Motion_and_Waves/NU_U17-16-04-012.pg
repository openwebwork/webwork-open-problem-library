$PAR

Suppose the length of a clock's pendulum is changed by an increase of \(1.000\)\(\textrm{%}\), exactly at noon one day. How slow will the clock be, rounded to the nearest second, after \(24.00\) hours have passed, assuming the pendulum has kept perfect time before the change?

BEGIN_HINT
Begin by finding the ratio of the new to old periods. For every \(24.00\) hours that would have elapsed on the old pendulum, how many now elapse on the new, longer pendulum? Is not the difference between these two rates the time by which (in hours, after one day) the pendulum runs slow?
