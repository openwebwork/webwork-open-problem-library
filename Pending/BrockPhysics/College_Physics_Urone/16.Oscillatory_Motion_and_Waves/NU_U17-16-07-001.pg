$PAR

The amplitude of a lightly damped oscillator decreases by \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) during each cycle. What is the percent decrease in mechanical energy per cycle?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
In general, percent decrease is defined as the difference between initial and final states divided by the initial state.
