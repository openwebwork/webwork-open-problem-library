$PAR

What is the wavelength of an earthquake that shakes you with a frequency of \($freq\) \(\textrm{Hz}\) and gets to another city \($distance\) \(\textrm{km}\) away in \($time\) \(\textrm{s}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the velocity of a wave to its frequency and wavelength. Can you make an appropriate substitution for velocity using the displacement and time provided?
