$PAR

Wind gusts create ripples on the ocean that have a wavelength of \($length\) \(\textrm{m}\) and propagate at \($speed\) \(\textrm{m/s}\). What is their frequency?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the velocity of a wave to its frequency and wavelength.
