Astronomy Application: Energy from the Sun arrives at the top of the Earth's atmosphere with an intensity of \($intensity\) \(\textrm{kW/m}^2\) . How long does it take for \($power \times 10^{9}\) \(\textrm{J}\)  to arrive on an area of \(1\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) ?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall intensity is defined as the power per unit area. What is the definition of average power?
