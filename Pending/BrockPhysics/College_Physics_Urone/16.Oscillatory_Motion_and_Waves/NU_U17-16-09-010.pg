$PAR

Seismographs measure the arrival times of earthquakes with a precision of \(0.100\) \(\textrm{s}\). To get the distance to the epicenter of the quake, they compare the arrival times of S- and P-waves, which travel at different speeds. If S- and P-waves travel at \($S\) \(\textrm{km/s}\) and \($P\) \(\textrm{km/s}\), respectively, in the region considered, how precisely can the distance to the source of the earthquake be determined?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall speed is defined as the change in distance divided by the change in time.
