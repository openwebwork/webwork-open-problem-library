$PAR

Engineering Application: A suspension bridge oscillates with an effective force constant of \($force \times 10^{8}\) \(\textrm{N/m}\). 

$PAR

a) How much energy is needed to make it oscillate with an amplitude of \($distance\) \(\textrm{m}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the total mechanical energy stored within a simple harmonic oscillator.

$PAR

b) If soldiers march across the bridge with a cadence equal to the bridge's natural frequency and impart \($energy \times 10^{4}\) \(\textrm{J}\) of energy each second, how long does it take for the bridge's oscillations to go from \($distance\) \(\textrm{m}\) to \($distance2\) \(\textrm{m}\) amplitude?
