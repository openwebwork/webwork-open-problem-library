$PAR

The low-frequency speaker of a stereo set has a surface area of \($SA\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and produces \(1\) \(\textrm{W}\)  of acoustical power. 

$PAR

a) What is the intensity at the speaker?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W/m}^2\) 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall intensity is defined as the power per unit area.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b)  If the speaker projects sound uniformly in all directions, at what distance from the speaker is the intensity equal to \($intensity\) \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\) 

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What is the surface area of a sphere?
