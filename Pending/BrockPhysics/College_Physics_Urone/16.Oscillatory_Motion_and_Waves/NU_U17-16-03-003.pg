<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mass suspended from a spring oscillates with a period of \($T1\) \(\textrm{s}\). How much mass must be added to the object to change the period to \($T2\) \(\textrm{s}\)?

$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Be careful - the question is asking for the <i>difference</i> in mass, not the total mass needed to cause this new period of oscillation.
