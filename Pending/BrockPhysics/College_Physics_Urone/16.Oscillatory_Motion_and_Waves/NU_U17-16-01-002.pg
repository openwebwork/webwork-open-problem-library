$PAR

It is weigh-in time for the local under-\(85\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) rugby team. The bathroom scale used to assess eligibility can be described by Hooke's law and is depressed \($x\) \(\textrm{cm}\) by its maximum load of \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

$PAR

a)  What is the spring's effective spring constant?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) A player stands on the scales and depresses it by \($x2\) \(\textrm{cm}\). What is that players mass in \(\textrm{kg}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For both (a) and (b), the rugby players compress the scale by its equilibrium distance when their weight and the spring force balance.
