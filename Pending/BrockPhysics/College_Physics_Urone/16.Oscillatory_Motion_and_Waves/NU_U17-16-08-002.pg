$PAR

If a car has a suspension system with a force constant of \($force \times 10^{4}\) \(\textrm{N/m}\), how much energy must the car's shocks remove to dampen an oscillation starting with a maximum displacement of \($displacement \) \(\textrm{m}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Pay attention to the wording - of what fraction of the total mechanical energy does elastic potential energy consist when the oscillator is at its maximum displacement from equilibrium?
