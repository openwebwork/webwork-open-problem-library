a) A spring that has stiffness constant \(224\) N/m rests at its equilibrium length of \(14\) cm. You gently pull on the end of the spring, stretching it to a length of \(16\) cm, where you hold the spring at rest. Determine the magnitude of the force that you need to hold the spring at its new length.

b) A spring that has stiffness constant \(224\) N/m rests at its equilibrium length of \(10\) cm. You gently pull on the end of the spring, stretching it to a length of \(12\) cm, where you hold the spring at rest.
