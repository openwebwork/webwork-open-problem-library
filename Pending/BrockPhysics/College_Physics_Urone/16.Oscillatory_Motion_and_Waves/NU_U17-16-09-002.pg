BEGIN_TEXT
Waves on a swimming pool propagate at \($speed\) \(\textrm{m/s}\). You splash the water at one end of the pool and observe the wave go to the opposite end, reflect, and return in \($time\) \(\textrm{s}\). How far away is the other end of the pool?

BEGIN_HINT
Be careful - the given time is that taken for the waves to travel <i>twice</i> the length of the pool.
