$PAR

What is the intensity of a laser beam used to burn away cancerous tissue that, when \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) absorbed, puts \($power\) \(\textrm{J}\) of energy into a circular spot \($diameter\) \(\textrm{mm}\) in diameter in \($time\) \(\textrm{s}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall intensity is defined as the power per unit area. What is the definition of average power?
