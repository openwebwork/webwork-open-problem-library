$PAR

The springs of a pickup truck act like a single spring with a force constant of \($constant \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N/m}\).

$PAR

a)  By how much will the truck be depressed by its maximum load of \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\)? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
The truck's suspension will have been compressed by its equilibrium distance when the truck's weight and the spring force balance.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) If the pickup truck has four identical springs, what is the force constant of each?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Treat the truck's suspension as four springs connected in parallel.
END_HINT
