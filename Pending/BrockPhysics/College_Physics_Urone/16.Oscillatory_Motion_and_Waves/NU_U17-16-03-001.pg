$PAR

A type of cuckoo clock keeps time by having a mass bouncing on a spring, usually something cute like a cherub in a chair. What force constant is needed to produce a period of \($T\) \(\textrm{s}\) for a \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mass?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you find and equate two equivalent expressions for angular frequency, one in terms of the spring constant and the other in terms of the period?
