$PAR

How many times a minute does a boat bob up and down on ocean waves that have a wavelength of \($length\) \(\textrm{m}\) and a propagation speed of \($speed\) \(\textrm{m/s}\)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{times}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the velocity of a wave to its frequency and wavelength. Be careful - you are being asked to find frequency, but not in \(\textrm{SI}\) units.
