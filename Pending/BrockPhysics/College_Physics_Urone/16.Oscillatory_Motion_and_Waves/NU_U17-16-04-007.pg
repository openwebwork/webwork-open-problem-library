$PAR

A pendulum that has a period of \($T\) \(\textrm{m}\) and that is located where the acceleration due to gravity is \(9.79\) \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\) is moved to a location where the acceleration due to gravity is  \(9.82\) \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\). What is its new period?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you find and equate two equivalent expressions giving the length of the simple pendulum, both in terms of their respective mass and surface gravity?
