$PAR

When an \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) man stands on a pogo stick, the spring is compressed \($x\) \(\textrm{m}\).

$PAR

a)  What is the force constant of the spring? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
The pogo stick will have been compressed by its equilibrium distance when the man's weight and the spring force balance.
