<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A spring has a length of \($length1\) \(\textrm{m}\) when a \($mass1\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mass hangs from it, and a length of \($length2\) \(\textrm{m}\) when a \($mass2\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mass hangs from it.

$PAR

a)  What is the force constant of the spring? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
The hanging object will have extended the spring by its equilibrium distance when the object's weight and the spring force balance.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b)  What is the unloaded length of the spring?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the spring constant is the slope of the line passing through several \(\textrm{(x, F)}\) data points, where \(\textrm{F}\) is the force applied and \(\textrm{x}\) is the distance extended. Can you find the \(y\)-intercept of this equation?
