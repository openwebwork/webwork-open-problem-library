$PAR

Scouts at a camp shake the rope bridge they have just crossed and observe the wave crests to be \($length\) \(\textrm{m}\) apart. If they shake it the bridge twice per second, what is the propagation speed of the waves?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula relating the velocity of a wave to its frequency and wavelength. What parameter do you suppose the bridge shaking "twice per second" represents?
