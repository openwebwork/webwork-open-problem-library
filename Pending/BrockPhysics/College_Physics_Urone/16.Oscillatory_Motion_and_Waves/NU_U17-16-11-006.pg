$PAR

Suppose you have a device that extracts energy from ocean breakers in direct proportion to their intensity. If the device produces \($power\) \(\textrm{kW}\) of power on a day when the breakers are \($height\) \(\textrm{m}\) high, how much will it produce when they are \($height2\) \(\textrm{m}\) high?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kW}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude.
