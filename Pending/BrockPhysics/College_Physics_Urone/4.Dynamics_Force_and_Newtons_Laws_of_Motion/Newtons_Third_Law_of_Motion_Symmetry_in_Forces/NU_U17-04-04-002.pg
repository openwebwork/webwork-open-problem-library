$PAR

A brave but inadequate rugby player is being pushed backward by an opposing player who is exerting a force of \($force_internalSI \, \textrm{N}\) on him. The mass of the losing player plus equipment is \($mass_smallSI \, \textrm{kg}\), and he is accelerating at \($v \, \textrm{m/s}^2\) backward.

$PAR

(a) What is the force of friction between the losing player's feet and the grass? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

(b) What force does the winning player exert on the ground to move forward if his mass plus equipment is \($mass_largeSI \, \textrm{kg}\)?
 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the winning player feels the losing player's force as well as friction.
