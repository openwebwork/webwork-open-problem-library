<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A \($m \, \textrm{kg}\) dolphin decelerates from \(12.0 \, \textrm{m/s}\) to \(7.50 \, \textrm{m/s}\) in \($t \, \textrm{s}\) to join another dolphin in play. What average force was exerted to slow him if he was moving horizontally? (The gravitational force is balanced by the buoyant force of the water.)
