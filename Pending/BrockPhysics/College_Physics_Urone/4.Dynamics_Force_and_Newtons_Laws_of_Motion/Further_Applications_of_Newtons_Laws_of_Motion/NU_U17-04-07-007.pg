$PAR
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A basketball player jumps straight up for a ball. To do this, he lowers his body \($d \, \textrm{m}\) and then accelerates through this distance by forcefully straightening his legs. This player leaves the floor with a vertical velocity sufficient to carry him \($h \, \textrm{m}\) above the floor. 
$PAR
(a) Calculate his velocity when he leaves the floor. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$P1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR

(b) Calculate his acceleration while he is straightening his legs. He goes from zero to the velocity found in part (a) in a distance of \($d \, \textrm{m}\). 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(c) Calculate the force he exerts on the floor to do this, given that his mass is \($m \, \textrm{kg}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F"));

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the kinematics formul&#230; to solve for unknowns?
