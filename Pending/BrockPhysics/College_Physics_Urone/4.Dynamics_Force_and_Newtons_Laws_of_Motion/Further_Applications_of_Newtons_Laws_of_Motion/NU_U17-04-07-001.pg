$PAR
A flea jumps by exerting a force of  \($f \times 10^{-5} \, \textrm{N}\) straight down on the ground. A breeze blowing on the flea parallel to the ground exerts a force of \($b \times 10^{-6} \, \textrm{N}\) on the flea. Find the direction and magnitude of the acceleration of the flea if its mass is \($m \times 10^{-7} \, \textrm{kg}\). Do not neglect the gravitational force.
$PAR

Acceleration: \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)
$PAR
Directon: \{ans_rule(40)\} degrees from the vertical
