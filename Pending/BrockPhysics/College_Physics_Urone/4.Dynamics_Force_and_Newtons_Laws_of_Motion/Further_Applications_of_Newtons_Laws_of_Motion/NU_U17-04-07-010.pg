$PAR
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> An elevator filled with passengers has a mass of \($m \, \textrm{kg}\). 
$PAR
(a) The elevator accelerates upward from rest at a rate of \($a \, \textrm{m/s}^2\) for \($t \, \textrm{s}\). Calculate the tension in the cable supporting the elevator. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) The elevator continues upward at constant velocity for \(8.50 \, \textrm{s}\). What is the tension in the cable during this time? 
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$F2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(c) The elevator decelerates at a rate of \($d \, \textrm{m/s}^2\) for \($t2 \, \textrm{s}\). What is the tension in the cable during deceleration? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(d) How high has the elevator moved above its original starting point?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A4"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(e) What is its final velocity?
$PAR

END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Divide the motion into stages (ex. accelerating, constant velocity, decelerating).
