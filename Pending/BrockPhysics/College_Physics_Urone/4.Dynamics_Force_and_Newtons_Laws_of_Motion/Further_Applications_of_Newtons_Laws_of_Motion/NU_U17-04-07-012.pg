$PAR
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A \($m \, \textrm{kg}\) man stands on a bathroom scale in an elevator that accelerates from rest to \($v \, \textrm{m/s}\) in \($t \, \textrm{s}\). Calculate the scale reading in newtons and compare it with his weight. (The scale exerts an upward force on him equal to its reading.)

Force: \{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

BEGIN_HINT
It may be helpful to write an expression for the net force.
