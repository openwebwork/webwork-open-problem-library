$PAR
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A large rocket has a mass of \($m \times 10^{6} \, \textrm{kg}\) at takeoff, and its engines produce a thrust of \($t \times 10^{7} \, \textrm{N}\).
$PAR 
(a) Find its initial acceleration if it takes off vertically. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$P3"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) How long does it take to reach a velocity of \($v \, \textrm{km/h}\) straight up, assuming constant mass and thrust?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to make the appropriate unit conversions.
