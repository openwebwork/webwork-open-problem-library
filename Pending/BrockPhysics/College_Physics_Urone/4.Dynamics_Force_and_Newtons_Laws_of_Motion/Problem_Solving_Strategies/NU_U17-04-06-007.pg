$PAR
$PAR
 A \($m \, \textrm{kg}\) car pulls a boat on a trailer.

$PAR
$PAR

(a) What total force resists the motion of the car, boat, and trailer, if the car exerts a \($f \, \textrm{N}\) force on the road and produces an acceleration of \($v \, \textrm{m/s}^2\)? The mass of the boat plus trailer is \($b \,\textrm{kg}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)


END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) What is the force in the hitch between the car and the trailer if \(80\textrm{%}\) of the resisting forces are experienced by the boat and trailer?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
For part (b), consider the net force acting on the boat and trailer system.
