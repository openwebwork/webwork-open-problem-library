$PAR
Commercial airplanes are sometimes pushed out of the passenger loading area by a tractor. 
$PAR
(a) An \(1800 \, \textrm{kg}\) tractor exerts a force of \($f \times 10^{4} \, \textrm{N}\) backward on the pavement, and the system experiences forces resisting motion that total \(2400 \, \textrm{N}\). If the acceleration is \($a \, \textrm{m/s}^2\), what is the mass of the airplane? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) Calculate the force exerted by the tractor on the airplane, assuming \(2200 \, \textrm{N}\) of the friction is experienced by the airplane.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Draw a free body diagram to help evaluate the directions of forces acting on the system of interest.
