$PAR

A \($m \times 10^{5} \, \textrm{kg}\) rocket is accelerating straight up. Its engines produce \($t  \times 10^{7} \, \textrm{N}\) of thrust, and air resistance is \($r \times 10^{6} \, \textrm{N}\) . What is the rocket's acceleration? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the direction of the forces when solving this problem.
