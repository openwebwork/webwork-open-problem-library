$PAR

 Two teams of nine members each engage in a tug of war. Each of the first team's members has an average mass of \($t1 \, \textrm{kg}\) and exerts an average force of \($f1 \, \textrm{N}\) horizontally. Each of the second team's members has an average mass of \($t2 \, \textrm{kg}\) and exerts an average force of \($f2 \, \textrm{N}\) horizontally. 
$PAR
(a) What is the acceleration of the two teams? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
(b) What is the tension in the section of rope between the teams?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)
$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Try drawing a free body diagram to help you visualize the forces involved. Remember Newton's Third Law when you do this!
