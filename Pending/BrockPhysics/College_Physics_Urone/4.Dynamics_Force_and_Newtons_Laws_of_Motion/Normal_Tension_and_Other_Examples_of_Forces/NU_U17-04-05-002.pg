$PAR

What force does a trampoline have to apply to a \(45.0 \, \textrm{kg}\) gymnast to accelerate her straight up at \($v \, \textrm{m/s}^2\)? Note that the answer is independent of the velocity of the gymnastâ€”she can be moving either up or down, or be stationary.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the force which accelerates her upwards is opposing the force of gravity.
