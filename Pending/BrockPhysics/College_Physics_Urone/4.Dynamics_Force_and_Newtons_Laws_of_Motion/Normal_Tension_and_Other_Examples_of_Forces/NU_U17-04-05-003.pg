<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
(a) Calculate the tension in a vertical strand of spider web if a spider of mass \($m \times 10^{-5} \, \textrm{kg}\) hangs motionless on it.
$PAR

BEGIN_TEXT
(b) Calculate the tension in a horizontal strand of spider web if the same spider sits motionless in the middle of it, much like the tightrope walker in the figure below. The strand sags at an angle of \($t^{\circ}\) below the horizontal. 

$PAR

Compare this with the tension in Part (a). That is, enter the ratio of the new tension divided by the old tension in the answer slot below. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
In part (b) assume the tension on the left and right side of the strand are equivalent.
