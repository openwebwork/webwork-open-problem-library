$PAR
 Since astronauts in orbit are apparently weightless, a clever method of measuring their masses is needed to monitor their mass gains or losses to adjust diets. One way to do this is to exert a known force on an astronaut and measure the acceleration produced. Suppose a net external force of \(50.0 \, \textrm{N}\) is exerted and the astronaut's acceleration is measured to be \($P \, \textrm{m/s}^2\). 
$PAR
(a) Calculate her mass. 
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) By exerting a force on the astronaut, the vehicle in which they orbit experiences an equal and opposite force. Calculate the magnitude of acceleration of the ship if the ship's mass is equal to \($r \, \textrm{kg}\). 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Have you tried equating the forces that the astronaut and the ship experience?
