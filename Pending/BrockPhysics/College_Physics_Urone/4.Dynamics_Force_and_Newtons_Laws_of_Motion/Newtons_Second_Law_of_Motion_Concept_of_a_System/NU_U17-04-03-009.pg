$PAR

Suppose two children push horizontally, but in exactly opposite directions, on a third child in a wagon. The first child exerts a force of \(75.0 \, \(\textrm{N}\), the second a force of \(90.0 \, \textrm{N}\), friction is \($d1 \, \textrm{N}\), and the mass of the third child plus wagon is \($w \, \textrm{kg}\).
$PAR
(a) Calculate the acceleration. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR

(b) What would the acceleration be if friction were \(15.0 \, \textrm{N}\)? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Determine the direction of the frictional force.
