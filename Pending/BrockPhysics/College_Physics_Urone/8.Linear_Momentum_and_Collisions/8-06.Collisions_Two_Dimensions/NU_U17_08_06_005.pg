<b>Professional Application:</b> Ernest Rutherford (the first New Zealander to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry) demonstrated that nuclei were very small and dense by scattering helium-4 nuclei, \( ^{4} \textrm{He}\), from gold-197 nuclei, \( ^{197} \textrm{Au}\). The energy of the incoming helium nucleus was \(8.00 \times 10^{-13} \, \textrm{J}\), and the masses of the helium and gold nuclei were \(6.68 \times 10^{-27} \, \textrm{kg}\) and \(3.29 \times 10^{-25} \, \textrm{kg}\), respectively (note that their mass ratio is 4 to 197).

$PAR
a) If a helium nucleus scatters to an angle of \($theta1 ^{\circ}\) during an elastic collision with a gold nucleus, determine the angle at which the gold nucleus itself scatters.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} degrees from the initial direction of the helium nucleus

$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Begin by writing three equations, two describing the conservation of momentum (that is, one equation for each of the horizontal and vertical directions), and the other, the conservation of kinetic energy. Can you then solve these simultaneously for the unknown variables?

b) What is the final kinetic energy of the helium nucleus?
