<b>Professional Application:</b> Ion-propulsion rockets have been proposed for use in space. They employ atomic ionization techniques and nuclear energy sources to produce extremely high exhaust velocities, perhaps as great as \($va \times 10^{6} \, \textrm{m/s}\). These techniques allow a much more favorable payload-to-fuel ratio. To illustrate this fact:

$PAR
a) Calculate the increase in velocity of a \($mo \textrm{-kg}\) space probe that expels only \($m1 \textrm{-kg}\) of its mass at the given exhaust velocity.

What is the final mass of the rocket?

$PAR
b) These engines are usually designed to produce a very small thrust for a very long timeâ€” the type of engine that might be useful on a trip to the outer planets, for example. Calculate the acceleration of such an engine if it expels \($mta \times 10^{-6} \, \textrm{kg/s}\) at the given velocity, assuming the acceleration due to gravity is negligible.
