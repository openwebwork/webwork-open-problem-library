$PAR
Suppose a clay model of a koala bear has a mass of \($m1 \, \textrm{kg}\) and slides on ice at a speed of \($v1 \, \textrm{m/s}\). It runs into another clay model, which is initially motionless and has a mass of \($m2 \, \textrm{kg}\). Both being soft clay, they naturally stick together. What is their final velocity?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of momentum. What is the final mass of the system, given that the clay sculptures stick together upon collision?
