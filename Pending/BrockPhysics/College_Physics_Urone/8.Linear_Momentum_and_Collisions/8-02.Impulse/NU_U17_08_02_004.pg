<b>Professional Application:</b> A professional boxer hits his opponent with a \($F \textrm{-N}\) horizontal blow that lasts for \($t \, \textrm{s}\).

$PAR
a) Calculate the impulse imparted by this blow.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg} \cdot \textrm{m/s}\)

b) What is the opponent's final velocity, if his mass is \($mb \, \textrm{kg}\)  and he is motionless in midair when struck near his center of mass?

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the most general form of Newton's second law to solve for recoil velocity of the opposing boxer's center of mass?

$PAR
c) Calculate the recoil velocity of the opponent's \($mc \textrm{-kg}\) head if hit in this manner, assuming the head does not initially transfer significant momentum to the boxer's body.
