<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR
<b>Professional Application:</b> Suppose a child drives a bumper car head on into the siderail, which exerts a force of \($F \, \textrm{N}\) on the car for \($t \, \textrm{s}\).

$PAR
a) What impulse is imparted by this force? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg} \cdot \textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Does this applied force oppose or contribute to the motion of the car and child?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$p"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) Find the final velocity of the bumper car if its initial velocity was \($vib \, \textrm{m/s}\) and the car plus driver have a mass of \($m \, \textrm{kg}\). You may neglect friction between the car and floor.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the most general form of Newton's second law to solve for the car-child system's recoil velocity?
