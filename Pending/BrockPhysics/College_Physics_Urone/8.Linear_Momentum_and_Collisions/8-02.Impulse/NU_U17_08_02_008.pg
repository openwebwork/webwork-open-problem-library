$PAR
<b>Professional Application:</b> Military rifles have a mechanism for reducing the recoil
forces of the gun on the person firing it. An internal part recoils over a relatively large
distance and is stopped by damping mechanisms in the gun. The larger distance
reduces the average force needed to stop the internal part. 

$PAR
a) Calculate the recoil velocity of a \($m1 \textrm{-kg}\) plunger that directly interacts with a \($m2 \textrm{-kg}\) bullet fired at \($v2l \, \textrm{m/s}\) from the gun. 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of momentum.
END_HINT

$PAR
b) If this part is stopped over a distance of \($xcm \, \textrm{cm}\), what average force is exerted upon it by the gun? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Recall Newton's second law. Can you first solve for the acceleration of the part using one of the kinematics equations?
END_HINT

c) Compare this to the force exerted on the gun if the bullet is accelerated to its velocity in \($tms \, \textrm{ms}\).
