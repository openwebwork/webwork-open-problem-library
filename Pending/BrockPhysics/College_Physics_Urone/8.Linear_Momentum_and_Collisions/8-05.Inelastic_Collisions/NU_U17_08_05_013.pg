$PAR
During a circus act, an elderly performer thrills the crowd by catching a cannon ball
shot at him. The cannon ball has a mass of \($m1 \, \textrm{kg}\) and the horizontal component of its velocity is \($v1 \, \textrm{m/s}\) when the \($m2 \textrm{-kg}\) performer catches it. If the performer is on nearly frictionless roller skates, what is his recoil velocity?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of momentum. What is the final mass of the system?
