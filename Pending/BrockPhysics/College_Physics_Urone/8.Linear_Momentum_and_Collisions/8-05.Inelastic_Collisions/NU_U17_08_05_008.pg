$PAR
A \($m2 \textrm{-kg}\) bullet is accelerated from rest to a speed of \($v2 \, \textrm{m/s}\) in a \($m1 \textrm{-kg}\) rifle. The pain of the rifle's kick is much worse if you hold the gun loosely a few centimetres from your shoulder rather than holding it tightly against your shoulder. 

$PAR
a) Calculate the recoil velocity of the rifle if it is held loosely away from the shoulder. 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of momentum. What effective mass is set in motion to balance the forward momentum of the bullet?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$v1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
b) How much kinetic energy does the rifle gain? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$KE"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
c) What is the recoil velocity if the rifle is held tightly against the shoulder, making the effective mass \($m1c \, \textrm{kg}\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$v1c"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
d) How much kinetic energy is transferred to the rifle-shoulder combination? The pain is related to the amount of kinetic energy, which is significantly less in this latter situation.
