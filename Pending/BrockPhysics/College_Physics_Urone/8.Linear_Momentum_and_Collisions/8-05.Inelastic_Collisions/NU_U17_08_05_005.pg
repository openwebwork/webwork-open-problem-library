<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR
<b>Professional Application:</b> Two manned satellites approaching one another, at a relative speed of \($v2 \, \textrm{m/s}\), intending to dock. The first has a mass of \($m1a \times 10^{3} \, \textrm{kg}\), and the second a mass of \($m2a \times 10^{3} \, \textrm{kg}\). 

$PAR
Take the direction in which the second satellite was initially travelling as positive.

$PAR
a) Calculate the final velocity (after docking) by using the frame of reference in which the first satellite was originally at rest. 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of momentum. What is the final mass of the system?

b) What is the loss of kinetic energy in this inelastic collision?

d) Repeat part (b) by using the frame of reference in which the second satellite was originally at rest. Explain why the change in velocity is different in the two frames, whereas the change in kinetic energy is the same in both.
