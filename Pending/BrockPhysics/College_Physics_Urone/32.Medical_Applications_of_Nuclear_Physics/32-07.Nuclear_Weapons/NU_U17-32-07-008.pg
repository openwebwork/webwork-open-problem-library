BEGIN_TEXT
This problem gives some idea of the magnitude of the energy yield of a small tactical
bomb. Assume that half the energy of a \($kT\)-kT nuclear depth charge set off under an
aircraft carrier goes into lifting it out of the waterâ€”that is, into gravitational
potential energy. How high is the carrier lifted if its mass is \($mass\) tons?
