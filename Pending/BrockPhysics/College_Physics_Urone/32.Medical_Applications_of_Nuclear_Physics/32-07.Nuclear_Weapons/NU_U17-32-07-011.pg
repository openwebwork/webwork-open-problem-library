$BR
One scheme to put nuclear weapons to nonmilitary use is to explode them underground in a geologically stable region and extract the geothermal energy for electricity production. There was a total yield of about \($totalMT\) MT in the combined arsenals in 2006. If \($E\) MT per day could be converted to electricity with an efficiency of \($percent\)%:
