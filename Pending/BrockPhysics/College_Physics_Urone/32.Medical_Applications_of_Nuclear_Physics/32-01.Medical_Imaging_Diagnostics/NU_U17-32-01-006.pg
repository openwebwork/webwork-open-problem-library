BEGIN_TEXT
The activities of \(^{131}\textrm{I}\) and \(^{123}\textrm{I}\) used in thyroid scans are given to be \($uCi131\) and \($uCi123\)Î¼Ci , respectively. Find the masses of \(^{131}\textrm{I}\) and \(^{123}\textrm{I}\) in such scans, given their respective half-lives are \($time131\) d and \($time123\) h. The masses are so small that the radio iodine is usually mixed with stable iodine as a carrier to ensure normal chemistry and distribution in the body.
