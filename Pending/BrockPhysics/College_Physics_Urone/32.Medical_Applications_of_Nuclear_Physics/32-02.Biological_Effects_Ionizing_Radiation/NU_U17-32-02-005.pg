BEGIN_TEXT
One half the \(\gamma\) rays from \(^{99m}\textrm{Tc}\) are absorbed by a \($thick\)-mm-thick lead shielding. Half of the \(\gamma\) rays that pass through the first layer of lead are absorbed in a second layer of equal thickness. What thickness of lead will absorb all but one in \(1000\) of these \(\gamma\) rays?
