BEGIN_TEXT
Large amounts of \(^{65}\textrm{Zn}\) are produced in copper exposed to accelerator beams. While machining contaminated copper, a physicist ingests \($uCi\) Î¼Ci of \(^{65}\textrm{Zn}\). Each \(^{65}\textrm{Zn}\) decay emits an average \(\gamma\) -ray energy of \($MeV\) MeV, \($percent\)% of which is absorbed in the scientist's \($mass\)-kg body. What dose in mSv is caused by this in one day?
