Calculate the dose in Sv to the chest of a patient given an x-ray under the following conditions. The x-ray beam intensity is \($Intensity\) \(\textrm{W/m}^2\) , the area of the chest exposed is \($Area\) \(\textrm{m}^2\), \($percent\)% of the x-rays are absorbed in \($mass\) kg of tissue, and the exposure time is \($time\) s.
