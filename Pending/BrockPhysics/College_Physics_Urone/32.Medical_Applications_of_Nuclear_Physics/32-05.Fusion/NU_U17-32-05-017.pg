Integrated Concepts 
$BR
a) Estimate the years that the deuterium fuel in the oceans could supply the energy needs of the world. Assume world energy consumption to be ten times that of the United States which is \(8 \times 10^{19}\) J/y and that the deuterium in the oceans could be converted to energy with an efficiency of \(30\)%. You must estimate or look up the amount of water in the oceans and take the deuterium content to be \(0.015\)% of natural hydrogen to find the mass of deuterium available. Note that approximate energy yield of deuterium is \(3.37 \times 10^{14}\) J/kg.
