<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Suppose you have a \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) wooden crate resting on a wood floor. 

$PAR

a) What maximum force can you exert horizontally on the crate without moving it? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Pay attention to the wording - what two materials are interacting? Is this a situation of static or kinetic friction?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$fa"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) If you continue to exert this force once the crate starts to slip, what will the magnitude of its acceleration then be?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What type of friction acts on the object as it moves?
END_HINT
