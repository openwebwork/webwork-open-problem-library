$PAR

A freight train consists of two \($trainm \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{kg}\) engines and \(45\) cars with average masses of \($caram \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{kg}\) . 

$PAR

a) What force must each engine exert backward on the track to accelerate the train at a rate of \($alpha \times 10^{-2}\) \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\) if the force of friction is \($fof \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{N}\), assuming the engines exert identical forces? This is not a large frictional force for such a massive system. Rolling friction for trains is small, and consequently trains are very energy-efficient transportation systems. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What is the total mass of the train?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$TotalForce"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the \(37\)th and \(38\)th cars (this is the force each exerts on the other), assuming all cars have the same mass and that friction is evenly distributed among all of the cars and engines?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Newton's Second Law. What is the acceleration of the \(37\)th car? Against what fraction of the total friction must it exert a force?
