<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Consider the \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) ice skater being pushed by two others shown in the above figure. The coefficient of static friction between the steel blades of her skates and the ice is \($us\) and the coefficient of kinetic friction is \($uk\).

$PAR

a) Find the magnitude of the total force exerted on her by the others, given that the magnitudes \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are \($F1\) \(\textrm{N}\) and \($F2\) \(\textrm{N}\), respectively.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that forces are vectors and thus must be added geometrically, tip-to-tail.
END_HINT 

ANS(num_cmp("$FT"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) In which direction does the total force act?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{degrees North of East}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Trigonometry might be of use to you here - the forces enclose a right angle triangle.
END_HINT 

ANS(num_cmp("$direction"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What is her initial acceleration if she is initially stationary and wearing steel-bladed skates that point in the direction of the total force?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Newton's Second Law. What forces act on the skater?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationc"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

d) What is her acceleration assuming she is already moving in the direction of the total force? (Remember that friction always acts in the direction opposite that of motion or attempted motion between surfaces in contact).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What force now differs from those identified in part (c), given that the skater is already in motion?
