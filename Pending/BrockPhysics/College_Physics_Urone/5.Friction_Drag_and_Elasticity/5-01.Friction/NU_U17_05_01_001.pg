$PAR

A physics major is cooking breakfast when he notices that the frictional force between his steel spatula and his Teflon frying pan is only \($f \, \textrm{N}\). Knowing the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two materials, he quickly calculates the normal force.
$PAR
What is it?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the frictional force is proportional to the normal force, and the proportionality constant is the coefficient of friction. Look up the coefficient of friction in the textbook.
