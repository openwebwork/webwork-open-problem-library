$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

Calculate the magnitude of the maximum acceleration of a car that is heading down a \($degree^{\circ}\) slope (one that makes an angle of \($degree^{\circ}\) with the horizontal) under the following road conditions. You may assume that the weight of the car is evenly distributed on all four tires and that the coefficient of static friction is involvedâ€”that is, the tires are not allowed to slip during the deceleration. (Ignore rolling).

$PAR

a) On dry concrete:

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationa"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) On wet concrete:

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationb"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) On ice, assuming that the coefficient of static friction is the same as for shoes on ice:

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For each of (a), (b), and (c), you will need to determine the appropriate coefficient of static friction. What forces (or components thereof) act on the car?
