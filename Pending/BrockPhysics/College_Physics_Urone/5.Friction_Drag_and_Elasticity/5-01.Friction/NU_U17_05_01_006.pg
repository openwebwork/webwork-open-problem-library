$PAR

A team of eight dogs pulls a sled with waxed wood runners on wet snow (mush!). The dogs have average masses of \(19.0\) \(\textrm{kg}\), and the loaded sled with its rider has a mass of \(210\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

$PAR

a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration starting from rest if each dog exerts an average force of \($fa\) \(\textrm{N}\) backward on the snow. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
It may help you to draw a diagram. Upon which mass - the dogs, the sled, or both - does friction act?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationa"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the magnitude of the acceleration once the sled starts to move?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Is the dogs' acceleration the same as the sled's? 
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationb"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) Calculate the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the dogs and the sled for the first situation.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
It may help you to draw a diagram. What force is it that causes the sled to move?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$case1"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

d) Calculate the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the dogs and the sled for the second situation.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What would cause the tension force to change as the sled starts to move?
END_HINT
