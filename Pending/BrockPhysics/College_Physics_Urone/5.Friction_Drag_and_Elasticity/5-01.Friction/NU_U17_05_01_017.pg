$PAR

Consider the \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mountain climber in the above figure. 

$PAR

(a) Find the force that the mountain climber must exert with her feet on the vertical rock face to remain stationary. Assume that the force is exerted parallel to her legs. Also, assume negligible force exerted by her arms.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Draw a diagram and identify all the forces acting on the climber. Resolve those forces acting at an angle into their vertical and horizontal components. For the climber to remain stationary, what must be the net force in each direction? 
END_HINT

(b) Find the tension in the rope.

(c) What is the minimum coefficient of friction between her shoes and the cliff?
