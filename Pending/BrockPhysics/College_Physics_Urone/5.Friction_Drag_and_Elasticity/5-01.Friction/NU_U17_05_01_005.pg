$PAR

a) If half of the weight of a small \($mg \times 10^{3}\) \(\textrm{kg}\) utility truck is supported by its two drive wheels, what is the magnitude of the maximum acceleration it can achieve on dry concrete?

BEGIN_HINT
How is the normal force affected by the truck's drive wheels' only supporting half its weight?
END_HINT

$PAR

b) Will a wood cabinet lying on the wooden bed of the truck slip if it accelerates at this rate? Enter "yes" or "no":

BEGIN_HINT
What maximum acceleration can the cabinet undergo without slipping? Is this greater than the acceleration found in part (a)?
