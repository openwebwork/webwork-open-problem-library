$PAR

Calculate the maximum acceleration of a car that is heading up a \($degree^{\circ}\) slope (one that makes an angle of \($degree^{\circ}\) with the horizontal) under the following road conditions.
Assume that only half the weight of the car is supported by the two drive wheels and
that the coefficient of static friction is involved—that is, the tires are not allowed to
slip during the acceleration. (Ignore rolling).

$PAR

a) On dry concrete:

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationa"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) On wet concrete:
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$accelerationb"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) On ice, assuming that the coefficient of static friction is the same as for shoes on ice:
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For each of (a), (b), and (c), you will need to determine the appropriate coefficient of static friction. What forces (or components thereof) act on the car? How is the normal force affected, given that the drive wheels only support half of the car's weight?
