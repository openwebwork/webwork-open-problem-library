$PAR

a) When rebuilding her car's engine, a physics major must exert \($fa\) \(\textrm{N}\) of force to insert a dry steel piston into a steel cylinder. What is the magnitude of the normal force between the piston and cylinder? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
The applied force is just enough to overcome the static friction acting between the steel parts.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$Na"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is the magnitude of the force she would have to exert if the steel parts were oiled?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What parameter in the equation giving the maximum static friction force changes as the materials themselves change?
END_HINT
