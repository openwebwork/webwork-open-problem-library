## CALCLUATIONS
$forcea = ($us*$mass*$g)/(cos($rads)-($us)*sin($rads));
$accelerationa = (($forcea)/($mass))*(cos($rads)-($uk)*sin($rads))-(($uk)*($g));
$forceb = (($us)*($mass)*($g))/(cos($rads)+($us)*sin($rads));

$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

A contestant in a winter sporting event pushes a \($mass\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) block of ice across a frozen lake as shown in part (a) the above figure.

$PAR


(a) Calculate the minimum force \(\textrm{F}\) he must exert to get the block moving.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
How must the normal force change to accommodate the component of the contestant's applied force acting in the vertical direction?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$forcea"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) What is the magnitude of its acceleration once it starts to move, if that force is maintained?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What component of the contestant's applied force is responsible for accelerating the block?
END_HINT

$PAR
Suppose the contestant now pulls the block as shown in part (b) of the figure.
