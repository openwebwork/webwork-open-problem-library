$PAR

A \($ms\) \(\textrm{g}\) squirrel with a cross-sectional area of \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) falls from a \($x\)-\(\textrm{m}\)-high tree to the ground. Estimate its terminal speed. (Use the drag coefficient for a horizontal skydiver).

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the drag and gravitational forces balance when an object has attained its terminal speed.

$PAR

b) What will be the speed of a \($mp\) \(\textrm{kg}\) person hitting the ground, assuming no drag contribution in such a short distance?

BEGIN_HINT
Consider a kinematics approach to this question. What is the person's acceleration?
