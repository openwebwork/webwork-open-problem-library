Stokes's law describes sedimentation of particles in liquids and can be used to determine viscosity. Particles in liquids achieve terminal speed quickly. One can measure the time it takes for a particle to fall a certain distance and then use Stokes's law to calculate the viscosity of the liquid. Suppose a steel ball bearing (density \($dense \times 10^{3}\) \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\), diameter \($dmm\) \(\textrm{mm}\)) is dropped in a container of motor oil. It takes \($t\) \(\textrm{s}\) to fall a distance of \($d\) \(\textrm{m}\). Calculate the viscosity of the oil.

Recall that terminal velocity sets in when the weight and drag force are equal.
