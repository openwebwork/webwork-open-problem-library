$PAR

A \($ml\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) skydiver and a \($mh\)-\(\textrm{kg}\) skydiver jump from an airplane at an altitude of \($d\) \(\textrm{m}\), both falling in the pike position. Assume their cross-sectional areas are both \($A\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and calculate their terminal speeds. 

$PAR

a) How long will it take for the first skydiver with mass \($ml\) \(\textrm{kg}\) to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal speed is small)? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)

BEGIN_HINT
For both parts (a) and (b), do the skydivers continue to accelerate once they have attained their terminal velocities? What, then, should be the kinematics formula you use?
