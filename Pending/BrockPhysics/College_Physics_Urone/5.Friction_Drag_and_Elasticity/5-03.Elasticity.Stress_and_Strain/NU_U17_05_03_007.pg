As an oil well is drilled, each new section of drill pipe supports its own weight and that
of the pipe and drill bit beneath it. Calculate the stretch in a new \($Lo\) \(\textrm{m}\) length of
steel pipe that supports \($km\) \(\textrm{km}\) of pipe having a mass of \($mkgm\) \(\textrm{kg/m}\) and a \($mbit\) \(\textrm{kg}\) drill bit. The pipe is equivalent in strength to a solid cylinder \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter.

BEGIN_HINT
What <i>total</i> force serves to stretch the length of pipe? What is the Young's modulus of steel under tension?
