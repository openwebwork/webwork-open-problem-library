$PAR

A tightrope walker creates a tension of \($Tension \times 10^3\) \(\textrm{N}\) in a wire making an angle of \($degree^{\circ}\) below the horizontal with each supporting pole. Calculate by how much this tension stretches the steel wire if it was originally \($Lo\) \(\textrm{m}\) long and \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter.

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that an object stretches/compresses when subjected to a force applied normal to its cross-sectional area. Are you sure the angle the wire makes with the horizontal is relevant?
