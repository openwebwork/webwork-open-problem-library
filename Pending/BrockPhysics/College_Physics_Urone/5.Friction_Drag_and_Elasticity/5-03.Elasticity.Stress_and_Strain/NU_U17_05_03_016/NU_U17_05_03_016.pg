$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Angled Power Line."' ) \}

$PAR

The pole in the above figure is at a right angle bend in a power line and is therefore subjected to more shear force than poles in straight parts of the line. The tension in each line is \($ti \times 10^{4}\) \(\textrm{N}\), at the angles shown. The pole is \($height\) \(\textrm{m}\) tall, has a \($d\) \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter, and can be considered to have half the stiffness of hardwood. 

$PAR

a) Calculate the compression of the pole caused by the power lines (excluding the guy wire). 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What component, horizontal or vertical, of the tension in the power lines will compress the pole? What is the Young's modulus of hardwood?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$heightchange"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) Determine how far the pole bends. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
What component, horizontal or vertical, of the tension in the power lines will cause a shear deformation? What is the shear modulus of hardwood?
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$sheardeform"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) Find the tension in a guy wire used to keep the pole straight if it is attached to the top of the pole at an angle of \($degreesguy^{\circ}\) with the vertical. (Clearly, the guy wire must be in the opposite direction of the bend).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
For the pole to be held straight, there can be no net force acting in a plane parallel to its cross-sectional area.
