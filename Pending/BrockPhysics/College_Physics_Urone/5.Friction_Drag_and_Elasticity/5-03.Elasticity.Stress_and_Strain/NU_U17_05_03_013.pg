$PAR

A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) (that is, \(Î”V/V_\circ\) = \($VVo\)) relative to the space available.

$PAR

Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square metre if its bulk modulus is \($Bulk \times 10^9\) \(\textrm{N/m}^{2}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^{2}\)

BEGIN_HINT
