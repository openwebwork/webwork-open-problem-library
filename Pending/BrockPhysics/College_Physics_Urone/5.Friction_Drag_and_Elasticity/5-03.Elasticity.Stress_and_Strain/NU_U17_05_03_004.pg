TV broadcast antennas are the tallest artificial structures on Earth. In 1987, a \($mp\) \(\textrm{kg}\)
physicist placed himself and \($me\) \(\textrm{kg}\) of equipment at the top of one \($Lo\) \(\textrm{m}\) high antenna to perform gravity experiments. By how much was the antenna compressed,
if we consider it to be equivalent to a steel cylinder \($r\) \(\textrm{m}\) in radius?
