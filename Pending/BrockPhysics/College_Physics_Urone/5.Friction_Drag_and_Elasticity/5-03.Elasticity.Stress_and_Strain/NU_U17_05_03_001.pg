$PAR

During a circus act, one performer swings upside down hanging from a trapeze while holding another, also upside-down, performer by the legs. If the upward force on the lower performer is three times her weight, how much do the bones (the femurs) in each of her upper legs stretch? You may assume each is equivalent to a uniform rod \($Locm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) long and \($rcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in radius. Her mass is \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

BEGIN_HINT
You will have to determine the Young's modulus for bone under tension. What fraction of the downward force due to hanging performer's weight is supported by each of the upper performer's legs?
