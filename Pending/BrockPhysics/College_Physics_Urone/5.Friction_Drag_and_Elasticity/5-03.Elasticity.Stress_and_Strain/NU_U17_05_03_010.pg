$PAR

A disk between vertebrae in the spine is subjected to a shearing force of \($F\) \(\textrm{N}\). Find its shear deformation, taking it to have a shear modulus of \(1.00 \times 10^{9}\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\). The disk is equivalent to a solid cylinder \($Locm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) high and \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter.

BEGIN_HINT
Make sure you are using the radius, not the diameter, of the vertabrae in calculating its cross-sectional area.
