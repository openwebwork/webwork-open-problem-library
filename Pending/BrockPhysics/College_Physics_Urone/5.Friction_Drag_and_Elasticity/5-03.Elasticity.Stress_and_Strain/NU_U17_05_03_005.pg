By how much does a \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) mountain climber stretch her \($dcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter
nylon rope when she hangs \($Lo\) \(\textrm{m}\) below a rock outcropping?

BEGIN_HINT
Make sure you are using the <i>radius</i>, not the diameter, of the nylon rope in calculating its cross-sectional area. What is the Young's modulus of nylon under tension?
