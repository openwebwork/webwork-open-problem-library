$PAR

When using a pencil eraser, you exert a vertical force of \($F\) \(\textrm{N}\) at a distance of \($Locm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from the hardwood-eraser joint. The pencil is \($dmm\) \(\textrm{mm}\) in diameter and is held at an angle of \($degree^{\circ}\) to the horizontal.
 
$PAR

a) By how much does the wood flex perpendicular to its length?

Which component, horizontal or vertical, of the applied force would cause a shear deformation? What is the shear modulus of hardwood?
