During a wrestling match, a \($m\) \(\textrm{kg}\) wrestler briefly stands on one hand during a
maneuver designed to perplex his already struggling adversary. By how much does
the upper arm bone shorten in length? The bone can be represented by a uniform rod
\($Locm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in length and \($rcm\) \(\textrm{cm}\) in radius.
