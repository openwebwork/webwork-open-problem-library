$PAR

When water freezes, its volume increases by \($percent\)\(\textrm{%}\) (that is, \(Î”V/V_\circ\) = \($VVo\)). What force per unit area is water capable of exerting on a container when it freezes? (It is acceptable to use the bulk modulus of water in this problem).

BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the formula for volume deformations to make use of the given quotient? What is the bulk modulus of water?
