$PAR

The leftmost wire supporting a traffic light makes an angle \($degree^{\circ}\) below the horizontal with the top of its pole and carries a tension of \($T \, \textrm{N}\). The \($Lo \, \textrm{m}\) tall hollow aluminum pole is equivalent in strength to a \($dcm \, \textrm{cm}\) diameter solid cylinder. 

$PAR

a) How far is the pole bent to the side? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Which component, horizontal or vertical, of the tension force would cause a shear deformation? What is the shear modulus of aluminum?

$PAR

b) By how much is it compressed?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Which component, horizontal or vertical, of the tension force would compress the pole? What is Young's modulus of aluminum under compression?
