<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A flashing lamp in a Christmas earring is based on an RC discharge of a capacitor through its resistance. The effective duration of the flash is \($timeSI\) \(\textrm{s}\), during which it produces an average \($powerSI\) \(\textrm{W}\) from an average \($voltageSI\) \(\textrm{V}\).
