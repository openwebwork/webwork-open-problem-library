$PAR



A physicist at a fireworks display times the lag between seeing an explosion and hearing its sound, and finds it to be \($t \, \(\textrm{s}\). 
$PAR
a) How far away is the explosion if air temperature is \($TC ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) and if you neglect the time taken for light to reach the physicist? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$da"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Calculate the distance to the explosion taking the speed of light into account. Note that this distance is negligibly greater.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$db"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) First, find speed.
b) Recall the definition of speed to find additional time.
