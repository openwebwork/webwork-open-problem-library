$PAR



Dolphins make sounds in air and water. What is the ratio of the wavelength of a sound in air to its wavelength in seawater? Assume air temperature is  \($TC ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

ANS(num_cmp("$vratio"));

BEGIN_HINT
Refer to chapter 17 in textbook to find speed of sound in sea water and air at  \($TC ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\).
