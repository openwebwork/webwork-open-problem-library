$BR
In the clinical use of ultrasound, transducers are always coupled to the skin by a thin
layer of gel or oil, replacing the air that would otherwise exist between the transducer
and the skin. 
$BR
a) Using the values of acoustic impedance given in Table 17.5 (found in section 17.7) calculate the intensity reflection coefficient between transducer material and air.

b) Calculate the intensity reflection coefficient between transducer material and gel (assuming for this problem that its acoustic impedance is identical to that of water).

BEGIN_HINT
Is it better or worse for the ultrasound waves to be 100% reflected? Why?
