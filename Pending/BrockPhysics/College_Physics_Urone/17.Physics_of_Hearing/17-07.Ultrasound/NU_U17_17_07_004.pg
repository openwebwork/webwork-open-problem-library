<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
The time delay between transmission and the arrival of the reflected wave of a signal
using ultrasound traveling through a piece of fat tissue was \($tms \, \(\textrm{ms}\). At what depth
did this reflection occur?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$x"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember the wave is reflected, so it transverse this distance twice.
