$PAR
A dolphin is able to tell in the dark that the ultrasound echoes received from two
sharks come from two different objects only if the sharks are separated by \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\),
one being that much farther away than the other. 
$PAR
a) If the ultrasound has a frequency of \($fkHz \, \(\textrm{kHz}\), show this ability is not limited by its wavelength.

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$gamma"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If this ability is due to the dolphin's ability to detect the arrival times of echoes, what is the minimum time difference the dolphin can perceive?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{s}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$t"));

BEGIN_HINT
If the wavelength is less than \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\), the dolphin will be able to resolve two objects.
