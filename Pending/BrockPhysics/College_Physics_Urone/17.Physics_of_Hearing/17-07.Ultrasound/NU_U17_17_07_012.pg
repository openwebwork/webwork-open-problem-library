$PAR
A diagnostic ultrasound echo is reflected from moving blood and returns with a
frequency \($fs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) higher than its original \($fMHz \, \(\textrm{MHz}\). What is the velocity of the blood?
(Assume that the frequency of \($fMHz \, \(\textrm{MHz}\) is accurate to seven significant figures and
\($fs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) is accurate to three significant figures.)

ANS(num_cmp("$vb"));


BEGIN_HINT
In this problem, blood acts as both a moving source and observer.
