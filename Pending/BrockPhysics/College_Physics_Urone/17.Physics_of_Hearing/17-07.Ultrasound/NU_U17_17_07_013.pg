<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Ultrasound reflected from an oncoming bloodstream that is moving at \($vbcm \, \(\textrm{cm/s}\) is
mixed with the original frequency of \($fMHz \, \(\textrm{MHz}\) to produce beats. What is the beat
frequency? (Assume that the frequency of \($fMHz \, \(\textrm{MHz}\) is accurate to seven significant
figures.)

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that beat frequency is a difference.
