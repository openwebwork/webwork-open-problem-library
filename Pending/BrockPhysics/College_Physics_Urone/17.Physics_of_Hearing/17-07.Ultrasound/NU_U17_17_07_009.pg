<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) How far apart are two layers of tissue that produce echoes having round-trip times
(used to measure distances) that differ by \($tus\) microseconds? 

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$d"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What minimum frequency must the ultrasound have to see detail this small?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f"));

BEGIN_HINT
The distance is traversed twice in this question.
