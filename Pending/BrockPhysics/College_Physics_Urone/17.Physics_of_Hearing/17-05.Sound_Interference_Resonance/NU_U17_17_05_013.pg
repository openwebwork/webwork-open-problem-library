<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Calculate the first overtone in an ear canal, which resonates like a \($Lcm \, \(\textrm{cm}\) long tube closed at one end, by taking air temperature to be \($TC ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\). Is the ear particularly sensitive to such a frequency? (The resonances of the ear canal are complicated by its nonuniform shape, which we shall ignore.)

$PAR


\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f3"));

BEGIN_HINT
First, calculate speed. Keep in mind that the first overtone is equal to the second harmonic.
