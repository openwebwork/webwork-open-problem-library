$PAR
What beat frequencies will be present: 
$PAR
a) If the musical notes A and C are played together (frequencies of \($f2a\) and \($f1a \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) )? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fba"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If D and F are played together (frequencies of \($f2b\) and \($f1b \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) )?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fbb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a beat is created by alternating destructive and constructive interference.
