BEGIN_TEXT

<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
A “showy” custom-built car has two brass horns that are supposed to produce the
same frequency but actually emit \($f1\) and \($f2 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\). What beat frequency is
produced?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a beat is created by alternating destructive and constructive interference.
