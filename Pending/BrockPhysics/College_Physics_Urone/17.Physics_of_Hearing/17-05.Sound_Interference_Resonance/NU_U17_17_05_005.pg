<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) What is the fundamental frequency of a \($L \, \(\textrm{m}\) long tube, open at both ends, on
a day when the speed of sound is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the frequency of its second harmonic?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a tube which is open at both ends has an anti-node on each side.
