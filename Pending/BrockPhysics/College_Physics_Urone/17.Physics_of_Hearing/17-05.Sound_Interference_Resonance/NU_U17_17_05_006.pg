$PAR
If a wind instrument, such as a tuba, has a fundamental frequency of \($f1 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\), what
is its first overtone? It is closed at one end. (The overtones of a real tuba are
more complex than this example, because it is a tapered tube.)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f3"));

BEGIN_TEXT
What is its second overtone?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f5"));

BEGIN_TEXT
What is its third overtone?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f7"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that a tube with a closed end will have an anti-node at the open end and a node at the closed end. Wavelengths of order 1/4, 3/4, 5/4, etc. can therefore fit inside such a tube.
