<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What is the first overtone of a bassoon that has a fundamental frequency of \($f1 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\)? It is open at both ends. (The overtones of a real bassoon are more complex than this example, because its double reed makes it act more like a tube closed at one end.)
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
What is its second overtone?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f3"));

BEGIN_TEXT
What is its third overtone?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$f4"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that the first overtone is equal to the second harmonic.
