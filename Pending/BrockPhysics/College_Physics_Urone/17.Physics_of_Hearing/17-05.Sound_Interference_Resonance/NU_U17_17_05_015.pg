$PAR
a) Students in a physics lab are asked to find the length of an air column in a tube
closed at one end that has a fundamental frequency of \($f1 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\). They hold the tube
vertically and fill it with water to the top, then lower the water while a \($f1 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) tuning
fork is rung and listen for the first resonance. What is the air temperature if the
resonance occurs for a length of \($L \, \(\textrm{m}\)? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$T"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) At what length will they observe the second resonance (first overtone)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Lb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that first resonance is fundamental.
