$PAR
By what fraction will the frequencies produced by a wind instrument change when air
temperature goes from \($T2C ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\) to \($T1C ^{\circ}\(\textrm{C}\)? That is, find the ratio of the frequencies at those temperatures.
$BR

ANS(num_cmp("$T"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that frequency is directly proportional to speed.
