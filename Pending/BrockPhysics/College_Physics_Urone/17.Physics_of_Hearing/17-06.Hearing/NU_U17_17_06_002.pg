<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
The frequencies to which the ear responds vary by a factor of \(10^{3}\). Suppose the
speedometer on your car measured speeds differing by the same factor of \(10^{3}\), and
the greatest speed it reads is \($v \, \(\textrm{mi/h}\). What would be the slowest nonzero speed it
could read?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{mi/h}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$velocity"));

BEGIN_HINT
When asked for the slowest non-zero speed, would you be required to multiply or divide?
