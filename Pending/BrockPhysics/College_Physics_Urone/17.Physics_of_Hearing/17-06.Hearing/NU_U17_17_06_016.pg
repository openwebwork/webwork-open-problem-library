$PAR
A child has a hearing loss of \(60 \, \(\textrm{dB}\) near \(5000 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\), due to noise exposure, and normal hearing elsewhere. How much more intense is a \(5000 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) tone than a \(400 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) tone if they are both barely audible to the child?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$I"));

BEGIN_HINT
Refer to graph in textbook relating phons to frequency and intensity in decibels. Recall the 0 phons line is normal hearing and that the person in question has a threshold \(60 \, \(\textrm{dB}\) above normal.
