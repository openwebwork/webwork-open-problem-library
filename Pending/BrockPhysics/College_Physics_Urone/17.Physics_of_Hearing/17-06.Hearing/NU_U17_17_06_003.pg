$PAR
What is the first closest frequency to \($f \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) that an average person can clearly
distinguish as being different in frequency from \($f \, \(\textrm{Hz}\)? The sounds are not present
simultaneously.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

BEGIN_TEXT
What is the second closest frequency?

BEGIN_HINT
Frequencies of two sounds must differ by at least 0.3% if they are to be distinguished from one another.
