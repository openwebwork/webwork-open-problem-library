$PAR
If a woman needs an amplification of \(5.0 \times 10^{12}\) times the threshold intensity to enable her to hear at all frequencies, what is her overall hearing loss in \(\textrm{dB}\)? Note that
smaller amplification is appropriate for more intense sounds to avoid further damage
to her hearing from levels above \(90 \, \(\textrm{dB}\).
