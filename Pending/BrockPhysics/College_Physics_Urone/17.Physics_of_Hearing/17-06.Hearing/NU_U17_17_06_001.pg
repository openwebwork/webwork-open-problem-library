$PAR
The factor of \(10^{-12}\) in the range of intensities to which the ear can respond, from
threshold to that causing damage after brief exposure, is truly remarkable. If you
could measure distances over the same range with a single instrument and the
smallest distance you could measure was \($dmm \, \(\textrm{mm}\), what would the largest be?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{km}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$dlarge"));

BEGIN_HINT
Considering the magnitude of the range, how large would expect the largest distance to be in comparison to \($dmm \, \(\textrm{mm ?}\)
