<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What is the difference in frequency between \($f2 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) and \($f1 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
What is 0.3% of 2002 Hz?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$p"));


BEGIN_TEXT
Can an average person tell that these are different frequencies without playing them simultaneously? Enter \(0\) for "yes" and \(1\) for "no".
$PAR
\{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$b"));


BEGIN_HINT
Their frequencies must vary by at least \(0.3%\) to be distinguishable.
