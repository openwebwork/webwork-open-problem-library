$PAR
A person has a hearing threshold \(10 \, \(\textrm{dB}\) above normal at \(100 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) and \(50 \, \(\textrm{dB}\) above normal at \(4000 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\). How much more intense must a \(100 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) tone be than a \(4000 \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) tone if they are both barely audible to this person?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{W/m}^2\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$I"));

BEGIN_HINT
Refer to graph in textbook relating phons to frequency and intensity in decibels. Recall the 0 phons line is normal hearing and that the person in question has a threshold \(10 \, \(\textrm{dB}\) above normal.
