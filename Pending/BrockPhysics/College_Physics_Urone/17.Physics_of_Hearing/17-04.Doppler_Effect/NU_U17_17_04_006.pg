<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Calculate the factor by which the frequency shifts produced when you pull a tuning fork toward you at \($vs \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) on a day when the speed of sound is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?

BEGIN_HINT
As this question asks for a multiplicative factor, you are not required to know the frequency of the source.
