$PAR



a) At an air show a jet flies directly toward the stands at a speed of \($vskm \, \(\textrm{km/h}\),
emitting a frequency of \($fs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\), on a day when the speed of sound is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\). What frequency is received by the observers? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fobs"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What frequency do they receive as the plane flies directly away from them?
$BR
$BR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fsb"));

BEGIN_HINT
How does the perceived sound change when the jet is approaching versus when it has passed? In which situation should the frequency be higher?
