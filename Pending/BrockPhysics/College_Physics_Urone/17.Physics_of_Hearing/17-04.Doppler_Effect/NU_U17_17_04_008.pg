$PAR
What is the minimum speed at which a source must travel toward you for you to be
able to hear that its frequency is Doppler shifted? That is, what speed produces a shift
of \(0.300 \, \(\textrm{%}\) on a day when the speed of sound is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$vs"));

BEGIN_HINT
The ratio of observer frequency to source frequency must be greater than or equal to 1.003.
