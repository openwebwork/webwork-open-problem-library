What frequency is received by a mouse just before being dispatched by a hawk flying
at it at \($vs \, \(\textrm{m/s}\) and emitting a screech of frequency \($fs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\)? Take the speed of
sound to be \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$fobs"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the Doppler effect. Does frequency increase or decrease when the source is approaching the observor?
