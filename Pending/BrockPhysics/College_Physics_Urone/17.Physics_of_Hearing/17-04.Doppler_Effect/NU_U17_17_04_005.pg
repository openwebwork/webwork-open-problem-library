$PAR
A commuter train blows its \($fs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) horn as it approaches a crossing. The speed of
sound is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\). 
$PAR
a) An observer waiting at the crossing receives a frequency of \($fobs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\). What is the speed of the train? 
$PAR


\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$vs"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What frequency does the observer receive as the train moves away?
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fobsb"));

BEGIN_HINT
Part (b) requires you to use the speed found in part (a).
