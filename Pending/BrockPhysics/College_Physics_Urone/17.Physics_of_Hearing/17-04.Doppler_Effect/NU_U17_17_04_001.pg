$PAR



a) What frequency is received by a person watching an oncoming ambulance moving
at \($vskm \, \(\textrm{km/h}\) and emitting a steady \($fs \, \(\textrm{Hz}\) sound from its siren? The speed of sound on this day is \($vw \, \(\textrm{m/s}\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fobs"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What frequency does she receive after the ambulance has passed?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Hz}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$fsb"));

BEGIN_HINT
How does the perceived sound change when the ambulance is approaching versus when it has passed? In which situation should the frequency be higher?
