Ear trumpets were never very common, but they did aid people with hearing losses by gathering sound over a large area and concentrating it on the smaller area of the eardrum. What decibel increase does an ear trumpet produce if its sound gathering area is \($At \textrm{cm}^2\) and the area of the eardrum is \($Ae \textrm{cm}^2\), but the trumpet only has an efficiency of \($efficiency \, \(\textrm{% }\) in transmitting the sound to the eardrum?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that \(\textrm{I=P/A}\). 
$PAR
Use this knowledge to develop a proportionality with area, where power is constant.
