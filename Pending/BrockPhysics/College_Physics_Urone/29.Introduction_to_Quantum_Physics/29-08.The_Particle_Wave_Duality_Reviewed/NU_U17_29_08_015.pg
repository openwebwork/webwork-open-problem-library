<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere has an intensity of \($intensity \, \textrm{kW/m}^2\). If this is reflected straight back from a mirror that has only a small recoil.

BEGIN_HINT
Can you first rearrange the definition of average intensity to solve for the energy transported per unit time? Recall thereafter the most general form of Newton's second law and the relationship between photon energy and momentum.

b) Very low mass mirrors can be constructed in the near weightlessness of space, and attached to a spaceship to sail it. Once done, the average mass per square meter of the spaceship is \($mass_per_areaSI \, \textrm{kg}\). Find the acceleration of the spaceship if all other forces are balanced.
