<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> One problem with x-rays is that they are not sensed. Calculate the temperature increase of a researcher exposed in a few seconds to a nearly fatal accidental dose of x-rays under the following conditions. The energy of the x-ray photons is \($energy_per_photon \, \textrm{keV}\) and \($photons_per_mass \times 10^{13}\) of them are absorbed per kilogram of tissue, the specific heat of which is \($heat_capacity \, \frac{\textrm{kcal}}{\textrm{kg} \cdot ^{\circ}\textrm{C}}\). (Note that medical diagnostic x-ray machines cannot produce an intensity this great.)
