A laser with a power output of \($laser_power \, \textrm{mW}\) at a wavelength of \($wavelength \, \textrm{nm}\) is projected onto calcium metal.

a) How many electrons per second are ejected?

Assume that there are as many electrons ejected as there are photons emitted.

BEGIN_HINT
Begin by recalling Einstein's formula for the photoelectric effect and the relationship between frequency and wavelength. How can you then solve for the power transported by the electrons, given your answer to part (a) above?

Recall the definition of average current. What charge is borne by a single electron?

BEGIN_HINT
Electrons will continue to traverse the capacitor until it proffers an insurmountable electrical potential energy (due to the increase in voltage). How can you express voltage as a function of time, recalling the definition of capacitance?
