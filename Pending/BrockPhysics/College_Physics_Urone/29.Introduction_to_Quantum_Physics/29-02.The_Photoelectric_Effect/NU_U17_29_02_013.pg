BEGIN_HINT
Recall the definition of average power. Can you first determine the energy transported by a single electron of this wavelength?

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall Einstein's formula for the photoelectric effect. What kinetic energy is possessed by a single electron? Then, given your answer to part (a) above, what power is carried away by the fusillade of ejected electrons?
