$PAR
Twin skaters approach one another as shown above and lock hands. 
$PAR
a) Calculate their final angular velocity, given each had an initial speed of \($velocity\) m/s relative to the ice. Each has a mass of \($mass\) kg, and each has a centre of mass located \($radius\) m from their locked hands. You may approximate their moments of inertia to be that of point masses at this radius. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} rad/s

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Calculate the total kinetic energy of the system.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} J

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$KineticEnergy"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that energy is conserved. Initially all of the energy in the system is kinetic translational energy. After the skaters lock hands the energy becomes rotational.
