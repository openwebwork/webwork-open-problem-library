BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
An advertisement claims that an \($masscar\)-kg car is aided by its
\($massfly\)-kg flywheel, which can accelerate the car from rest to a speed of \($velocity\) m/s. The flywheel is a disk with a \($radius\)-m radius. 
$PAR
a) Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have if \(95.0\)% of its rotational energy is used to get the car up to speed.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} rev/s

$PAR
Is this reasonable?
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$angularvelocity"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the energy systems used in chapter 7. What two types of energy must be applied here?
