$PAR
Zorch, an archenemy of Superman, decides to slow Earth's rotation to once per \(28.0\) h by exerting an opposing force at and parallel to the equator. Superman is not immediately concerned, because he knows Zorch can only exert a force of \(4.00 \times 10^{7}\) N (a little greater than a Saturn V rocket's thrust). How long must Zorch push with this force to accomplish his goal? (This period gives Superman time to devote to other villains.)

ANS(num_cmp("$time"));

BEGIN_HINT
To find the amount of time Zorch will need to slow the rotation of the Earth, first consider its inertia.
