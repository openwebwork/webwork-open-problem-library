$PAR
Unreasonable Results A gymnast doing a forward flip lands on the mat and exerts a
\($Torque\)-NÂ·m torque to slow and then reverse her angular velocity. Her initial angular
velocity is \($velocity\) rad/s, and her moment of inertia is \($Inertia \textrm{kg m}^2\). 
$PAR
a) What time is required for her to exactly reverse her spin? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} s

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$time"));

BEGIN_HINT
Applying torque to reverse the gymnast's spin will result in a stop to her rotation.
