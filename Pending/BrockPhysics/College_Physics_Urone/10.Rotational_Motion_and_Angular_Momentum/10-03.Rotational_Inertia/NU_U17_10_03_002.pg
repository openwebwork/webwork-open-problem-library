<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Calculate the moment of inertia of a skater given the following information. 
$PAR
a) The \($massa\)-kg skater is approximated as a cylinder that has a \($radiusa\)-m radius.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ia"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) The skater with arms extended is approximately a cylinder that is \($mass2\) kg, has a \($radiusa\)-m radius, and has two \($radius2\)-m-long arms which are \($mass3\) kg each and extend straight out from the cylinder like rods rotated about their ends.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$I"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that a cylinder has the same moment of inertia as a disk when rotating around its geometric centre.
