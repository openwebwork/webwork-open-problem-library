$PAR
A baseball pitcher throws the ball in a motion where there is rotation of the forearm about the elbow joint as well as other movements. If the linear velocity of the ball relative to the elbow joint is \($velocity\) m/s at a distance of \($radius\) m from the joint and the moment of inertia of the forearm is \($Inertia\) \(\textrm{kg m}^2\) , what is the rotational kinetic energy of the forearm?

ANS(num_cmp("$KineticEnergy"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that you are given the tangential velocity of the ball, not the angular velocity.
