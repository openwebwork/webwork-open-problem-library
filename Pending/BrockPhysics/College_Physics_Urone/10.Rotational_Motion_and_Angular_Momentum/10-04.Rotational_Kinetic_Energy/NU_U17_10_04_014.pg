$PAR
In softball, the pitcher throws with the arm fully extended (straight at the elbow). In a fast pitch the ball leaves the hand with a speed of \($velocitykmh\) km/h. 
$PAR
a) Find the rotational kinetic energy of the pitcher's arm given its moment of inertia is \($Inertia\) \(\textrm{kg m}^2\) and the ball leaves the hand at a distance of \($length\) m from the pivot at the shoulder. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} J

ANS(num_cmp("$KineticEnergy"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What force did the muscles exert to cause the arm to rotate if their effective perpendicular lever arm is \($radiusb\) cm and the ball is \($massb\) kg?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} N

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Force"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) Notice that the ball is included in the calculation for the kinetic energy of the arm.
$PAR
b) Assume the arm starts horizontally behind the pitcher and the ball is released at the bottom of the swing.
