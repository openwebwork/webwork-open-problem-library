BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
To develop muscle tone, a woman lifts a \($mass\)-kg weight held in her hand. She uses her biceps muscle to flex the lower arm through an angle of \($degree ^{\circ}\). 
$PAR
a) What is the angular acceleration if the weight is \($radiusw\) cm from the elbow joint, her forearm has a moment of inertia of \($Inertia\) \(\textrm{kg m}^2\), and the muscle force is \($Force\) N at an effective perpendicular lever arm of \($radius\) cm? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{rad/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$angularacceleration"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How much work does she do?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} J

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Work"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the expression torque is equal to inertia multiplied by angular acceleration refers to the net torque and inertia of the whole system.
