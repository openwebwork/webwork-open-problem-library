BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
During a very quick stop, a car decelerates at \($acceleration1 \textrm{m/s}^2\). 
$PAR
a) What is the angular acceleration of its \($radius\)-m-radius tires, assuming they do not slip on the pavement?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{rad/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$angularacceleration"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How many revolutions do the tires make before coming to rest, given their initial
angular velocity is \($angularvelocity\) rad/s? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} rev

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$theta"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) How long does the car take to stop completely? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} s

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$time"));

BEGIN_TEXT 
d) What distance does the car travel in this time? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} m

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$x"));

BEGIN_TEXT  
e) What was the car's initial velocity?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} m/s

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$velocityo"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that you do not need to answer the questions in order. For example, you can use the answer from part c to help you answer part b.
