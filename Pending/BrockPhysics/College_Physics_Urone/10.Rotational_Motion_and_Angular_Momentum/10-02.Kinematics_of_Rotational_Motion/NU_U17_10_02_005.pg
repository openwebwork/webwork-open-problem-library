BEGIN_TEXT
Everyday application: Suppose a yo-yo has a center shaft that has a \($radius\) cm radius
and that its string is being pulled. 
$PAR
a) If the string is stationary and the yo-yo
accelerates away from it at a rate of \($acceleration1 \textrm{m/s}^2\), what is the angular acceleration of the yo-yo? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{rad/s}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$angularacceleration"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the angular velocity after \($time\) s if it starts from rest?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} rad/s

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
c) The outside radius of the yo-yo is \($radiusc\) cm. What is the tangential acceleration of a point on its edge?
$PAR
