BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
a) Calculate the angular momentum of an ice skater spinning at \($angularvelocity\) rev/s given his moment of inertia is \($Inertia\) \(\textrm{kg m}^2\). 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg m}^2\)\(\textrm{/s}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$angularmomentuma"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) He reduces his rate of spin (his angular velocity) by extending his arms and increasing his moment of inertia. Find the value of his moment of inertia if his angular velocity decreases to \($angularvelocityb\) rev/s. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$MomentInertia"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) Suppose instead he keeps his arms in and allows friction of the ice to slow him to \($angularvelocityc\) rev/s. What average torque was exerted if this takes \($time\) s?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} N m

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Torque"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that \(\Delta\textrm{Inertia}\) is required to calculate the torque exerted by the ice on the skater.
