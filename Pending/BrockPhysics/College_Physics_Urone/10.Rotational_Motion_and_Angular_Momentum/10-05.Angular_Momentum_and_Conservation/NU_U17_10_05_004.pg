BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A playground merry-go-round has a mass of \($MassWheel\) kg and a radius of \($radius\) m and it is rotating with an angular velocity of \($angularvelocity\) rev/s. What is its angular velocity after a \($masschild\)-kg child gets onto it by grabbing its outer edge? The child is initially at rest.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} rad/s

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$angularmomentum"));

BEGIN_HINT
The angular momentum of the system will be the same both before and after the child jumps on to the merry-go-round.
