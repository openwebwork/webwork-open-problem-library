BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose you start an antique car by exerting a force of \($Force\) N on its crank for \($time\) s. What angular momentum is given to the engine if the handle of the crank is \($radius\) m from the pivot and the force is exerted to create maximum torque the entire time?

ANS(num_cmp("$angularmomentum"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that angular momentum can be represented in several ways.
