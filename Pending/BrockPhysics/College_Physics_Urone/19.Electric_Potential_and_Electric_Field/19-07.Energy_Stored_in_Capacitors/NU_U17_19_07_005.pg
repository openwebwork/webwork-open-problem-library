A nervous physicist worries that the two metal shelves of his wood frame bookcase might obtain a high voltage if charged by static electricity, perhaps produced by friction.

a) What is the capacitance of the empty shelves if they have area \($areaSI\) \(\textrm{m}^2\) and are \($distanceSI\) \(\textrm{m}\) apart?
