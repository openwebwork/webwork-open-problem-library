In one of the classic nuclear physics experiments at the beginning of the 20th century, an alpha particle was accelerated toward a gold nucleus, and its path was substantially deflected by the Coulomb interaction. If the energy of the doubly charged alpha nucleus was \($KEMeV\) \(\textrm{MeV}\), how close to the gold nucleus could it come before being deflected? (For reference, the size of a gold nucleus is about \(7\) \(\textrm{fm}\).)

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an equation wherein the alpha particle's initial kinetic energy is entirely converted into electric potential energy upon attaining its closest proximity to the gold nucleus? How many protons are in a gold nucleus?
