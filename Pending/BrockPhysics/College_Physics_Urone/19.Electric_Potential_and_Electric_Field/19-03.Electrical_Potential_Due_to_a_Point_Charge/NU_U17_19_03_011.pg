What is the difference in potential between two points situated \($distanceclose\) \(\textrm{cm}\) and \($distancefar\) \(\textrm{cm}\) from a \($charge \times 10^{-6}\) \(\textrm{C}\) point charge?

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for the potential difference produced at radial distances from a point charge. What is the potential at the point nearest the charge? At that farthest from it? Remember, voltage is a scalar; it is added algebraically, rather than geometrically.
