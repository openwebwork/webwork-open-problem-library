$PAR

<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A battery-operated car utilizes a \($voltage\) \(\textrm{V}\) system. Find the charge the batteries must be able to move in order to accelerate the \($mass\) \(\textrm{kg}\) car from rest to \($velocityacc\) \(\textrm{m/s}\), make it climb a \($height\) \(\times 10^{2}\) \(\textrm{m}\) high hill, and then cause it to travel at a constant \($velocityconst\) \(\textrm{m/s}\) by exerting a \($force \times 10^{2}\) \(\textrm{N}\) force for an hour.

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an equation wherein the electric potential energy generated by the battery is converted entirely into the work done by the car throughout its journey?
