$PAR

A bare helium nucleus has two positive charges and a mass of \($mass\) \( \times 10^{-27}\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

$PAR

a) Calculate its kinetic energy in joules at \($percent\) \(\textrm{%}\) of the speed of light.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{J}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall the formula for kinetic energy. What is the speed of light?
END_HINT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) What is this energy in electron volts?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{eV}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Recall that an electron volt is defined as the energy gained or lost by accelerating an electron through a potential difference of one volt.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$energyeV"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

c) What voltage would be needed to obtain this energy?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{V}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you rearrange the formula for electric potential energy to solve for voltage? What is the charge on a bare helium nucleus?
