$PAR

<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A \($voltage\) \(\textrm{V}\) battery-operated bottle warmer heats \($massglass\) \(\textrm{g}\) of glass, \($masswater \times 10^{2}\) \(\textrm{g}\) of baby formula, and \($massalu \times 10^{2}\) \(\textrm{g}\) of aluminum from \($temp1^{\circ}\textrm{C}\) to \($temp2^{\circ}\textrm{C}\). Assume the baby forumula has the same thermal properties as water.

$PAR

a) How much charge is moved by the battery?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{C}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an equation wherein the electric potential energy generated by the battery is entirely converted into thermal energy gained by the bottle-formula-aluminum system? You will have to research the components' specific heat capacities.
END_HINT

ANS(num_cmp("$charge"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

b) How many electrons per second flow if it takes \($timemin\) \(\textrm{min}\) to warm the formula?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} electrons/s

$PAR

END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Can you first use your answer from part (a) above and the given time to determine the charge moved each second (<i>i.e.</i> the current)?
