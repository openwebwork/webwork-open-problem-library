$PAR

<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Fusion probability is greatly enhanced when appropriate nuclei are brought close together, but mutual Coulomb repulsion must be overcome. This can be done using the kinetic energy of high-temperature gas ions or by accelerating the nuclei toward one another.

$PAR

a) Calculate the potential energy of two singly charged nuclei separated by \($distance \times 10^{-12}\) \(\textrm{m}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall that work, for colinear force and displacement vectors acting in the same direction, is simply the product of their magnitudes. What force does one point charge exert on the other?

b) At what temperature will atoms of a gas have an average kinetic energy equal to this needed electrical potential energy?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{K}\)

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an equation wherein the average translational kinetic energy of gas molecules is equal to the electric potential energy between two singly charged nuclei?
