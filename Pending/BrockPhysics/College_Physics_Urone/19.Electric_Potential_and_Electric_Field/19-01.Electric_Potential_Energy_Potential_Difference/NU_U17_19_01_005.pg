<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>

$PAR

<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> The temperature near the center of the Sun is thought to be 15 million degrees Celsius. Through what voltage must a singly charged ion be accelerated to have the same energy as the average kinetic energy of ions at this temperature?

BEGIN_HINT
Can you devise an equation wherein the average translational kinetic energy of gas molecules is equal to the electric potential energy had by single-charged ions accelerated through the desired voltage?
