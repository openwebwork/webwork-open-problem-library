$PAR

Find the ratio of speeds of an electron and a negative hydrogen ion (one having an extra electron) accelerated through the same voltage, assuming non-relativistic final speeds. Take the mass of the hydrogen ion to be \($mass \times 10^{-27}\) \(\textrm{kg}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the law of conservation of energy. Can you write an equation for each particle wherein their initial electric potential energy is converted entirely into kinetic energy?
