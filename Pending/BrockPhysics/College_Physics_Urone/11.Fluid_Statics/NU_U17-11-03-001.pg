$PAR

As a woman walks, her entire weight is momentarily placed on one heel of her high-heeled shoes. Calculate the pressure exerted on the floor by the heel if it has an area of \($area \, \(\textrm{cm}^3\)  and the woman's mass is \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\). Express the pressure in \(\textrm{Pa}\) where \(1\, \(\textrm{Pa}\) = \(1 \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\).  (In the early days of commercial flight, women were not allowed to wear high-heeled shoes because aircraft floors were too thin to withstand such large pressures.)
