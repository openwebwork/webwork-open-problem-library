Pressure cookers have been around for more than 300 years, although their use has strongly declined in recent years (early models had a nasty habit of exploding). How much force must the latches holding the lid onto a pressure cooker be able to withstand if the circular lid is \($area \, \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter and the gauge pressure inside is \($pressure \, \(\textrm{atm}\)? Neglect the weight of the lid.
