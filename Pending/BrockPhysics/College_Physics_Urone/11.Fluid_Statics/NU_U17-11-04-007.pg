<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What pressure is exerted on the bottom of a \($width \, \(\textrm{m}\) wide by \($length \, \(\text{m}\) long gas tank that can hold \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) of gasoline by the weight of the gasoline in it when it is full?
