$PAR
A straightforward method of finding the density of an object is to measure its mass and then measure its volume by submerging it in a graduated cylinder. What is the density of a \($mass \, \(\textrm{g}\) rock that displaces \($volume \, \(\textrm{cm}^3\) of water? (Note that the accuracy and practical applications of this technique are more limited than a variety of others that are based on Archimedes' principle.)

BEGIN_HINT
