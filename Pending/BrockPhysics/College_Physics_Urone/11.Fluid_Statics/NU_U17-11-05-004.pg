$PAR



A certain hydraulic system is designed to exert a force \($force\) times as large as the one put into it.

$PAR

a) What must be the ratio of the area of the slave cylinder to the area of the master cylinder?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What must be the ratio of their diameters?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) By what factor is the distance through which the output force moves reduced relative to the distance through which the input force moves? Assume no losses to friction.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
a) Equate pressures of master and slave cylinders, then rearrange,
$PAR
b) Remember if variable is squared, you must take its square root.
$PAR
c) Equate work done for master and slave cylinders.
