$PAR
What is the density of  \(18.0\) -karat gold that is a mixture of \( 18 \) parts gold, \( 5 \) parts silver, and \(1\)  part copper? (These values are parts by mass, not volume.) Assume that this is a simple mixture having an average density equal to the weighted densities of its constituents. The density of gold is \( 19.32 \, \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\), silver is \( 10.1 \, \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\) and copper is \( 8.8 \, \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\) 
$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Use the individual densities of constituent metals to help you calculate total volume.
