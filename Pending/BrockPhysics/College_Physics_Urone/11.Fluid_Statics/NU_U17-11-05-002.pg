$PAR



What force must be exerted on the master cylinder of a hydraulic lift to support the weight of a \($weight \, \(\textrm{kg}\) car (a large car) resting on the slave cylinder? The master cylinder has a \($d1 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter and the slave has a \($d2 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the ratio of pressures between the master and slave cylinders.
