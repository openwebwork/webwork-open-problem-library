<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR

A trash compactor can reduce the volume of its contents to \($volume \) times their original value. Neglecting the mass of air expelled, by what factor is the density of the rubbish increased?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{times denser}\)

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the ratio between the new and initial densities.
