<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
a) Calculate the pressure due to the ocean at the bottom of the Marianas Trench near the Philippines, given its depth is \(11 \, \(\textrm{km}\) and assuming the density of sea water is \(1025 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\) and is constant all the way down. There is \(1 \, \(\textrm{atm}\) per \(101300 \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{atm}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Calculate the percent decrease in volume of sea water due to such a pressure, assuming its bulk modulus is \(2.2 \times 10^{9} \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) and is the same as water and is constant.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{%}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What would be the ratio of change in density to initial density?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Part (c) - Use the definition of density to create a ratio where terms can be divided out.
