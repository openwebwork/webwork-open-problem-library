<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
You can chew through very tough objects with your incisors because they exert a large force on the small area of a pointed tooth. What pressure in pascals can you create by exerting a force of \($force \, \(\textrm{N}\) with your tooth on an area of \($area \, \(\textrm{mm}^2\)?

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to convert millimeters squared to meters squared.
