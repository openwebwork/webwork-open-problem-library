$PAR
A rectangular gasoline tank can hold \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) of gasoline when full. What is the depth of the tank if it is \($width \, \(\textrm{m}\) wide by \($length \, \(\textrm{m}\) long? The density of gasoline is \(0.680 \times 10^{3} \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\).

$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Have you considered which variables are used to calculate the volume of the tank? Can these variables be related to density?
