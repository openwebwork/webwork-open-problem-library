<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
You are pumping up a bicycle tire with a hand pump, the piston of which has a \($r\) \(\textrm{cm}\) radius. What force in newtons must you exert to create a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{5}\) \(\textrm{Pa}\).  

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)
