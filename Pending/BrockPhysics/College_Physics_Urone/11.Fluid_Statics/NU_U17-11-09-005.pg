<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Gauge pressure in the fluid surrounding an infant's brain may rise as high as \($mmHg \, \(\textrm{mm Hg}\) ( \(5\) to \(12\) \(\textrm{mm Hg}\) is normal), creating an outward force large enough to make the skull grow abnormally large.
$PAR

a) Calculate this outward force in newtons on each side of an infant's skull if the effective area of each side is \($area \, \(\textrm{cm}^2\). 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the net force acting on the skull?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall Newton's Third Law.
