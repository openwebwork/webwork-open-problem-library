$PAR
A \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) man floats in freshwater with \($percent \, \(\textrm{%}\) of his volume above water when his lungs are empty, and \($percent2 \, \(\textrm{%}\) of his volume above water when his lungs are full. Calculate the volume of air he inhales—called his lung capacity—in liters.

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the difference in volume of his lungs between inhalation and exhalation.
