$PAR
The pressure inside an alveolus with a \($r \times10^{-4} \, \(\textrm{m}\) radius is \($pressure \times10^{3} \, \(\textrm{Pa}\) , due to its fluid-lined walls. Assuming the alveolus acts like a spherical bubble, what is the surface tension of the fluid? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the relationship between pressure and surface tension, \(\gamma\).
