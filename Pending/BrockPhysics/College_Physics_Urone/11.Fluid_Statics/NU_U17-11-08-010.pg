$PAR
Suppose water is raised by capillary action to a height of \($r \, \(\textrm{cm}\) in a glass tube.

$PAR
a) To what height will it be raised in a paraffin tube of the same radius? The paraffin tube has an angle of \(107\) degrees.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}\) 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) In a silver tube of the same radius? The silver tube has an angle of \(90\) degrees.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
It may be helpful to create a ratio using the formula for height in relation to surface tension, \(\gamma\).
