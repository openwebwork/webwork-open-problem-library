$PAR
One way to force air into an unconscious person's lungs is to squeeze on a balloon appropriately connected to the subject. What force must you exert on the balloon with your hands to create a gauge pressure of \($pressure\) cm water, assuming you squeeze on an effective area of \($area\, \(\textrm{cm}^2\)? There are \(98.1 \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) per \(1 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) of \(\textrm{H}\)<sub>2</sub>\(\textrm{O}\).
