A submarine is stranded on the bottom of the ocean with its hatch \($hatch \, \(\textrm{m}\) below the surface. Calculate the force needed to open the hatch from the inside, given it is circular and \($d \, \(\textrm{m}\) in diameter. Air pressure inside the submarine is \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{atm}\). The density of salt water is \(1025 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\).
