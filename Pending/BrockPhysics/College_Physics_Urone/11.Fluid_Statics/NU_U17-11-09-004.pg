$PAR
Heroes in movies hide beneath water and breathe through a hollow reed (villains never catch on to this trick). In practice, you cannot inhale in this manner if your lungs are more than \(60.0 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) below the surface. What is the maximum negative gauge pressure you can create in your lungs on dry land, assuming you can achieve \(-$pressure \, \(\textrm{cm}\) water pressure with your lungs \(60.0 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) below the surface?

BEGIN_HINT
What is the relationship between depth and the water pressure in your lungs?
