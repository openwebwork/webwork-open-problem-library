a) What is the density of a woman who floats in freshwater with \($percent\) % of her volume above the surface? This could be measured by placing her in a tank with marks on the side to measure how much water she displaces when floating and when held under water (briefly).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)

b) What percent of her volume is above the surface when she floats in seawater? The density of sea water is \(1025 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)
