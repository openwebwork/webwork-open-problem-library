<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Suppose you hit a steel nail with a \(0.500 \, \(\textrm{kg}\) hammer, initially moving at \($speed \, \(\textrm{m/s}\)  and brought to rest in \($d \, \(\textrm{mm}\). The surface tension of steel is \(2.10 \times 10^{11} \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\).

$PAR
a) What average force is exerted on the nail?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How much is the nail compressed if it is \($diameter\) \(\textrm{mm}\) in diameter and \($long\) \(\textrm{cm}\) long? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What pressure is created on the \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{mm}\) diameter tip of the nail?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

Consider the work done.
