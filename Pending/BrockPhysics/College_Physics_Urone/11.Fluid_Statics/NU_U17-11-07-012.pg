A certain man has a mass of \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) and a density of \($density \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)  (excluding the air in his lungs). The density of air is \(1.29 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\).

$PAR

a) Calculate his volume.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^3\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Find the buoyant force air exerts on him.
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What is the ratio of the buoyant force to his weight?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} 

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Do you expect the buoyant force to be greater than or less than his weight? Why?
