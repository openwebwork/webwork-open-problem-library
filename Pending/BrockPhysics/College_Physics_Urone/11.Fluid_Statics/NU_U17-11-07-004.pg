$PAR


If your body has a density of \($density \, \(\text{kg/m}^3\), what fraction, as a percent, of you will be submerged when floating gently in: 

$PAR

a) Freshwater?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{% of body submerged}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Salt water, which has a density of \(1027 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{% of body submerged}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider how much water is displaced when your body is floating.
