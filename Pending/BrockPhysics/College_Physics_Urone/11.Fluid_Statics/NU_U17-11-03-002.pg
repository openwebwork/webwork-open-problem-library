$PAR

The pressure exerted by a phonograph needle on a record is surprisingly large. If the equivalent of \($mass \, \(\textrm{g}\) is supported by a needle, the tip of which is a circle \($r \, \(\textrm{mm}\) in radius, what pressure is exerted on the record in  ?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)
