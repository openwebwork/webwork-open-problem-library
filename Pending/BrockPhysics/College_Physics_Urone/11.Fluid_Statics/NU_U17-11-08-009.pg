$PAR
Calculate the gauge pressures inside \($r \, \(\textrm{cm}\) radius bubbles of water, alcohol, and soapy water. The surface tensions of water, alcohol, and soapy water are equal to \(0.0728\) , \(0.0223\) and \(0.0370\) \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) respectively. 

$PAR

Water = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) 
$PAR
Alcohol = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)
$PAR
Soapy Water = \{ans_rule(20)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the relationship between radius and surface tension, \(\gamma\).
