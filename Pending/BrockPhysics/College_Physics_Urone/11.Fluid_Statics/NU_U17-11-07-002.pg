BEGIN_TEXT

<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
Logs sometimes float vertically in a lake because one end has become water-logged and denser than the other. What is the average density of a uniform-diameter log that floats with  \($percent\) % of its length above water?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Use \(1.00 \times 10^{3} \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\) as density of water.
