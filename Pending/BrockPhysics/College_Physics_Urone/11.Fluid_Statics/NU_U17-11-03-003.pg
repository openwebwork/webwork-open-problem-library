$PAR

Nail tips exert tremendous pressures when they are hit by hammers because they exert a large force over a small area. What force must be exerted on a nail with a circular tip of \(1.00 \, \(\textrm{mm}\) diameter to create a pressure of \($pressure \times 10^{9} \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\) (This high pressure is possible because the hammer striking the nail is brought to rest in such a short distance.)

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that radius is equal to half of the diameter.
