$PAR



Bird bones have air pockets in them to reduce their weightâ€”this also gives them an average density significantly less than that of the bones of other animals. Suppose an ornithologist weighs a bird bone in air and in water and finds its mass is \($mass \, \(\textrm{g}\) and its apparent mass when submerged is \($mass2 \, \(\textrm{g}\) (the bone is watertight).

$PAR

a) What mass of water is displaced?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the volume of the bone?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) What is its average density?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Part c requires use of values from both the bird and the water displaced.
