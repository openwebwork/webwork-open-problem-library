<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
What is the pressure inside an alveolus having a radius of \($r \times10^{-4} \, \(\textrm{m}\)  if the surface tension of the fluid-lined wall is the same as for soapy water  (\(0.0370 \, \(\textrm{N/m}\))? You may assume the pressure is the same as that created by a spherical bubble.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the relationship between pressure and surface tension, \(\gamma\).
