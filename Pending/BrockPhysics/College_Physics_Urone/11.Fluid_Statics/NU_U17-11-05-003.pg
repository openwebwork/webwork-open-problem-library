$PAR
A crass host pours the remnants of several bottles of wine into a jug after a party. He then inserts a cork with a \($d1 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter into the bottle, placing it in direct contact with the wine. He is amazed when he pounds the cork into place and the bottom of the jug (with a \($d2 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) diameter) breaks away. Calculate the extra force exerted against the bottom if he pounded the cork with a \($force \, \(\textrm{N}\) force.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N extra force}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the question asks for the difference between the two forces.
