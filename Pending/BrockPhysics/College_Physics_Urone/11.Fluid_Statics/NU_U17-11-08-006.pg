$PAR
A xylem tube is of radius \(2.50 \times 10^{-5} \, \(\textrm{m}\). Verify that such a tube raises sap less than a meter by finding \(h\) for it, making the same assumptions that sap's density is \(1050 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\), its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is \(0.0728 \, \(\textrm{N/m}\).
