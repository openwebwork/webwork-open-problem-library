$PAR
Calculate the maximum force in newtons exerted by the blood on an aneurysm, or ballooning, in a major artery, given the maximum blood pressure for this person is \($pressure \, \(\textrm{mm Hg}\) and the effective area of the aneurysm is \($area \, \(\textrm{cm}^2\). Note that this force is great enough to cause further enlargement and subsequently greater force on the ever-thinner vessel wall.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember to make appropriate unit conversions.
