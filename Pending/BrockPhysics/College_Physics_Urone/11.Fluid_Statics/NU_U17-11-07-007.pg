Archimedes' principle can be used to calculate the density of a fluid as well as that of a solid. Suppose a chunk of iron with a mass of \($mass \, \(\textrm{g}\) in air is found to have an apparent mass of \($mass2 \, \(\textrm{g}\) when completely submerged in an unknown liquid. 

$PAR

a) What mass of fluid does the iron displace? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the volume of iron, using its density of \(7.8 \, \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\)
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) Calculate the fluid's density.

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{g/cm}^3\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Use answers from part (a) and (b) to help you with part (c).
