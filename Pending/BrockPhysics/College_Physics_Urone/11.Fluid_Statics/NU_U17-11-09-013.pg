$PAR
a) To what height could such a negative gauge pressure of \($pressure \, \(\textrm{atm}\) raise water? There are \(1030 \, \(\textrm{cm H}\)<sub>2</sub>\(\textrm{O}\) per \(1 \, \(\textrm{atm}\). 

$PAR

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Assume a steel wire has an initial length of \(258 \, \(\textrm{m}\). The density of steel is equal to \(7800 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\) and the surface tension is equal to \(2.10 \times 10^{11} \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\). How much would this steel wire  stretch if suspended from above?

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
Recall the relationship between force and density. You should be able to divide out an unknown in your equation.
