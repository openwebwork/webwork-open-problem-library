$PAR
When two soap bubbles touch, the larger is inflated by the smaller until they form a single bubble. The surface tension for soap is \(0.0370 \, \(\textrm{N/m}\).

$PAR

a) What is the gauge pressure inside a soap bubble with a \($r \, \(\textrm{cm}\) radius?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) Inside a \($r2 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) radius soap bubble?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
c) Inside the single bubble they form if no air is lost when they touch?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
Use <i>total volume</i> to find the radius needed in part (c).
