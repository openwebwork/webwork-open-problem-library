$PAR



Some fish have a density slightly less than that of water and must exert a force (swim) to stay submerged. What force must an \($mass \, \(\textrm{kg}\) grouper exert to stay submerged in salt water if its body density is \($density \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)? Salt water has a density of \(1025 \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\).

BEGIN_HINT
Consider the volume of water displaced by the fish.
