<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>

$PAR
During heavy lifting, a disk between spinal vertebrae is subjected to a \($force \, \(\textrm{N}\) compressional force.

$PAR

a) What pressure is created, assuming that the disk has a uniform circular cross section \($r \, \(\textrm{cm}\) in radius?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{Pa}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What deformation is produced if the disk is \($thick \, \(\textrm{cm}\) thick and has a Young's modulus of \(1.5 \times 10^{9} \, \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_HINT
You need to rearrange the formula for Young's modulus.
