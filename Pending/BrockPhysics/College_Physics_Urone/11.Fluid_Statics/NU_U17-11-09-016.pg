$PAR

The hydraulic system of a backhoe is used to lift a load as shown above. 
$PAR
(a) Calculate the force  the slave cylinder must exert to support the \(400 \, \(\textrm{kg}\) load and the \(150 \, \(\textrm{kg}\) brace and shovel. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A1"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
 (b) What is the pressure in the hydraulic fluid if the slave cylinder is \(2.50 \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}  \(\textrm{N/m}^2\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A2"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(c) What force would you have to exert on a lever with a mechanical advantage of \(5.00\) acting on a master cylinder \(0.800 \, \(\textrm{cm}\) in diameter to create this pressure?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{N}\)

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$A3"));

BEGIN_HINT
When calculating force, do not neglect the angle of the axis upon which the force is acting.
