$PAR

There is relatively little empty space between atoms in solids and liquids, so that the average density of an atom is about the same as matter on a macroscopic scaleâ€”approximately \(10^{3} \, \(\textrm{kg/m}^3\)  . The nucleus of an atom has a radius about \(10^{-15}\)  that of the atom and contains nearly all the mass of the entire atom. What is the approximate density of a nucleus? b) One remnant of a supernova, called a neutron star, can have the density of a nucleus. What would be the radius of a neutron star with a mass 10 times that of our Sun (the radius of the Sun is \(7 \times 10^{8} \, \(\textrm{m}\))? The mass of the sun is equal to \(1.99 \times 10^{30} \, \(\textrm{kg}\).

BEGIN_HINT
a) Remember that the mass of the atom is approximately equal to the mass of the nucleus. In addition, the radius of the nucleus is 10<sup>-5</sup> times the radius of the atom. Use this knowledge to develop a relationship between the densities of the atom and the nucleus. 
$PAR
b) Use the density found in part (a). Consider the volume of a sphere.
