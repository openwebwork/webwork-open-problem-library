$Energy = 10**33;
$c = 2.998*(10**8);
$percent = random(0.06,0.08,0.01);
$percenta = $percent/100;
$mass = ($Energy/($c**2))*(1/$percenta);
$volume = $mass/1000;

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
There is approximately \(10^{34}\) J of energy available from fusion of hydrogen in the
world's oceans. 
$PAR
a) If \(10^{33}\) J of this energy were utilized, what would be the decrease in mass of the oceans? 
$PAR
Assume that about \($percent\)% of the mass of a water molecule is converted to energy during the fusion of hydrogen. 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} kg

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$mass"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How great a volume of water does this correspond to? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m}^{3}\)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$volume"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that calculating the mass converted into energy in part a) is only the mass of the hydrogen converted. You must then find the mass of the water the hydrogen was a part of.
$PAR
For part b) you must pay attention to the conversion from kg to \(\textrm{m}^3\).
