$PAR
What is the kinetic energy in MeV of a \(\pi\)-meson that lives \(1.40 \times 10^{-16}\) s as measured in the laboratory, and \(0.840 \times 10^{-16}\) s when at rest relative to an observer, given that its rest energy is \($mc\) MeV?
$PAR
Use \(\gamma\) = \($gamma\).
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} MeV

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$KineticEnergy"));

BEGIN_HINT
Not all given information is required to solve this problem.
$PAR
Recall the expression for rest energy and how it relates to the expression for total relativistic energy.
