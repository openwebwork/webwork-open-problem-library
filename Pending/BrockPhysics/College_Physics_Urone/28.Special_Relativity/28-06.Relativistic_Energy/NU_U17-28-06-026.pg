<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Nuclear-powered rockets were researched for some years before safety concerns became paramount. 
$PAR
a) What fraction of a rocket's mass would have to be destroyed to get it into a low Earth orbit, neglecting the decrease in gravity? (Assume an orbital altitude of \($radiuskm\) km, and calculate both the kinetic energy (classical) and the gravitational potential energy needed.)
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

ANS(num_cmp("$ratio"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If the ship has a mass of \(1.00 \times 10^{5}\) kg (\(100\) tons), what total yield nuclear explosion in tons of TNT is needed if it releases \(4.2 \times10^9\, \textrm{J/ton} \)?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} tons of TNT

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$massTNT"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the total energy of the rocket will be the gravitational energy plus the kinetic enerrgy.
Also notice that  \( (mv^2)/(2r) r = (GMm)/(2r) \) can be used in the calculation of kinetic energy.
