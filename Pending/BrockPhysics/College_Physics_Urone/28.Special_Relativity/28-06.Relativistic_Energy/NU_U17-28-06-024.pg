BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose you use an average of \($kWh\) kWh of electric energy per month in your home.
$PAR
a) How long would \($mass\) g of mass converted to electric energy with an efficiency of \($percent\)% last you? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} years

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$years"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) How many homes could be supplied at the \($kWh\) kWh per month rate for one year by the energy from the described mass conversion?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} homes

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$years"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the number of years you can power one house for is equal to the number of houses you can power for one year.
