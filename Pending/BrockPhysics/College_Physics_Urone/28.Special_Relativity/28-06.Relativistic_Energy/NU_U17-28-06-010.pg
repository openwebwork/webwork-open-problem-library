$PAR
A \(\pi\)-meson is a particle that decays into a muon and a massless particle. The \(\pi\)-
meson has a rest mass energy of \($Energypi\) MeV, and the muon has a rest mass energy of \($Energyu\) MeV. Suppose the \(\pi\)-meson is at rest and all of the missing mass goes into the muon's kinetic energy. How fast will the muon move?

ANS(num_cmp("$velocity"));

BEGIN_HINT
Finding \( \gamma \) first will be helpful in calculating the speed of the muon.
