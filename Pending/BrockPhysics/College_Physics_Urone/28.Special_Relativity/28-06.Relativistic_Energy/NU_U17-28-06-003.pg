$Energy1 = random(937.7,938.5,0.1);
$Energy2 = random(939,939.8,0.1);
$c = 2.998*(10**8);
$mass = ((($Energy2-$Energy1)*(1.6*(10**-13)))/($c**2))*10**30;

BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
If the rest energies of a proton and a neutron (the two constituents of nuclei) are
\($Energy1\) and \($Energy2\) MeV respectively, what is the difference in their masses in kilograms?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{-30}\) kg

ANS(num_cmp("$mass"));

BEGIN_HINT
In order to find the difference between the masses you must first find the masses of each particle, which you can do by rearranging the formula for  Einstein's first postulate of special relativity.
