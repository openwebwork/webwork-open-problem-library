BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Suppose a speck of dust in an electrostatic precipitator has \($a \times 10^{12}\) protons in it and has a net charge of \($c\) nC (a very large charge for a small speck). How many electrons does it have?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Ne"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that if an object has a negative charge it has an excess of electrons.
$PAR
Use the charge to find out how many more electrons than protons there are in the particle.
