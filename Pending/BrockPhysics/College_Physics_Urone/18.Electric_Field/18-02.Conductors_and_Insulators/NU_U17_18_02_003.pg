$PAR
A \($m\) g ball of copper has a net charge of \($b\) ÂµC. What fraction of the copper's electrons has been removed?
$PAR
(Each copper atom has \(29\) protons, and copper has an atomic mass of \(63.5\).)
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\}

ANS(num_cmp("$f"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that while the atomic mass of an atom not only gives the mass of the atom in Atomic Mass Units, but also the mass of one mole of atoms in grams.
