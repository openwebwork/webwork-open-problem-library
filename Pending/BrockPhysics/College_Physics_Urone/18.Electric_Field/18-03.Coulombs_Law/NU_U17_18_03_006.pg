BEGIN_TEXT
If two equal charges each of \($q1\) C each are separated in air by a distance of \($c\) km, what is the magnitude of the force acting between them? 
$PAR
You will see that even at a distance as large as \($c\) km, the repulsive force is substantial because \($q1\) C is a very significant amount of charge.
