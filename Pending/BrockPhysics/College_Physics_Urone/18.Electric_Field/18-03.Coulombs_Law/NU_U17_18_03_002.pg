BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Common static electricity involves charges ranging from nanocoulombs to microcoulombs. 
$PAR
How strong is the attractive force between a glass rod with a \($a\) μC charge and a silk cloth with a \(-$c\) μC charge, which are \($e\) cm apart, using the approximation that they act like point charges?
