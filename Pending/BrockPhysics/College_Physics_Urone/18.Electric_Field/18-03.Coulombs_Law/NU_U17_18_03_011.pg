BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Common transparent tape becomes charged when pulled from a dispenser. If one piece is placed above another, the repulsive force can be great enough to support the top piece's weight. Assuming equal point charges (only an approximation), calculate the magnitude of the charge if electrostatic force is great enough to support the weight of a \($a\) mg piece of tape held \($c\) cm above another.

ANS(num_cmp("$q"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that you are given the mass of the tape. You can use this to find the weight of the tape (the force being countered by the repulsion of the charged particles).
