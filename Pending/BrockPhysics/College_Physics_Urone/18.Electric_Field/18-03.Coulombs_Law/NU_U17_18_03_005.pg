$q = ($a*(10**-9))**2;

BEGIN_TEXT
How far apart must two point charges of \($a\) nC (typical of static electricity) be to have a force of \($F\) N between them?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} mm

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$r"));

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that your calculation must include the charge of both points. You must square the single charge value you are given since this is the charge of both points.
