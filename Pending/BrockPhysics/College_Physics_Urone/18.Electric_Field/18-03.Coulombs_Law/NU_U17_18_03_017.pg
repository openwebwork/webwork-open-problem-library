BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Two point charges q1 and q2 are \($r2\) m apart, and their total charge is \($q1q2\) μC
$PAR
a) If the force of repulsion between them is \($F\) N, what are magnitudes of the two charges?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} μC and \(Q_2 = 5\) μC

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$Q1a"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) If one charge attracts the other with a force of \(0.525\) N, what are the magnitudes of the two charges?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} μC and \(Q_1 = 35\) μC

$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that much of the given information in this problem is not necessary. There are two ways to solve this problem, but one involves significantly less work.
