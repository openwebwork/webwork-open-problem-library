Find the electric field at the location of \(q_a\), given that \(q_b=q_c=q_d=+2.00\,\textrm{nC}\), \(q=-1.00\,\textrm{nC}\), and the square is \(20.0\,\textrm{cm}\) on a side.

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the distance you are given is not the distance between the charged particles. You must find the distance between \(q\) and the other charged particles using the diagram and the side length of the square.
