Calculate the magnitude of the electric field at the location of charge \(q\), given that the square is \(5.00\,\textrm{cm}\) on a side and \(q=2.00\,\mu\textrm{C}\), given that \(q_a=q_b=+$A\,\mu\textrm{C}\) and \(q_c=q_d=-$A\,\mu\textrm{C}\).

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the distance you are given is not the distance between the charged particles. You must find the distance between \(q\) and the other charged particles using the diagram and the side length of the square.
