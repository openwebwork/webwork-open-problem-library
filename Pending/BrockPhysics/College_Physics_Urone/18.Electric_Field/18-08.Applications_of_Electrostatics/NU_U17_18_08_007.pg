$PAR
Calculate the angular velocity \(\omega\) of an electron orbiting a proton in the hydrogen atom, given the radius of the orbit is \($r \times 10^{-10}\,\textrm{m}\). You may assume that the proton is stationary and the centripetal force is supplied by Coulomb attraction.

BEGIN_HINT
Remember that the charge of an electron is equal to that of a proton but their masses are not.
