BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Earth has a net charge that produces an electric field of approximately \($E\) N/C downward at its surface.
$PAR
a) What is the magnitude and sign of the excess charge, noting the electric field of a conducting sphere is equivalent to a point charge at its centre? 

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} C

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("-$Qa"));


BEGIN_TEXT
b) What acceleration will the field produce on a free electron near Earth's surface? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^{2}\) (upwards)

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("-$acceleration"));


BEGIN_TEXT
c) What mass object with a single extra electron will have its weight supported by this field?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{-18}\) kg

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("-$massc"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that in order to find the electric field at the Earth's surface in this way you need the radius of the Earth.
