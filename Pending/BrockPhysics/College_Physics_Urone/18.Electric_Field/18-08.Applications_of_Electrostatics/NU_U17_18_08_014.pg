BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Calculate the electric field strength near a \($d\) cm diameter conducting sphere that has \($Q\) C of excess charge on it. 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} N/C

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_TEXT
Is this reasonable?
END_TEXT

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that you must find the radius of the sphere in order to be able to use the formula for electric field strength.
