BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
Point charges of \($q1\,\mu\textrm{C}\) and \($q2\,\mu\textrm{C}\) Î¼C are placed \($d\,\textrm{m}\) apart.
$PAR
a) At what point along the line between them is the electric field zero?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} m

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$x"));


BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the electric field halfway between them?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} N/C

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Notice that the distance between "particle a" and the point were the electric field will be zero is not the same as the distance between it and "particle b".
