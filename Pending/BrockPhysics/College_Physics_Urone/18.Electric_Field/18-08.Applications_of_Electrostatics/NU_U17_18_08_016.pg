BEGIN_TEXT
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
$PAR
A wrecking yard inventor wants to pick up cars by charging a \($d\) m diameter ball and inducing an equal and opposite charge on the car. If a car has a \($m\) kg mass and the ball is to be able to lift it from a distance of \($r1\) m: 
$PAR
a) What minimum charge must be used? 
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} C

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$q"));

BEGIN_TEXT
b) What is the electric field near the surface of the ball?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(40)\} N/C

$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("$E"));

BEGIN_HINT
Look at the values that you are given to find an appropriate expression to use alongside Newton's second law in order to find the charge of the ball.
