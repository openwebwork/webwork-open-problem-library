BEGIN_TEXT
a) A particle and its antiparticle are at rest relative to an observer and annihilate
(completely destroying both masses), creating two rays of equal energy. What is
the characteristic \(\gamma\)-ray energy you would look for if searching for evidence of proton antiproton annihilation? (The fact that such radiation is rarely observed is evidence
that there is very little antimatter in the universe.)
