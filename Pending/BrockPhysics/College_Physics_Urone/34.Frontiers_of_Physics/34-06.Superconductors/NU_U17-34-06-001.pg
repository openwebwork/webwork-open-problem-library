BEGIN_TEXT
A section of superconducting wire carries a current of \($Intensity\) A and requires \(1.00\) L of liquid nitrogen per hour to keep it below its critical temperature. For it to be
economically advantageous to use a superconducting wire, the cost of cooling the
wire must be less than the cost of energy lost to heat in the wire. Assume that the cost
of liquid nitrogen is $\($costnitrogen\) per litre, and that electric energy costs $\($costelectric\) per kWÂ·h. 
$BR
What is the resistance of a normal wire that costs as much in wasted electric energy as the cost of liquid nitrogen for the superconductor?
