BEGIN_TEXT
If the dark matter in the Milky Way were composed entirely of MACHOs (evidence
shows it is not), approximately how many would there have to be? Assume the
average mass of a MACHO is \(1/1000\) that of the Sun, and that dark matter has a mass
\(10\) times that of the luminous Milky Way galaxy with its \(10^{11}\) stars of average mass \(1.5\) times the Sun's mass.
