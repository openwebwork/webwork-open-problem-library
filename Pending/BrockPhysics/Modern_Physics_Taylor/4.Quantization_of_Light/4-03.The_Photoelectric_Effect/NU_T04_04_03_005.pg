BEGIN_TEXT
A typical chemical bond in a biological molecule has a strength of a few eV - let's say \(4\) eV to be specific.

a) Can low-intensity microwave radiation with a wavelength \(1\) cm break a bond, thus causing a mutation in a DNA molecule? (Very high-intensity microwave radiation, such as is found inside a microwave oven, will heat biological tissue, thus causing burn damage.)
