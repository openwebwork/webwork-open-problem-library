BEGIN_TEXT
The solar constant is the flux (energy per time per area) in radiation from the sun at the distance of the earth (\(R = 150\) million km) and has the approximate value \(1350\) W/m<sup>2</sup>.

a) What is the sun's total power output in Watts?

$BR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{26}\) W

b) About half of the sun's output is in the visible range, with average wavelength about \(550\) nm. How many visible photons are coming out of the sun per second?
$BR
$BR

\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\times 10^{44}\) photons/second

c) Estimate the number of visible photons hitting your face each second if you stand facing the sun directly. Assume that the area of your face is \(0.03\) m<sup>2</sup>.
