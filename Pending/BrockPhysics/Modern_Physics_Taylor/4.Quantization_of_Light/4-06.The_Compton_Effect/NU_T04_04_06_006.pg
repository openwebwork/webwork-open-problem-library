BEGIN_TEXT
A student wants to measure the shift in wavelength predicted by Compton's formula. She finds that she cannot measure a shift of less than \($percent\)% and that she cannot conveniently measure angles greater than \(\theta = $angle^{\circ}\). What is the longest X-ray wavelength that she can use and still observe?
