BEGIN_TEXT
Compton showed that an individual photon carries momentum, \(p = E/c\), as well as energy, \(E\). This momentum manifests itself in the radiation pressure felt by bodies exposed to bright light, as the following problem illustrates: A \(100\)-W beam of light shines for \(1000\) s on a \(1\)-g black object initially at rest in a frictionless environment. The object absorbs all the light of the beam.
