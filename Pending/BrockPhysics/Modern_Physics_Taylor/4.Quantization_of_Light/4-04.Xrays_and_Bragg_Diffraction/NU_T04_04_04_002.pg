BEGIN_TEXT
When X-rays of wavelength \(\lambda = 0.20\) nm are reflected off the face of a crystal, a Bragg maximum is observed at a glancing angle of \(\theta = 17.5^{\circ}\), with sufficient intensity that it is judged to be first order.

a) What is the spacing \(d\) of the planes that are parallel to the face in question?
