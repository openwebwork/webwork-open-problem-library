BEGIN_TEXT
The radioactive decay of certain heavy nuclei by emission of an alpha particle is a result of quantum tunneling. Meanwhile, here is a simplified model: Imagine an alpha particle moving inside a nucleus such as thorium 232. When the alpha bounces against the surface of the nucleus, it meets a barrier caused by the attractive nuclear force. The dimensions of this barrier vary a lot from one nucleus to another, but as representative numbers you can assume that the barrier's width is \(L \approx 35\) fm and the average barrier height is \(U_0 - E \approx 5\) MeV.
