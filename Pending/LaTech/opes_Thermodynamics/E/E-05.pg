## NOTES : In this problem, R-134a is being heated under isothermal 
## and isobaric conditions. There is both boundary work and heat. 
## The final state is a saturated mixture. No interpolation will be 
## required. The two necessary knowns at the beginning are the phase 
## and the temperature. For the final state, it is the pressure 
## (which stays constant) and the volume (which is given). Being in 
## US units, there is some care with unit conversion in order to get 
## the boundary work in Btu.
