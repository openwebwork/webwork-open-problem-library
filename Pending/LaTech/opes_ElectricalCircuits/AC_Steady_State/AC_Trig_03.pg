$PAR
A sine wave, $BITALIC f(t) $EITALIC , is zero and increasing at \(t = $t1\) ms, and the succeeding positive maximum of $p occurs at \(t = $t2\) ms.  Express the wave function $BITALIC f(t) $EITALIC in the following forms:

$PAR $BITALIC Make sure to carry at least 4 decimal places $EITALIC

$PAR
(a) \(C_1 \sin(\omega t + \phi)\) where \(\phi\) is positive, small as possible, and in degrees
$PAR
(b) \(C_2 \cos(\omega t + \beta)\) where \(\beta\) has the smallest possible magnitude and is in degrees
$PAR
(c) \(C_3 \cos(\omega t) + C_4 \sin(\omega t)\)
$BR
$PAR

(a) \{ ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
(b) \{ ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
(c) \{ ans_rule(40)\}
