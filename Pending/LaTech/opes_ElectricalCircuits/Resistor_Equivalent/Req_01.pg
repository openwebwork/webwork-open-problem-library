$PAR
In the circuit below, R1 = $R1 \(\Omega\) $SPACE R2 = $R2 \(\Omega\) $SPACE R3 = $R3 \(\Omega\) $SPACE R4 = $R4 \(\Omega\). An ohmmeter is an instrument that gives a value for the resistance seen between two terminals. What is the correct reading if the instrument is attached to the network in the figure given at points: (a) $String1 $SPACE (b) $String2 $SPACE (c) $String3 ?
