$PAR
The charge in a circuit element is given as \(q(t) = $X t^2 - $Y t^4\) coul. 

$PAR
Find: 

$BR(a) the total charge is accumulated at t = $T1 s
$BR(b) the maximum charge accumulated in the interval \( (0 \le t \le 4) \), and when it occurs
$BR(c) the rate charge is being accumulated at t = $T2 s. 

$PAR  
(a) \(q($T1)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} C
$PAR
(b) \(q_{max}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} C
$PAR
\(t_{max}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} s
$PAR
(c) Rate of q($T2) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
