$PAR
For a standard resistor. Find: 
$BR (a) Resistance (R) if i = -$I1 mA and V = -$V1 V
$BR (b) The absorbed power if V = -$V1 V and R = $R2 \(\Omega\)
$BR (c) The current if v = -$V2 V and the resistor is absorbing $P2 W
$BR (d) Conductance (G) if V = -$V2 and the resistor absorbs $P3 mW.
$BR

$PAR  
(a) R = \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(k\Omega\)
