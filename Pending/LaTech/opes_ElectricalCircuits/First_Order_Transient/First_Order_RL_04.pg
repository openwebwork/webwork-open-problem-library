Problem 2
$PAR
The circuit below has been in the form shown for a long time.  The switch in the circuit opens at t = 0.  Find:
$BR (a) \(i_L(0^-)\)
$BR (b) \(i_L(0^+)\)
$BR (c) \(v(0^+)\)
$BR (d) \(i_L(0.2s)\)
$BR (e) \(v(0.2s)\)

$PAR
\{ image("First_Order_RL_04.png", width=>337, height=>160, tex_size=>800) \}
$BR

$PAR  
(A) \(i_L(0^-)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
$PAR  
(B) \(i_L(0^+)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
$PAR  
(C) \(v(0^+)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V
$PAR  
(D) \(i_L(0.2s)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
$PAR  
(E) \(v(0.2s)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} V
