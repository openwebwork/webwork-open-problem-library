Problem 5
$PAR
In the circuit below, the switch has been closed for a long time and opens at $BITALIC t = 0 $EITALIC.  Find:
$BR (a) \(i_L(0^-)\)
$BR (b) \(i(t)\) for \(t > 0\)

$PAR
\{ image("First_Order_RL_08.png", width=>446, height=>230, tex_size=>900) \}
$BR

$PAR  
(A) \(i_L(0^-)\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\} A
$PAR
(B) \(i_L(t)|_{t>0}\) = \{ ans_rule(15)\} A
