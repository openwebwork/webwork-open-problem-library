Problem 1
$PAR
After being open for a long time, the switch shown in the circuit below closes at $BITALIC t = 0$EITALIC Find \(V_R(t)\) for $BITALIC t > 0 $EITALIC

$PAR  
\(V_R(t)\) for $BITALIC t > 0 $EITALIC = \{ ans_rule(15)\} V

# Tell WeBWork how to test if answers are right.  These should come in the
