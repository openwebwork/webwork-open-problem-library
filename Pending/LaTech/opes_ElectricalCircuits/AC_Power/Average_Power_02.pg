$PAR
A voltage source, \(V_s\) is connected across a \($R \Omega\) resistor.  Find the average power absorbed by the resistor if: 
$BR (a) \(V_s = $V1 \sin(200t)\) V
$BR (b) \(V_s = $V1 \sin(200t) - $V2 \cos(200t - 45^o)\) V
$BR (c) \(V_s = $V1 \sin(200t) - $V3 \sin(100t)\) V
$BR (d) \(V_s = $V1 \sin(200t) - $V2 \cos(200t - 45^o) - $V4 \sin(100t) + $V5\) V
