$PAR
In the circuit below, i1 = $I1 A and v1 = $V1 V.
$PAR (a) If \(R_L = $RL \Omega \) in the circuit below, find \(v_x\) and the power supplied by the $V1 V source.
$BR (b) Keeping \(R_L\) the same as in part (a), Transform the practical voltage source \( ($V1 V, 10 \Omega ) \) into a practical current source, and find \(v_x \) and the power supplied by the new ideal current source.
$BR (c) What value of \(R_L\) will absorb the maximum power, and what is that value of that power?
