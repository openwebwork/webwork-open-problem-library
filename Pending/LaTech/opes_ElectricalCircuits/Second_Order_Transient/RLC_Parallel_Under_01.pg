BEGIN_TEXT
A $L mH inductor, a $C \(\mu\)F capacitor, and a $R \(\Omega\) resistor are in series with a voltage source \(v_s(t)\).  The voltage source is zero prior to \(t = 0\).  At \(t = 0\), it jumps to $V V.  At \(t = 1\) ms, it drops to zero.  At \(t = 2\) ms it again jumps to $V V, and it continues in the same periodic fashion.  Find the current the source supplies at:
$BR
(a) \(t = 0^-\)
$BR
(b) \(t = 0^+\)
$BR
(c) \(t = 1\) ms
$BR
(d) \(t = 2\) ms
