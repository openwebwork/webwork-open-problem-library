BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
The circuit below has been in the condition shown for a long time.  After the switch closes at t=0, find:
$PAR
(a) \(i_L(t)\)
$BR
(b) \(v(t)\)
$PAR

\{ image("RLC_Parallel_Over_04.png", width=>422, height=>185, tex_size=>600) \}

$BR
(a) \(i_L(t)\) = \{ ans_rule(20)\} mA
$BR
(b) \(v(t)\) = \{ ans_rule(20)\} V
