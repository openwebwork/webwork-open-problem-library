$PAR
Your circuits professor has a notoriously messy desk. Scattered among the papers are random electronic components from old circuits that were half built or savaged for other projects. While rushing to get to class, your professor bumps his desk and unknowingly knocks over his cup of coffee. As he leaves, coffee spreads across some papers connecting both terminals of a $V volt battery to an LC circuit comprised of a $C pF capacitor and $L nH inductor. The serendipitous circuit creates a hum that is detected in the radio room on the 2m band, specifically at $F MHz. What must the resistance of the coffee drenched papers be for this to happen?
