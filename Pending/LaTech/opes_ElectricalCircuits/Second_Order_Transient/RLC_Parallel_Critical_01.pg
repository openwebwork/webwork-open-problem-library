BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
A parallel RLC circuit is constructed using a 1mH inductor and a 12 \(\mu\)F capacitor.
$BR
(a) Select R such that the circuit response is critically damped.
$BR
(b) If \(v_C\)(\(0^{-}\)) = 12 V and \(i_L\)(\(0^{-}\)) = 0 A, find an expression for \(v_C\)($BITALIC t $EITALIC) valid for $BITALIC t $EITALIC > 0.

$PAR

$BR
(a) R = \{ ans_rule(20)\} \(\Omega\)
$PAR
(b) \(v_C\)($BITALIC t $EITALIC) = \{ ans_rule(20)\} V\(|_{t>0}\)
