## Section 2.2: Reading questions on approximation with the derivative

Read Examples 44 and 45 and Figures 2.12 and 2.13 in the APEX Calculus textbook (version 3).

a. [@ $mc1 -> print_q() @]***  
[@ ANS( checkbox_cmp( $mc1->correct_ans() ) ); $mc1 -> print_a() @]***

b. Read Example 45.  Use the tangent line to the graph of [`f`] at [`x=3`] to approximate the value of [`f(3.01)`].

    [`f(3.01) \approx y(3.01) = `] [_____________]{"3*(3.01 - 3) + 4"}

a. Example 45 examines [`f`] near [`x=3`].  Using Example 45 as a guide, find an equation for the tangent line to the graph of [`f`] at [`x=1`] using that [`f(1) = -2`] and [`f'(1) = 4`].

    Tangent line [`y=`] [____________]{"-2 + 4(x-1)"}
