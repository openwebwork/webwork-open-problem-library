It can be shown how to approximate the number \(e\) with linear, quadratic, 
and other polynomial approximations. We use a similar approach in this activity to obtain linear 
and quadratic approximations to \(\ln(2)\). Along the way, we encounter a type of series that is 
different than most of the ones we have seen so far. Throughout this activity, let \(f(x) = \ln(1+x)\).
$PAR

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD $PAR

The tangent line to \(f = \ln(1+x)\) at \(x=0\) is \(L(x) =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$PAR
The formula \(L(x)\) can be used to appriximate \(\ln(2)\) since \(L(1) \approx f(1) = \ln(2)\). In particular,
\(L(1)=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.

$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD $PAR

The linearization of \(\ln(1+x)\) does not provide a very good approximation to \(\ln(2)\) since 1 is 
not that close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach; instead of using a 
straight line to approximate \(\ln(2)\), we use a quadratic function to account for the concavity of 
\(\ln(1+x)\) for \(x\) close to 0. With the linearization, both the function's value and slope agree 
with the linearization's value and slope at \(x=0\). We will now make a quadratic approximation 
\(P_2(x)\) to \(f(x) = \ln(1+x)\) centered at \(x=0\) with the property that \(P_2(0) = f(0)\), 
\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\), and \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\). 

	(i) Let $P_2(x) =  x - \frac{x^2}{2}$. Compute the following: $PAR

    \(P_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, this should equal \(f(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}; $BR
    \(P'_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, this should equal \(f'(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\};$BR
    \(P''_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, this should equal \(f''(0)=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.$PAR

	Now that you have shown the equalities above, use \(P_2(x)\) to approximate \(\ln(2)\) by observing that 
    \(P_2(1) \approx f(1)\). In particular \(P_2(1) =\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
    $PAR

 
    (ii) We can continue approximating \(\ln(2)\) with polynomials of larger degree whose derivatives 
    agree with those of \(f\) at 0. This makes the polynomials fit the graph of \(f\) better for more 
    values of \(x\) around 0. For example, let \(P_3(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}\). Show that 
    \(P_3(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\), \(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\), and \(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\) by completing 
    the following:
    $PAR

    \(P_3(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}; $BR
    \(P'_3(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f'(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\};$BR
    \(P''_3(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f''(0)=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.$PAR


    Now use \(P_3(x)\) to approximate \(\ln(2)\) in a way 
    similar to how you did so with \(P_2(x)\) above. In particular, \(P_3(1) = \)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
    $PAR

    \{
 #   	(iii) If we used a degree 4 or degree 5 polynomial to approximate \(\ln(1+x)\), what approximations 
 #    of \(\ln(2)\) do you think would result?  Use the preceding questions to conjecture a pattern that 
 #    holds, and state the degree 4 and degree 5 approximation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
For Part (a) the linearization of \(f\) at \(x=a\) is
\[f(a) + f'(a)(x-a),\]
so the linearization \(P_1(x)\) of \(f(x) = \ln(1+x)\) at \(x=0\) is
\[P_1(x) = 0 + \frac{1}{1+0}(x-0) = x.\]
Now
\[f(x) \approx P_1(x)\]
for \(x\) close to 0 and so
\[\ln(2) = \ln(1+1) \approx P_1(1) = 1.\]
$PAR

For the first item in Part (b), the derivatives of \(P_2\) and \(f\) are
\begin{align}
P_2(x) &= x - \frac{x^2}{2},  &  f(x) &= \ln(1+x), \\
P'_2(x) &= 1 - x,  &  f'(x) &= \frac{1}{1+x}, \\
P''_2(x) &= -1,  &  f''(x) &= -\frac{1}{(1+x)^2},
\end{align}
and so the derivatives of \(P_2\) and \(f\) evaluated at 0 are
\begin{align}
P_2(0) &= 0 ,  &  f(0) &= \ln(1) = 0, \\
P'_2(0) &= 1 ,  &  f'(0) &= \frac{1}{1+0} = 1, \\
P''_2(0) &= -1 ,  &  f''(0) &= -\frac{1}{(1+0)^2} = -1.
\end{align}
Then
\[\ln(2) = \ln(1+1) \approx P_2(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]

In the second item of Part (b), the derivatives of \(P_3\) and \(f\) are
\begin{align}
P_3(x) &= x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3} , &   f(x) &= \ln(1+x), \\
P'_3(x) &= 1 - x + x^2  , &   f'(x) &= \frac{1}{1+x}, \\
P''_3(x) &= -1+2x  , &   f''(x) &= -\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}, \\
P'''_3(x) &= 2  , &   f'''(x) &= \frac{2}{(1+x)^3},
\end{align}
and so the derivatives of \(P_3\) and \(f\) evaluated at 0 are
\begin{align}
P_3(0) &= 0 , &   f(0) &= \ln(1+0) = 0 \\
P'_3(0) &= 1 , &   f'(0) &= \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 \\
P''_3(0) &= -1 , &   f''(0) &= -\frac{1}{(1+0)^2} = -1 \\
P'''_3(0) &= 2 , &   f'''(0) &= \frac{2}{(1+0)^3} = 2.
\end{align}
Then
\[\ln(2) = \ln(1+1) \approx P_3(0) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.83.\]
