Have you ever wondered how your calculator can produce a numeric approximation for 
complicated numbers like \(e\), \(\pi\) or \(\ln(2)\)? After all, the only operations a 
calculator can really perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
the operations that make up polynomials. This activity provides the first steps in 
understanding how this process works. Throughout the activity, let \(f(x) = e^x\).
$PAR

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD $PAR

The tangent line to \(f = e^x\) at \(x=0\) is \(L(x) =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$PAR
The formula \(L(x)\) can be used to appriximate \(e\) since \(L(1) \approx f(1) = e\). In particular,
\(L(1)=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
$PAR

$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD $PAR

The linearization of \(e^x\) does not provide a good approximation to \(e\) 
since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. 
Instead of using a straight line to approximate \(e\), we put an appropriate bend in our estimating 
function to make it better fit the graph of \(e^x\) for \(x\) close to 0. With the linearization, 
we had both \(f(x)\) and \(f'(x)\) \{#'# syntax color issue\}
share the same value as the linearization at \(x=0\). We will now use a quadratic approximation 
\(P_2(x)\) to \(f(x) = e^x\) centered at \(x=0\) which has the property that \(P_2(0) = f(0)\), 
\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\), and \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\).
$PAR

    (i) Let \(P_2(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\). Compute the following: $PAR

    \(P_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, this should equal \(f(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}; $BR
    \(P'_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, this should equal \(f'(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\};$BR
    \(P''_2(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, this should equal \(f''(0)=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.$PAR

    Now that you have shown the equalities above, use \(P_2(x)\) to approximate \(e\) by observing that 
    \(P_2(1) \approx f(1)\). In particular \(P_2(1) =\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
    $PAR

    (ii) We can continue approximating \(e\) with polynomials of larger degree whose higher 
    derivatives agree with those of \(f\) at 0. This turns out to make the polynomials fit the graph 
    of \(f\) better for more values of \(x\) around 0. For example, let 
    \(P_3(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}\). Show that \(P_3(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\), 
    \(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\), and \(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\) by completing the following:
    $PAR

    \(P_3(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}; $BR
    \(P'_3(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f'(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\};$BR
    \(P''_3(0)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}, \(f''(0)=\)\{ans_rule(10)\}.$PAR

    Now use \(P_3(x)\) to approximate \(e\) in a way 
    similar to how you did so with \(P_2(x)\) above. In particular, \(P_3(1) = \)\{ans_rule(10)\}.
    $PAR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
For Part (a) the linearization of \(f\) at \(x=a\) is
\[f(a) + f'(a)(x-a),\]
so the linearization \(P_1(x)\) of \(f(x) = e^x\) at \(x=0\) is
\[P_1(x) = e^0 + e^0(x-0) = 1+x.\]
Now
\[f(x) \approx P_1(x)\]
for \(x\) close to 0 and so
\[e = e^1 \approx P_1(1) = 1+1 = 2.\]
$PAR

For the first item in Part (b), the derivatives of \(P_2\) and \(f\) are
\begin{align}
P_2(x) &= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}, & f(x) &= e^x, \\
P'_2(x) &= 1 + x, & f'(x) &= e^x, \\
P''_2(x) &= 1, & f''(x) &= e^x,
\end{align}
and so the derivatives of \(P_2\) and \(f\) evaluated at 0 are
\begin{align}
P_2(0) &= 1 , &  f(0) &= e^0 = 1, \\
P'_2(0) &= 1 , &  f'(0) &= e^0 = 1, \\
P''_2(0) &= 1 , &  f''(0) &= e^0 = 1.
\end{align}
Then
\[e = e^1 \approx P_2(1) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5.\]

In the second item of Part (b), the derivatives of \(P_3\) and \(f\) are
\begin{align}
P_3(x) &= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6} , &   f(x) &= e^x, \\
P'_3(x) &= 1 + x +\frac{x^2}{2}  , &   f'(x) &= e^x, \\
P''_3(x) &= 1+x  , &   f''(x) &= e^x, \\
P'''_3(x) &= 1  , &   f'''(x) &= e^x,
\end{align}
and so the derivatives of \(P_3\) and \(f\) evaluated at 0 are
\begin{align}
P_3(0) &= 1 , &   f(0) &= e^0 = 1, \\
P'_3(0) &= 1 , &   f'(0) &= e^0 = 1, \\
P''_3(0) &= 1 , &   f''(0) &= e^0 = 1, \\
P'''_3(0) &= 1 , &   f'''(0) &= e^0 = 1.
\end{align}
Then
\[e = e^1 \approx P_3(1) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67.\]
