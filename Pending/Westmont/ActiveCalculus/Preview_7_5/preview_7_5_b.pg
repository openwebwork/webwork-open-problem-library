Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity, a differential equation naturally arises.  In the following problem, we see such a scenario; we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.
$PAR  
Suppose that a water tank holds 100 gallons and that a salty
  solution, which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon, enters the
  tank at 2 gallons per minute.   
$PAR
(i) How much salt enters the tank each minute? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(ii) Suppose that initially there are 300 grams of salt in the tank.  How
      much salt is in each gallon at this point in time? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(iii) Finally, suppose that evenly mixed solution is pumped out of the tank at the
      rate of 2 gallons per minute.  How much salt leaves the tank
      each minute? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(iv) What is the total rate of change in the amount of salt in
      the tank? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
