BEGIN_TEXT
A student with a third floor dormitory window 32 feet off the
ground tosses a water balloon straight up in the air with an initial velocity
of 16 feet per second.  It turns out that the instantaneous velocity of the water balloon is given by
the velocity function \(v(t) = $vel \), where \(v\) is measured in feet per
second and \(t\) is
measured in seconds.
$PAR

Let \(s(t)\) represent the height of the water balloon above the ground at time
\(t\), and
note that \(s\) is an antiderivative of \(v\). That is, \(v\) is the derivative
of \(s\): \(s'(t) = v(t)\).
Find a formula for \(s(t)\) that satisfies the initial condition that the balloon is tossed
from \(32\) feet above ground. In other words, make your formula for \(s\) satisfy
\(s(0) = 32\). $BR
\(s(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR

At what time does the water balloon reach its maximum height?
$BR
\(t = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$PAR
 
At what time
does the water balloon land?
$BR
\(t = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$PAR
Compute the three differences: $BR
\(s\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-s(0) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} $BR
\(s(2)-s\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} $BR
\(s(2)-s(0) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} $BR
What do these differences represent?
$BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
What is the total vertical distance traveled by the water balloon from the time it is
tossed until the time it lands? $BR
Total vertical distance = \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR

The graph of the velocity function \(y=v(t)\) on the interval \([0,2]\) is
shown below.

What
is the total net signed area bounded by \( y = v(t) \) and the \(t\)-axis on
\([0,2]\)? You
can find the answer to
this question in two ways: by using your work above, or by using a
familiar geometric formula to compute areas of certain relevant regions.

Total net signed area = \{ ans_rule(10) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The function \(s(t) = $pos\) is an antiderivative of \(v(t)\) that satisfies
\(s(0) = 32\). This funciton has a maximum at \(t=1/2\), so that is when the
balloon reaches its maximum height. There is a \(t\)-intercept of \(y=s(t)\) at
\(t=2\), so that is when the balloon hits the ground. The difference 
\(s\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-s(0) = $dup \) is the change in position as it travels on the
way up. The difference \(s(2)-s\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = $ddown \) is the
change in position as it travels on the way down. The difference \(s(2)-s(0) =
$dnet \) is change in position from the time it
is released until the time it hits the ground, which is the same as the net
signed area. The total vertical distance is
\($totvd\). Notice that th net signed area could also be computed by measuring
the signed area of the triangles: \(4\) and \(-36\).
