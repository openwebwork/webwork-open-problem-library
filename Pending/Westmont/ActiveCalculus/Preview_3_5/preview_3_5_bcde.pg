This problem will lead you through the steps to answer this question: $BR
A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic
inches per second. How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the
balloon's diameter is 12 inches? Is the radius changing more rapidly when \(d =
12\) or when
\(d = 16\)? Why? $PAR

Draw several spheres with different radii, and observe that as volume changes, the
radius, diameter, and surface area of the balloon also change. Recall that the volume 
of a sphere of radius \(r\) is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).
Note that in the
setting of this problem, both \(V\) and \(r\) are changing as time \(t\) changes, 
and thus
both \(V\) and \(r\) may be viewed as implicit functions of \(t\), 
with respective derivatives
\(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\). $BR
Differentiate both sides of the equation 
\(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\)
with respect to \(t\) (using the chain
rule on the right) to find a formula for 
\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)
that depends on both \(r\) and 
\(\frac{dr}{dt}\). $BR
\(\displaystyle{\frac{dV}{dt} = }\) \{ ans_rule(25) \} 
$PAR

At this point in the problem, by differentiating we have "related the rates" of
change of \(V\) and \(r\). Recall that we are given in the problem that the balloon is
being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. To which
derivative does this rate correspond? 
$BR
\{ $mc1->buttons() \}
$PAR

From the above discussion, we know the value of \(\frac{dV}{dt}\)
at every value of \(t\). Next, observe that
when the diameter of the balloon is 12, we know the value of the radius. In the
equation \(\displaystyle{\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}} \), 
substitute these values for the relevant quantities and solve
for the remaining unknown quantity, which is
\(\frac{dr}{dt}\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Using the chain rule and differentiating with respect to \(t\) gives 
\(\displaystyle{\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}} \). Since \(dV/dt =
20\), we can use the values \(r=6\) and \(r=8\) in this equation to obtain 
the solutions \(dr/dt = $drdt12 \) and \(dr/dt = $drdt16 \), respectively. So
the radius changes more rapidly when \(d=12\).
