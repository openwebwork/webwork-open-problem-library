BEGIN_TEXT
The equation \(y = \frac{9}{5}(x - 32)\)  relates a temperature given in \(x\)
degrees Fahrenheit to the corresponding temperature \(y\) measured in degrees Celcius.
Let \(F(y)\) be the
function that converts a temperature given in \(y\) degrees Celcius to the temperature
\( F(y)\) measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Give a formula for
\(F(y)\). $BR
\(F(y) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PAR

What is the value of \(C'(x)\)? $BR
\(C'(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PAR

What is the value of \(F'(y)\)? $BR
\(F'(y) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PAR

How do \(C'(x)\) and \(F'(y)\) appear to be related? $BR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Solving for \(x\) in terms of \(y\) gives \(F(y) = \frac{5}{9}y+32 \). The derivatives
of \(F(y)\) and \(C(x)\) are \(\frac{5}{9}\) and \(\frac{9}{5}\), respectively.
These are reciprocals.
