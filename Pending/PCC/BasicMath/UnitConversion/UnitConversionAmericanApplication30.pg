BEGIN_PGML

A car moved forward [`[$ydForward]`] yards, stopped, and then backed off [`[$ftBackward]`] feet. How far was the car from the starting point? Answer the question in both yards and feet.

----

*Question 1:* The car was [_________]{$ansFt} feet from the starting point.

----

*Question 2:* The car was [_________]{$ansYd} yards from the starting point. Use fractions in your answer. Don't use decimal.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use the formula [` 1 \text{ yard} = 3 \text{ feet} `].

####Question 1:

We need to change the length of [`[$ydForward]`] yards into feet:

    [`` [$ydForward] \text{ yd} = [$ydForward] \cdot 3 \text{ ft} = [$ftForward] \text{ ft} ``]

Since the car moved backward [`[$ftBackward]`] feet, we use subtraction to find the difference:

    [`` [$ftForward] \text{ ft} - [$ftBackward] \text{ ft} = [$ansFt] \text{ ft} ``]

*Solution:* The car was [`[$ansFt]`] feet from the starting point.

####Question 2:

We need to change [`[$ftBackward]`] feet into yards:

    [`` [$ftBackward] \text{ ft} = \frac{[$ftBackward]}{3} \text{ yd} = [$ydBackward] \text{ yd} ``]

Next, we use subtraction to find the leftover:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$ydForward] \text{ yd} - [$ydBackward] \text{ yd} 
      &= [$ydForward]- [$int] - \frac{[$num]}{[$den]} \\
      &= [$ydForward-$int] - \frac{[$num]}{[$den]} \\
      &= [$ansYd] \text{ yd} 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The car was [`[$ansYd]`] yards from the starting point.
