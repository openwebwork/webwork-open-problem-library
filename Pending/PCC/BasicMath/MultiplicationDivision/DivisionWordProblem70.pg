BEGIN_PGML

A queen termite produces [`[$numPerWeek]`] eggs every week. How many eggs does the queen produce every minute?

*Solution:* The queen termite produces [__________]{$numPerMinute} eggs every minute.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It's given that the queen termite produces [`[$numPerWeek]`] eggs every week. There are [`7`] days in a week, so the queen termite can produce [` [$numPerWeek] \div 7 = [$numPerDay] `] eggs every day.

There are [`24`] hours in a day, so the queen termite can produce [` [$numPerDay] \div 24 = [$numPerHour] `] eggs every hour.

There are [`60`] minutes in an hour, so the queen termite can produce [` [$numPerHour] \div 60 = [$numPerMinute] `] eggs every minute.

*Solution:* The queen termite can produce [` [$numPerMinute] `] eggs every minute.
