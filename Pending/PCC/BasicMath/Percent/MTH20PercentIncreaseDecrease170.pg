BEGIN_PGML

A sweater is on sale for [`[$per]%`] off. The sale price is [`[$newC]`]. What is the original price?

    The original price was [_____________]{$ansC}.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The sweater's original price corresponds to [`100%`]. It's given that the price decreased by [`[$per]%`]. This implies the sweater's new price is [`100%-[$per]%=[$newPer]% `] of the original price.

Now, this problem can be boiled down to this question: [`[$new]`] is [` [$newPer]% `] of what? We will show two methods to solve this problem.

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [` [$newPer]% `] of [` x `] is [`[$new]`], so "[`[$newPer]`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$new]`] out of [`x`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$newPer]}{100} &= \frac{[$new]}{x} \\
   [$newPer]x &= 100 \cdot [$new] \\
   [$newPer]x &= [$new*100] \\
   \frac{[$newPer]x}{[$newPer]} &= \frac{[$new*100]}{[$newPer]} \\
   x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The sweater's original price was [`[$ansC]`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem. This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \iff 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

The question is: [`[$new]`] is [` [$newPer]% `] of what? Assume [`[$new]`] is [` [$newPer]% `] of [`x`]. We have:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}
        [$new]  & = [$newDec] \cdot x \\
        \frac{[$new]}{[$newDec]} & = \frac{[$newDec]x}{[$newDec]} \\
        [$ans] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The sweater's original price was [`[$ansC]`].

####Method 3  

In the sentence "[`[$new]`] is [` [$newPer]% `] of what,"

* [`[$new]`] is the *percentage*,
* [` [$newPer]% `] is the *rate*,
* "what" is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} `], we do a division to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} = \frac{[$new]}{[$newPer]%} = \frac{[$new]}{[$newPer/100]} = [$ans] ``]

*Solution:* The sweater's original price was [`[$ansC]`].
