BEGIN_PGML

A county has [`[$whole]`] residents. In the last election, [`[$part]`] of them turned out to vote. What percent of the county's residents voted?

Fill in the blank with a percent.

*Solution:* In the last election, [__________]{$perP} of the county's residents turned out to vote.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

This problem can be boiled down to this question: [`[$part]`] is what percent of [`[$whole]`]? We will show multiple methods to solve this problem.

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem.

Assume [`[$part]`] is [`x%`] of [` [$whole] `], so "[`x`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$part]`] out of [`[$whole]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{100} &= \frac{[$part]}{[$whole]} \\
   [$whole]x &= [$part] \cdot 100 \\
   [$whole]x &= [$part*100] \\
   \frac{[$whole]x}{[$whole]} &= \frac{[$part*100]}{[$whole]} \\
   x &= [$per]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* In the last election, [`[$per]%`] of the county's residents turned out to vote.

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem.

This translation from English to may  should help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \Longleftrightarrow 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

Assume [`[$part]`] is [`x`] (as a percent) of [` [$whole] `]. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$part] &= x \cdot [$whole] \\
  \frac{[$part]}{[$whole]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$whole]}{[$whole]} \\  
  [$per/100] &= x\\
  x &= [$per]%
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* In the last election, [`[$per]%`] of the county's residents turned out to vote.

####Method 3  

In the sentence "[`[$part]`] is what percent of [` [$whole] `],"

* [`[$part]`] is the *percentage*,
* "what percent" is the *rate*,
* [` [$whole] `] is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{rate} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{base}} `], we do a division to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{rate} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{base}} = \frac{[$part]}{[$whole]} = [$per/100] = [$per]% ``]

*Solution:* In the last election, [`[$per]%`] of the county's residents turned out to vote.
