BEGIN_PGML

Last year, [$name] purchased a house at the cost of [`[$originalC]`]. The house market has been very stable in the past year. This year, the value of the house increased slightly to [`[$newC]`]. What is the percentage increase of the house value?

Fill in blank with a percent. Round your answer to two decimal places, like [`1.23%`].

*Solution:* The percentage increase of the house value is [________]{$ans}.

$s1 = $new/$original;
$s2 = $s1*100;
$s3 = $per + 100;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To calculate the percentage increase/decrease, first we find the amount of increase/decrease by doing a simple subtraction calculation, 
and then we find the percentage increase/decrease.

In this problem, the amount of increase is [`[$newC]-[$originalC]=[$increaseC]`].

Since [$name]'s pay rate was initially [`[$originalC]`], we need to ask: [`[$increase]`] is what percent of [`[$original]`]?

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem.

Assume [`[$increase]`] is [`x%`] of [` [$original] `], so "[`x`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$increase]`] out of [`[$original]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{100} &= \frac{[$increase]}{[$original]} \\
   [$original]x &= [$increase] \cdot 100 \\
   [$original]x &= [$increase*100] \\
   \frac{[$original]x}{[$original]} &= \frac{[$increase*100]}{[$original]} \\
   x &\approx [$decIncNotRounded*100] \\
   x &\approx [$per]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* The percentage increase in the house value was approximately [`[$per]%`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem.

This translation from English to may  should help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \Longleftrightarrow 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

Let the increase [`[$increase]`] be [`x`] (as a percent) of [`[$original]`]. That means:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$increase]   &= x \cdot [$original] \\
  \frac{[$increase]}{[$original]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$original]}{[$original]} \\
  [$decIncNotRounded]       &\approx  x\\
  x &\approx  [$per]%\\
\end{aligned}
`]

*Solution:* The percentage increase in the house value was approximately [`[$per]%`].

####Method 3  

We first divide the "new number" by the "original number":

    [`` \frac{[$new]}{[$original]} \approx [$s1] \approx [$s3]% ``]

So the new number is approximately [`[$s3]%`] of the original number, implying the percentage increase is approximately [` [$s3]% - 100% = [$per]% `].

*Solution:* The percentage increase in the house value was approximately [`[$per]%`].
