Find a formula for a rational function [`f`] that might have this graph. Do not over-complicate things: assume that all degrees are as small as can be compatible with this graph.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We need to see from the graph that there are zeros at [`[@$r[0]@]`] and [`[@$r[3]@]`]. 

We also need to see that there are vertical asymptotes at [`[@$r[1]@]`] and [`[@$r[2]@]`]. Since the arms of the function go in opposite directions (one up, one down) as [`x`] approaches either of these, then the degree of the vertical asymptotes must be odd: [`1`], [`3`], [`5`], etc. 

Since this is a rational function, having zeros at [`[@$r[0]@]`] and [`[@$r[2]@]`] means that [`(x-[@$r[0]@])`] and [`(x-[@$r[2]@])`] are factors of the numerator. 

Having vertical asymptotes at [`[@$r[1]@]`] and [`[@$r[2]@]`] means that [`(x-[@$r[1]@])`] and [`(x-[@$r[2]@])`] are factors of the denominator. 

So far, this tells us that [`f(x)=c\frac{(x-[@$r[0]@])^m(x-[@$r[3]@])^n}{(x-[@$r[1]@])^p(x-[@$r[2]@])^q}`] for some constant [`c`] and some whole number exponents [`m`], [`n`], [`p`], and [`q`]. The instructions say that we should make the exponents as small as is compatible with the graph, and letting them all be [`1`] is compatible with the graph. 

So then we know that  [`f(x)=c[$p]`]. The long term-behavior (horizontal asymptote) is the line [`y=c`] since the total degree of the numerator equals the total degree of the denominator. We can see in the graph that whatever [`c`] is, it is positive. You can enter any formula that has this pattern to get credit for this problem, including just [`[$p]`] (where [`c=1`]).
