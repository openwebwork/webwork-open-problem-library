BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

All of the graphs have a zero at [`x=0`], but the green graph turns around at [`x=0`] and looks like a parabola if we zoomed in. So the green graph must be the graph of [`f`] with [`f(x) = \frac{x^2}{5(x+1)}`]. As further confirmation, the gren graph has a vertical asymptote at [`x=-1`], and this is evident from the factor of [`(x+1)`] in the denominator.

The red graph has [`x=1`] as a vertical asymptote, so the corresponding function would have [`(x-1)`] as a factor of its denominator. So the red graph must be the graph of [`f`] with [`f(x)=\frac{x}{x-1}`].

The yellow graph must be the remaining function, [`f`] with [`f(x)=x/(x^2+1)`]. As confirmation, note that there are no zeros for this function's denominator, and there are no vertical asymptotes in the graph.
