###Simplifying Function and Locating Hole(s)

This function cannot be simplified, and thus has no hole.

###Finding [`X`]-Intercept(s) and [`Y`]-Intercept

The function's [`y`]-intercept is at [`f(0)=[$yInt]`]. By solving for [`x`] in [`[$f[0]]=0`], we can see the function's [`x`]-intercept is at [`[$xInt]`].

###Finding Vertical and Horizontal Asymptote(s)

By the denominator [`[$den]`], we can tell the function has two vertical asymptotes at [`x=[$x1N]`] and [`x=[$x2N]`].

The degree of the numerator is [`2`], while the degree of the denominator, [`[$den]=x^2+\ldots`], is also [`2`]. This implies the function's horizontal asymptote is determined by the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   f(x) &= [$f[1]] \\
   &= [$s1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The function's horizontal asymptote is [`y=[$s2]=[$k]`].

###Locating Where the Function Intersects its Horizontal Asymptote

Next, we need to find where the function's graph intersects with its horizontal asymptote. We set [`f(x)=[$k]`] and then solve for [`x`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   f(x) &= [$f[0]] \\
   [$k] &= [$f[0]] \\
   [$k] \cdot [$den] &= [$f[0]] \cdot [$den] \\
   [$k]([$s11]) &= [$num] \\
   [$k]x^2+[$s7]x+[$s8] &= [$num] \\
   [$s7]x+[$s8] &= 0 \\
   [$s7]x &= [$s9] \\
   x &= [$s10]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The result shows the function's graph intersects with its horizontal asymptote at [`([$s10],[$k])`].

###Determining the Function's Behavior When [`X`]-Value Approaches Negative Infinity

We need to know whether the function approaches [`y=[$k]`] from above or below when its [`x`]-value approaches negative infinity. We can do this by substituting [`x=-10`] (or a similarly small number) into [`f(x)`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   f(x) &= [$f[0]] \\
   &= [$s3] \\
   &= [$s4]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The result implies the function's value approaches [`y=[$k]`] from below when its [`x`]-value approaches negative infinity.

###Sketching the Function's Graph

The following is an analysis of the function's graph.

* The function's graph approaches [`y=[$k]`] from below when its [`x`]-value approaches negative infinity.
* As [`x`]-value increases, the function curves up and crosses its horizontal asymptote at [`([$s10],[$k])`], and then approaches positive infinity as [`x`]-value approaches [`[$x2]`] from the left.
* In the denominator, the power of [`(x-[$x2])`] is [`1`], implying the function's graph approaches opposite infinities at both sides of [`x=[$x2]`]. The function's graph approaches negative infinity as [`x`]-value approaches [`[$x2]`] from the right.
* The function's graph curves up to meet its [`x`]-intercept at [`x=0`].
* In the numerator, the power of [`x^2`] is [`2`], implying the function touches the [`x`]-axis at [`(0,0)`], and then goes down.
* The function's graph approaches negative infinity as [`x`]-value approaches [`[$x1]`] from the left.
* In the denominator, the power of [`(x-[$x1])`] is [`1`], implying the function's graph approaches opposite infinities at both sides of [`x=[$x1]`]. The function's graph approaches positive infinity as [`x`]-value approaches [`[$x1]`] from the right.
* Finally, the function's graph approaches [`y=[$k]`] from above as [`x`]-value approaches positive infinity.

The correct graph for [`f(x)=[$f[0]]`] is Graph [`[$answer]`].
