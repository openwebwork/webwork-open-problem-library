BEGIN_PGML
In the following, if your answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, [`\cup`], which you can type as *U*. If you need  to enter the [`\infty`] symbol, type it as *inf*.

Given that [` f(x)=\sqrt{[$a]+x}`] and [` g(x)=\sqrt{[$a]-x}`],

a) The domain of [`\left(f+g\right)`] is [________________________]{$fpgd}  
a) The domain of [`\left(f-g\right)`] is [________________________]{$fmgd}  
a) The domain of [`\left(fg\right)`] is [________________________]{$ftgd}  
a) The domain of [`\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)`] is [________________________]{$fdgd}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

If we examine [`f`]'s domain, we need inputs such that [`[$a]+x\geq 0`], or in other words we need [`x\geq -[$a]`].  
If we examine [`g`]'s domain, we need inputs such that [`[$a]-x\geq 0`], or in other words we need [`x\leq [$a]`].

a) The domain of [`f+g`] is the intersection of the domain of [`f`] with the domain of [`g`]. That is, we need [`x`]-values that are both greater than or equal to [`-[$a]`] and less than or equal to [`[$a]`]. So the domain of [`f+g`] is [`[-[$a],[$a]]`].  
a) The same reasoning and domain applies to [`f-g`].
a) The same reasoning and domain applies to [`fg`].
a) To find the domain of [`\frac{f}{g}`], we first consider the intersection of the domain of [`f`] with the domain of [`g`]. That is, we need [`x`]-values that are both greater than or equal to [`-[$a]`] and less than or equal to [`[$a]`]. That leaves us with [`[-[$a],[$a]]`].  But then we must also exclude any [`x`]-values for which [`g(x)`] is [`0`]. In this case, that would be [`[$a]`]. So the domain of [`\frac{f}{g}`] is [`[-[$a],[$a])`].
