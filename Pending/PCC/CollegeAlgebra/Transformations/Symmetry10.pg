BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) If [`f`] is even, then it has symmetry with respect to the [`y`] axis. So the horizontal reflection of [`[$A]`] over the [`y`]-axis must be on its graph. So [`[@$answer[0]->TeX@]`] is on the graph of [`f`].

a) [`-f`] is a function that has the same graph as [`f`], only it has been reflected over the [`x`]-axis. So the vertical reflection of [`[$A]`] over the [`x`]-axis must be on its graph. So [`[@$answer[1]->TeX@]`] is on the graph of [`-f`].

a) If [`f`] has symmetry about the origin, then we can spin the grpah 180 degrees around the origin and obtain the same graph. Spinning by 180 degrees yields the same result as reflecting over the [`y`]-axis _and_ over the [`x`]-axis. So there must be a counterpoint to [`[$A]`] on its graph at [`[@$answer[2]->TeX@]`].
