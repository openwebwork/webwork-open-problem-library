Suppose you are given a function [`f`], and you consider shifting and reflecting the graph of [`f`].  Answer the following questions.

a) The graph of [`g`], where [`g(x) = f(x) + [$a1]`] is obtained by shifting the graph of [`f`] [@$popupa->menu@]* one unit.

a) The graph of [`g`], where [`g(x) = f(x + [$a2])`] is obtained by shifting the graph of [`f`] [@$popupb->menu@]* one unit.

a) The graph of [`g`], where [`g(x) = f(-x) `] is obtained by reflecting the graph of [`f`] over [@$popupc->menu@]*.

a) The graph of [`g`], where [`g(x) = -f(x) `] is obtained by reflecting the graph of [`f`] over [@$popupd->menu@]*.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) If [`g(x) = f(x) + [$a1]`], then [`g`] has a modification from [`f`] that is external to [`f`]'s formula, so the transformation is of a vertical nature. Vertical transformations work in an intuitive way, where addition means shifting up and subtraction means shifting down. So The graph of [`g`] is obtained by shifting the graph of [`f`] [@$popupa->correct_ans@] one unit.

a) If [`g(x) = f(x+[$a2])`], then [`g`] has a modification from [`f`] that is internal to [`f`]'s formula, so the transformation is of a horizontal nature. Horizontal transformations work in a counterintuitive way, where addition means shifting left and subtraction means shifting right. So The graph of [`g`] is obtained by shifting the graph of [`f`] [@$popupa->correct_ans@] one unit.

a) If [`g(x) = -f(x)`], then [`g`] has a modification from [`f`] that is external to [`f`]'s formula, so the transformation is of a vertical nature. The negation implies a reflection about one of the main axes, and a vertical reflection would be over the [`x`]-axis.

a) If [`g(x) = f(-x)`], then [`g`] has a modification from [`f`] that is internal to [`f`]'s formula, so the transformation is of a horizontal nature. The negation implies a reflection about one of the main axes, and a vertical reflection would be over the [`y`]-axis.
