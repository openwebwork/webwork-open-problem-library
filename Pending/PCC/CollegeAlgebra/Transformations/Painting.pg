The number of gallons of paint, \(n=f(A)\), needed to cover a house is a function of the surface area, in \(\textrm{ft}^2\).  Match each story to one expression.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. "I figured out how many gallons I needed and then bought two extra gallons just in case." This indicates we will have [`2`] more gallons than what the function [`f`] will output. So this statement corresponds to [`f(A)+2`].

a. "I bought enough paint to cover my house twice." This indicates we will have [`2`] times as much paint as what [`f`] will output. So this statement corresponds to [`2f(A)`].

a. "I bought enough paint to cover my house and my welcome sign, which measures 2 square feet." This indicates we took the area of our house, [`A`], and added two more square feet before we used the function [`f`] to determine the necessary amount of paint. So this statement corresponds to [`f(A+2)`].
