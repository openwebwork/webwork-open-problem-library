TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A cup of coffee's temperature was [`[$initial]`] degrees (Fahrenheit) when it was poured into a cup. The coffee's temperature, in Fahrenheit degrees, can be modeled by the following function:

    [`` f(t)=[$func] ``]
    
where [`t`] is the number of minutes passed since the coffee was poured into the cup.

Answer the following questions:

1) After [`[$x1]`] minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [___________]{$y1R} degrees. Round your answer to two decimal places.

2) After [___________]{$x2R} minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$y2]`] degrees. Round your answer to one decimal place.

3) In the long run, the coffee's temperature would be [___________]{$room} degrees.

$s1 = $y2-$room;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

###Question 1

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$x1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   v(t) &= [$func] \\
   v([$x1]) &= [$c]\cdot e^{[$k]\cdot([$x1])}+[$room] \\
   v([$x1]) &\approx [$y1R]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

After [`[$x1]`] minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$y1R]`] degrees.

###Question 2

We need to substitute the function's value with [`[$y2]`], and then solve for [`t`].

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   v(t) &= [$func] \\
   [$y2] &= [$func] \\
   [$s1] &= [$c]\cdot e^{[$k]t} \\
   \frac{[$s1]}{[$c]} &= e^{[$k]t} \\
   \ln\left(\frac{[$s1]}{[$c]}\right) &= [$k]t \\
   \frac{\ln\left(\frac{[$s1]}{[$c]}\right)}{[$k]} &= t \\
   [$x2R] &\approx t
\end{aligned}
    ``]

After [`[$x2R]`] minutes, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$y2]`] degrees.

###Part 3: 

To find what value the function is approaching as [`x`] becomes bigger and bigger, we can substitute the [`x`] value with infinity. Since [`e^{-\infty}=0`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   v(t) &= [$func] \\
   v(\infty) &= [$c]\cdot e^{[$k](\infty)}+[$room] \\
   &= [$c]\cdot e^{-\infty}+[$room] \\
   &= [$c]\cdot 0+[$room] \\
   &= [$room]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the long run, the coffee's temperature would be [`[$room]`] degrees (the room temperature).
