BEGIN_PGML

A person purchased [`[$total]`] grams of protein powder. Every day, he takes [`[$rate]`] grams. The amount of protein left in the bottle, in grams, can be modeled by the function [`p(d)`], where [`d`] is the number of days since the person started to consume the protein.

Using interval notation, the domain of the function [`p(d)`] is [__________________________________]{$ans}

[@KeyboardInstructions('If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the union symbol, which you can type as [|U|]*. If the answer uses [`\infty`], you may type it as [|inf|]*.')@]** 
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

There were [`[$total]`] grams of protein in the bottle, and the person consumes [`[$rate]`] grams every day. The bottle will last [`\frac{[$total]}{[$rate]}=[$days]`] days.

The function [`p(d)`] models the amount of protein, in grams, left int he bottle, where [`d`] is the number of days since the person started to consume the protein.

The value of [`d`] must be greater than or equal to [`0`] in this context.

The value of [`d`] cannot be greater than [`[$days]`]; otherwise the amount of protein left would become negative.

Therefore the domain is [`[$ans]`].
