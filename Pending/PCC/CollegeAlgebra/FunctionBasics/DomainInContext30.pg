BEGIN_PGML

An object was shot up into the air at an initial vertical speed of [`[$initSpeed]`] feet per second. Its height as time passes can be modeled by the quadratic function [`f`], where [`f(t)=[$func]`]. Here [`t`] represents the number of seconds since the object's release, and [`f(t)`] represents the object's height in feet.

Using interval notation, the domain of the function [`f(t)`] is [__________________________________]{$ans}

[@KeyboardInstructions('If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the union symbol, which you can type as [|U|]*. If the answer uses [`\infty`], you may type it as [|inf|]*.')@]**

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The parabola's [`x`]-intercepts represent the moments when the object was at a height of [`0`]: on the ground. We will solve the equation [`f(t)=0`] to find its [`x`]-intercepts. We have:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
   f(t) &= [$func] \\
   0    &= [$func] \\
   0    &= -t([$func2]) \\
   -t &= 0 & \text{or} && [$func2]&=0 \\
   t &= 0 & \text{or} && [$func3]&=[$b] \\
   t &= 0 & \text{or} && t&=[$tBack]
\end{aligned}
`]

This parabola has two [`x`]-intercepts: [`(0,0)`] and [`([$tBack],0)`]. The point [`(0,0)`] represents the moment when the object was released; the point [`([$tBack],0)`] implies the object fell back to the ground after [`[$tBackU]`].

Therefore the domain in this context is [`[$ans]`].
