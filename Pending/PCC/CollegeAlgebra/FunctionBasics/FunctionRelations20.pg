BEGIN_TEXT

Some equations involving \(x\) and \(y\) define \(y\) as a function of
\(x\), and others do not.  For example, if \(x+y=1\), we can solve for
\(y\) and obtain \(y = 1-x\). And we can then think of \(y = f(x) =
1-x\).  On the other hand, if we have the equation \(x=y^2\) then
\(y\) is not a function of \(x\), since for a given positive value
of \(x\), the value of \(y\) could equal \(\sqrt{x}\) or it could equal \(-\sqrt{x}\).
Select all of the following relations that make \(y\) a function of \(x\). There are several correct answers.

On the other hand, some equations involving \(x\) and \(y\) define \(x\) as a function of \(y\) (the other way round).

Select all of the following relations that make \(x\) a function of \(y\). There are several correct answers.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

The correct answer to the first part is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}. In each of those answers, whenever a value would be substituted in for \(x\), then either there is exactly one \(y\)-value that will make the relation true, or perhaps none at all. In the other answers, there can be an \(x\)-value where more than one \(y\)-value will make the relation true.
