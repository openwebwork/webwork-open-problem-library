BEGIN_SOLUTION

The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}. In each of those answers, whenever a value would be substituted in for \(x\), then either there is exactly one \(y\)-value that will make the relation true, or perhaps none at all.

In the other answers, there can be an \(x\)-value where more than one \(y\)-value will make the relation true.
