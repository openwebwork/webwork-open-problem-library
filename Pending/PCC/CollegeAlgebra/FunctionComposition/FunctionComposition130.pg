BEGIN_PGML

The radius [`r`] (in centimeters) of a melting snowball is given by [`r=[$base]-[$rate] t`], where [`t`] is time in hours.  The snowball is spherical, with volume given by [`V=\frac43\pi r^3`] (with [`V`] measured in cubic centimeters).  Find a formula for [`f(t)`], where [`V=f(t)\mbox{ }\mathrm{cm}^3`], the volume of the snowball as a function of time.

    [`f(t) ={}`][___________________]{$Voft}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We have been given the formula for the volume as a function of the radius:

    [`V(r) = \frac43\pi r^3`]

And we have been given some information about how the radius of the snowball is changing over time. 

    [`r(t) = [$base]-[$rate] t`]

and now we can substitute this in to our formula for [`V`]. Since we will be left with an expression in [`t`], we can write our new formula using function notation with [`V`] depending on [`t`].

    [`V(t) = [$Voft]`]
