The ratio between [`f(2)`] and [`f(1)`] is [`\frac{[@$fOfx[1]@]}{[@$fOfx[0]@]}`], which is [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`]. So if this is an exponential function, its growth factor would have to be [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`].

In moving from [`x=2`] to [`x=4`], we would have to multiply [`f(2)`] by  [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] twice:

    [`[@$fOfx[1]@]\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]}\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]} =[@$fOfx[2]@] `]

and this agrees with [`f(4)`].

In moving from [`x=4`] to [`x=5`], we would have to multiply [`f(4)`] by  [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] once:

    [`[@$fOfx[2]@]\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]} =[@$fOfx[3]@] `]

and this agrees with [`f(5)`].

In moving from [`x=5`] to [`x=8`], we would have to multiply [`f(5)`] by  [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] three times:

    [`[@$fOfx[3]@]\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]}\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]}\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]} =[@$fOfx[4]@] `]

and this agrees with [`f(8)`].

In moving from [`x=8`] to [`x=9`], we would have to multiply [`f(8)`] by  [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`] once:

    [`[@$fOfx[4]@]\cdot \frac{1}{[$b]}=[@$fOfx[5]@] `]

and this agrees with [`f(9)`].

So the table is completely consistent with [`f`] being an exponential function whose growth factor is [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`].
