BEGIN_PGML

Could the function whose values are in the table be an exponential function?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The ratio between [`f(2)`] and [`f(1)`] is [`\frac{[@$fOfx[1]@]}{[@$fOfx[0]@]}`], which is [`[$g]`]. So if this is an exponential function, its growth factor would have to be [`[$g]`].

In moving from [`x=2`] to [`x=4`], we would have to multiply [`f(2)`] by  [`[$g]`] twice:

    [`[@$fOfx[1]@]\cdot [$g]\cdot  [$g] =[@$fOfx[1]*$g*$g@] `]

and this does not agree with [`f(4)`].

So the table is not consistent with [`f`] being an exponential function. (In fact, by looking at the _differences_ between values of [`f`], we could show that this function is in fact _linear_.
