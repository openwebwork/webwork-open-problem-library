Context("Percent");


$percentDecrease = random(3,8,1);
$numberYears = random(4,7);

$b = 1-$percentDecrease/100;

$lb = ($b)**$numberYears;

$totalDecreaseRate = (1-$lb)*100;

$answer = Percent(1-$lb);

BEGIN_PGML

An investment decreases by [`[$percentDecrease]%`] each year for [`[$numberYears]`] years.  By what total percent does it decrease?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The basic exponential function template is [`A(t)=A_0(b)^t`], where [`b`] is the growth factor per unit time. We have been given the relative growth rate per year of [`-[$percentDecrease]%`], which is [`-[@$percentDecrease/100@]`] as a decimal. This means that the growth factor per year is [`1-[@$percentDecrease/100@]`], which is [`[$b]`].

So after [`t`] years, [`A(t)=A_0([$b])^t`]. After [`[$numberYears]`] years, we find that 

    [`\begin{aligned}
A([$numberYears]) &= A_0([$b])^{[$numberYears]}\\
&= A_0([$lb])
\end{aligned}`]

So the [`[$numberYears]`]-year growth factor is [`[$lb]`]. This means that the [`[$numberYears]`]-year relative growth rate is [`[$lb]-1`], which is [`[@$lb-1@]`].

So the investment will decrease by [`[$totalDecreaseRate]%`].
