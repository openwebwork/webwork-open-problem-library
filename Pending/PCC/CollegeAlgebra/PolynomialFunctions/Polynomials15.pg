BEGIN_PGML
The curve below is a graph of the polynomial function [`p`].  Use the graph to answer the questions that follow.

[@EnlargeImageStatementPGML()@]**

>>[@ image(insertGraph($graph), width=>400, height=>400) @]* <<

a.  Is the degree of [`p`] even or odd? [@$evenodd->menu@]* 

a. Is the leading coefficient of [`p`] positive or negative? [@$posneg->menu@]* 

a. List the real roots of [`p`]. [________________]

a. What is the smallest possible degree of [`p`]? [_______]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. Since both arms of [`p`] point in the same direction ([$dir]), [`p`] has an even degree.

a. Since [`p(x)\to[$lim]`] as [`x\to\infty`], the leading coefficient of [`p`] is [$ans2]. In other words, since the arm on the right points [$dir], the leading coefficient of [`p`] is [$ans2].

a. Roots are the [`x`]-values where the curve touches the [`x`]-axis. This happens at [`[$Roots]`].

a. At [`x=[$b]`] and [`x=[$d]`], the curve crosses through the [`x`] axis just like a linear function would. So the corresponding factors [`(x-[$b])`] and [`(x-[$d])`] are degree [`1`]. That is, they are not raised to a power (other than [`1`]).

    At [`x=[$c]`] and [`x=[$e]`], the curve touches the [`x`] axis and turns around. This tells us that the corresponding factors [`(x-[$c])`] and [`(x-[$e])`] are raised to an even power [`2`] or more. Each of them might be raised to [`2`], [`4`], or some such positive even power.

    All together this means that the total degree of [`p`] is at least [`1+1+2+2`], or [`6`].
