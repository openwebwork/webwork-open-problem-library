BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Each of the three zeros is a degree one zero. So we can determine the slope at each zero by preserving that zero's corresponding factor, and substituting in the zero in other factors. 

At [`x=[$r0]`],

    [`\begin{aligned}
[$p] &\longrightarrow [$c][@$p0->substitute(y=>Formula("$r0"))->TeX@]
= [@$slope[0]@]([$f0])\\
\end{aligned}`]

So the slope at [`x=[$r0]`] is [`[@$slope[0]@]`]. Basically, this has told us that for [`x`]-values close to [`[$r0]`], our function is very much like [`[@$slope[0]@]([$f0])`], which is a line with slope [`[@$slope[0]@]`] that has been shifted to cross the [`x`]-axis at [`[$r0]`].

At [`x=[$r1]`],

    [`\begin{aligned}
[$p] &\longrightarrow [$c][@$p1->substitute(y=>Formula("$r1"))->TeX@]
= [@$slope[1]@]([$f1])\\
\end{aligned}`]

So the slope at [`x=[$r1]`] is [`[@$slope[1]@]`].

At [`x=[$r2]`],

    [`\begin{aligned}
[$p] &\longrightarrow [$c][@$p2->substitute(y=>Formula("$r2"))->TeX@]
= [@$slope[2]@]([$f2])\\
\end{aligned}`]

So the slope at [`x=[$r2]`] is [`[@$slope[2]@]`].
