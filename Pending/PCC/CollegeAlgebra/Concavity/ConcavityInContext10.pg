BEGIN_PGML

When an invasive species invades a new territory, the population starts off small and increases slowly.  When there are more individuals the population starts to grow more rapidly.


a) Is this situation describing a function that is increasing or decreasing?

    [@$radioChange->buttons()@]*

a) Is this situation describing a function that is concave up or concave down?

    [@ $radioConcavity->buttons() @]*

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The population becomes larger as time passes, so the function is increasing.

Since the population is increasing at a rate that increases as time increases, the function is concave up.
