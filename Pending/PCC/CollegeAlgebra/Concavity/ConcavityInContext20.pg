BEGIN_PGML

When a pie comes out of the oven, it cools off very rapidly at first, but then cools off more slowly as it gets closer to room temperature.

a) Is this situation describing a function that is increasing or decreasing?

    [@$radioChange->buttons()@]*

a) Is this situation describing a function that is concave up or concave down?

    [@ $radioConcavity->buttons() @]*

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The temperature lowers as time passes, so the function is decreasing.

Since the temperature is decreasing at a decreasing rate, the function is concave up. Another way to put this is that the function is increasing with a _negative_ rate that becomes less negative over time. So the rate of increase is technically increasing once you think about how these terms apply to negative numbers.
