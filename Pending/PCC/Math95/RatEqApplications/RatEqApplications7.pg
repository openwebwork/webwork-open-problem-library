It takes one painter \($longer\) longer to paint a house than it does a more experienced painter.  Together they can paint the house in \($togetherTime\).  How long does it take for each painter to paint the house working alone?
$PAR

The more experienced painter takes \{ans_rule(15)\} to paint the house alone, and the less experienced painter takes \{ans_rule(15)\}.
