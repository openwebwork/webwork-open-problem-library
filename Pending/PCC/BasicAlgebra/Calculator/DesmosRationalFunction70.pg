BEGIN_PGML

In a certain store, cashiers can serve [`[$a]`] customers per hour on average. If [`x`] customers arrive at the store in a given hour, then the average number of customers [`C`] waiting in line can be modeled by the function

    [`` C(x) = [$func] ``]

where [`x<[$a]`].

Answer the following questions with a graphing calculator. Round your answers to integers.

a) If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [__________]{$y1r} customers waiting in line.

a) If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [__________]{$ans2} customers arrived in the past hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `]. Note that we should change [`C(x)`] to [`f(x)`] when we use desmos.com.

a) If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, we need to substitute [`x=[$x1]`] into [`f(x)`].

    Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$x1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$y1]`].
    
    If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [`[$y1r]`] customers waiting in line.

a) If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, to find how many customers arrived in the past hour, we need to substitute [`[$y2r]`] into the function's [`y`]-value and find the corresponding [`x`]-value.

    Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$y2r]`].

    Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2r]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

    Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2r]`]. Desmos shows [`([$r2],[$y2r])`] and [`([$r1],[$y2r])`]. We should ignore the solution with a negative [`x`]-value.
    
    If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [`[$ans2]`] customers arrived in the past hour.
