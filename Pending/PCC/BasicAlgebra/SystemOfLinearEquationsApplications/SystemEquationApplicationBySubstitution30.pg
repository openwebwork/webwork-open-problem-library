BEGIN_PGML

[$name] invested a total of [`[$cInit]`] in two accounts. One account pays [`[$p1]%`] interest annually; the other pays [`[$p2]%`] interest annually. At the end of the year, [$name] earned a total of [`[$cTotalInt]`] in interest. How much money did [$name] invest in each account?

Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following questions.

    [$name] invested [__________]{$cFund1} in the [`[$p1]%`] account.

    [$name] invested [__________]{$cFund2} in the [`[$p2]%`] account.

$s1 = $rTotalInt - $dp2*$rInit;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [$name] invested [`x`] dollars in the [`[$p1]%`] account, and [`y`] dollars in the [`[$p2]%`] account.

It's given that the total amount of investment was [`[$cInit]`], so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$rInit] ``]

Since the first account generated [`[$p1]%`] of interest for [`x`] dollars, the amount of interest was [`[$dp1]x`] dollars.

Similarly, since the second account generated [`[$p2]%`] of interest for [`y`] dollars, the amount of interest was [`[$dp2]y`] dollars.

It's given that the total amount of interest was [`[$cTotalInt]`], so we have:

    [`` [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y=[$rTotalInt] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$rInit] \\
  [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= [$rTotalInt]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We will use substitution to solve this problem. First, we solve for [`y`] in the first equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   x+y &= [$rInit] \\
   x+y \mathbf{{}-x} &= [$rInit]\mathbf{{}-x} \\
   y &= -x+[$rInit]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Next, we substitute [`y`] with [`-x+[$rInit]`] in [`[$dp1]x +[$dp2]y = [$rTotalInt]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$dp1]x +[$dp2]y &= [$rTotalInt] \\
   [$dp1]x +[$dp2](-x+[$rInit]) &= [$rTotalInt] \\
   [$dp1]x -[$dp2]x+[$dp2*$rInit] &= [$rTotalInt] \\
   [$dp1-$dp2]x +[$dp2*$rInit] &= [$rTotalInt] \\
   [$dp1-$dp2]x +[$dp2*$rInit] \mathbf{{}-[$dp2*$rInit]} &= [$rTotalInt] \mathbf{{}-[$dp2*$rInit]} \\
   [$dp1-$dp2]x &= [$s1] \\
   x &= [$rFund1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Finally, we substitute [`x=[$rFund1]`] into [`y = -x+[$rInit]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   y &= -x+[$rInit] \\
   y &= -[$rFund1]+[$rInit] \\
   y &= [$rFund2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The solution to the system of equations is [`x=[$rFund1],y=$rFund2]`]. This implies [$name] invested [`[$cFund1]`] in the [`[$p1]%`] account and [`[$cFund2]`] in the [`[$p2]%`] account.
