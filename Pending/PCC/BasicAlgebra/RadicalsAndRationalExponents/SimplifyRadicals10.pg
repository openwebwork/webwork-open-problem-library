# for the problem.

  "PGstandard.pl",       #Always needed
  "MathObjects.pl",      #Almost always needed
  "PGML.pl",             #Almost always needed

########Begin Problem Setup############
#This is where you initialize variables and run computations

########Begin What the Student Sees############

TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for
# the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the
# source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Simplify the expression. Use *sqrt()* for the square root symbol. For example: [`\sqrt{2} =`]  *sqrt(2)*.

    [``[$sqrt1] + [$sqrt2] =``] [_____________]{$answer}

########Begin more complicated answer processing (if needed)############

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this
#feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and
#may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a
#walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since these are like radicals, we can combine them as like terms.

   [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
        [$sqrt1] + [$sqrt2] &= ([$a] + [$b]) \sqrt{x} \\
                            &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
``]
