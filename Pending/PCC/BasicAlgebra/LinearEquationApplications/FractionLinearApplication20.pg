BEGIN_PGML

[$name] is jogging in a straight line. [@ucfirst($pronoun)@] started at a place [`[$b]`] meters from the starting line, and ran toward the starting line at the speed of [`[$num]`] meters every [`[$den]`] seconds. After how many seconds will [$name] be [`[$y1]`] meters away from the starting line?

[$name] will be [`[$y1]`] meters away from the starting line [______]{$x1} seconds since she started running.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[$name] runs [`[$num]`] meters every [`[$den]`] seconds, implying her speed is [`\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}`] meters per second.

In [`x`] seconds, [$pronoun] can run [`\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}x`] meters.

Since [$pronoun] was [`[$b]`] meters away from the starting line, and ran toward it, her distance from the starting line was decreasing, and can be modeled by:

    [`` [$b]-\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}x ``]

To find when she will be [`[$y1]`] meters away from the starting line, we can write and solve this equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$b] - \frac{[$num]}{[$den]}x &= [$y1] \\
   [$den]\cdot[$b]  - [$den]\cdot \frac{[$num]}{[$den]}x &= [$den]\cdot[$y1] \\
   [$den*$b] - [$num]x &= [$den*$y1] \\
   [$den*$b] - [$num]x \mathbf{{}-[$den*$b]} &= [$den*$y1] \mathbf{{}-[$den*$b]} \\
   -[$num]x &= [$den*$y1-$den*$b] \\
   \frac{-[$num]x}{-[$num]} &= \frac{[$den*$y1-$den*$b]}{-[$num]} \\
   x &= [$x1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

[$name] will be [`[$y1]`] meters away from the starting line [`[$x1]`] seconds since she started running.
