TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

Scientists are conducting an experiment with a gas in a sealed container. The mass of the gas is measured, and the scientists realize that the gas is leaking over time in a linear way. 

[@numberWord($x1,capital=>1)@] minutes since the experiment started, the gas had a mass of [`[$y1]`] grams.

[@numberWord($x2,capital=>1)@] minutes since the experiment started, the gas had a mass of [`[$y2]`] grams.

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes that have passed since the experiment started, and let [`y`] be the mass of the gas in grams at that moment. Use a linear equation to model the weight of the gas over time.
a) A point-slope equation to model this is [______________]{$ansPS_evaluator}.

b)  [`[$x3]`] minutes after the experiment started, there would be [___________]{$y3} grams of gas left.

c)  If a linear model continues to be accurate, [___________]{$x4} minutes since the experiment started, all gas in the container will be gone.

$s1=$y2-$y1;
$s2=$x2-$x1;
$s3=$m*$x1;
$s4=-$s3;
$s5=$m*$x3;
$s6=$y4-$b;

$outputx1 = $x1<0 ? "($x1)" : $x1;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in point-slope form looks like [` y=m(x-x_0)+y_0 `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`(x_0,y_0)`] is some point we know to be on the line. We first need to find the line's slope. To find the slope, we need two points on the line. We have been given that [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`] are points on the linear model, so we can use the slope formula:

    [`` \text{slope}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} ``]

    First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:

    [`` ([$x1],[$y1]) \longrightarrow (x_{1},y_{1}) ``]

    [`` ([$x2],[$y2]) \longrightarrow (x_{2},y_{2}) ``]

    Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$outputy1]}{[$x2]-[$outputx1]}\\&=\frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]}\\&=[$m] \end{aligned}``]

    This line's slope is [`[$m]`]. This implies that the gas is leaking with a rate of [`[$negm]`] grams per minute.

    So now we have that [` y=[$m](x-x_0)+y_0 `]. We can either use [`(x_0,y_0)=([$x1],[$y1])`] or [`(x_0,y_0)=([$x2],[$y2])`] to get [`[$ansPS]`].

b)    After [`[$x3]`] minutes, we can find the mass of the remaining gas if we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m](x-[$x1])+[$y1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]([$x3]-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    So after [`[$x3]`] minutes, there are [`[$y3]`] grams of gas remaining.

c)    To find when the gas will be all gone, we need to find when there are  [`[$y4]`] grams of gas left.  We can substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m](x-[$x1])+[$y1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m](x-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  [@$y4-$y1@] &= [$m](x-[$x1])\\
  \frac{[@$y4-$y1@]}{[$m]} &= x - [$x1]\\
  [@($y4-$y1)/$m@] &= x - [$x1]\\
  [@($y4-$y1)/$m+$x1@] &= x\\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    So after [`[$x4]`] minutes, the gas will be all gone.
