BEGIN_PGML

Starting a few days ago. [$name] has been adding [`[$slopeC]`] to [$possessive] piggy bank every day. On Oct. 1, [$pronoun] had [`[$yInterceptC]`] in his piggy bank.

Assume [`x`] days after Oct. 1, [$name] has [`y`] dollars in his piggy bank. Use a linear equation to model the amount of money in the piggy bank.

Find this line's [`x`]-intercept, and interpret its meaning in this context.

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

END_PGML

ANS( $radio->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [`x`] days after Oct. 1, [$name] has [`y`] dollars in his piggy bank. We can use this linear equation to model the amount of money in the piggy bank:

    [`` y = [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] ``]

A line's [`x`]-intercept looks like [`(x,0)`]. To find its [`x`] intercept, we substitute [`y`] in the equation with [`0`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   y &= [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] \\
   0 &= [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] \\
   -[$yIntercept] &= [$slope]x \\
   \frac{-[$yIntercept]}{[$slope]} &= \frac{[$slope]x}{[$slope]} \\
   [$xIntercept] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The line's [`x`]-intercept is [`([$xIntercept],0)`].

The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
