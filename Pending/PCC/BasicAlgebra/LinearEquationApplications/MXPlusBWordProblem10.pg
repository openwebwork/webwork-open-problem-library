BEGIN_PGML

A gym charges members [`[$ca]`] for a registration fee, and then [`[$cb]`] per month. You became a member some time ago, and now you have paid a total of [`[$ct]`] to the gym. How many months have passed since you joined the gym?

    [____]{$ans} months have passed since you joined the gym.

$s2=$t-$a;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let [`x`] be the number of months since you became a member of the gym.

If you pay [`[$cb]`] per month, you would pay [`[$b] \cdot x`] dollars for [`x`] months. In addition, you paid [`[$ca]`] up front.

Now we can write an equation:

    [`` [$a]+[$b]x = [$t] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$a] +[$b]x &= [$t] \\
  [$a] +[$b]x\mathbf{{} -[$a]} &= [$t]\mathbf{{} -[$a]} \\
  [$b]x      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{[$b]x}{[$b]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{[$b]} \\
  x   &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
`]

[`[$ans]`] months have passed since you joined the gym.
