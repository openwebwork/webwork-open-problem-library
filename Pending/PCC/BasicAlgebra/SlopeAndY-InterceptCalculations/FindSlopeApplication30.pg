BEGIN_PGML

A biologist has been observing a tree's height. [@ ucfirst( numberWord($x1) )@] months into the observation, the tree was [`[$y1]`] feet tall. [@ ucfirst( numberWord($x2) )@] months into the observation, the tree was [`[$y2]`] feet tall. What is the rate at which the tree is growing? In other words, what is the slope if you plotted height versus time?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To find the slope, we need two points on the line. We have been given that [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`] are points on the linear model, so we can use the slope formula:

    [`` \text{slope}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} ``]

    First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:

    [`` ([$x1],[$y1]) \longrightarrow (x_{1},y_{1}) ``]

    [`` ([$x2],[$y2]) \longrightarrow (x_{2},y_{2}) ``]

    Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$outputy1]}{[$x2]-[$outputx1]}\\&=\frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]}\\&=[$m] \end{aligned}``]

    This line's slope is [`[$m]`]. This implies that the tree is growing at a rate of [`[$rate]`].
