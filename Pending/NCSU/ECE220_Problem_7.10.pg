$PAR
Instructions for forms of answers in differential equation problems:
$BR For second order DEs, the roots of the characteristic equation may be real or complex. If the roots are real, the complementary solution is the weighted sum of real exponentials. Use C1 and C2 for the weights, where C1 is associated with the root with smaller magnitude. If the roots are complex, the complementary solution is the weighted sum of complex conjugate exponentials, which can be written as a constant times a decaying exponential times a cosine with phase. Use C1 for the constant and Phi for the phase. (Note: Some equations in the text give the constant multiplying the decaying exponential as 2C1. This was done for the derivation. The constant for this problem should be C1 alone.)

$PAR
Let's review the procedure for solving all differential equations: Find the form of the complementary solution, solve for the particular solution, find the coefficients of the complementary solution as part of the total solution from a system of equations determined by the initial conditions. 

To find the form of the complementary solution, we find the roots of the characteristic equation \( \lambda^2 + $b\lambda + $c = 0\).For this example, the roots are complex and are given by \( -$a \pm j$wc \). This means the complementary solution has the form \( v_c(t) = C_1 e^{(-$a + j$wc)t} + C_2 e^{(-$a - j$wc) t} \). We know that since the solution is real and the roots are complex conjugates that \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are complex conjugates. This means that we can write the complementary solution in the form \(  v_c(t) = C_1 e^{-$a t} cos($wc t + \phi) \). 
$PAR
To find the particular solution, we know the form of the particular solution is the same as that of the driving function. In this case, it is a constant, \( v_p(t) =  B \). We differentiate the particular solution as needed and substitute into the differential equation. Since \( \dot{v}_p(t) = \ddot{v}_p(t) = 0\), we have the equation, \( $c v_p(t) = $c  B = $A.\) We solve for \( B \) to obtain \(  B = $A/$c = $B.\)
$PAR
Now, we determine the coefficients of the complementary solution. The total solution has the form, \( v_t(t) = C_1 e^{-$a t} cos($wc t + \phi) +  $B \), where we are leaving off the step function, \( u(t) = step(t) \) for now. We differentiate the total solution as needed and substitute into the equations for the initial conditions. This gives
\( C_1 e^{-$a t} cos($wc t + \phi) +  $B |_{t=0} = $y0 \) and for the derivative
$BR
\(  -$a C_1 e^{-$a t} cos($wc t + \phi) - $wc C_1 e^{-$a t} sin($wc t + \phi)   |_{t=0} = $ydot0 \). 
$BR
Evaluating the functions at \( t = 0\), we have 
$BR
\( C_1 cos( \phi) = $y0 -$B = $b1\), and
$BR
\(  -$a C_1 cos(\phi) - $wc C_1  sin( \phi)  = $ydot0 \).
$BR
This is a nonlinear system of equations for \( C_1 \) and \( \phi \). We can write \( C_1 \) in terms of \( cos( \phi) \) as 
$BR
\( C_1  =  $b1/cos( \phi) \), then substitute \( C_1 \) into the derivative equation, and obtain
$BR
\(  -$a  \cdot ($b1) - $wc  \cdot ($b1)  tan( \phi)  = $ydot0 \).
$BR
This gives the formula for \( tan( \phi) \) as 
$BR
\(  tan( \phi)  = [$ydot0 + $a \cdot ($b1)]/[-$wc($b1)]  = $b3 .\)
$BR
We need cosine and sine of \( \phi \), which we can obtain by use trig definitions: the side of the right triangle opposite \( \phi \) is \(  $b3\) and the side adjacent is 1. The hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{($b3)^2 + 1} = $b4\), which gives the cosine  as
$BR
\( cos(\phi) = \frac{1}{$b4} \) which gives 
$BR
\( C_1  =  ($b1) \cdot $b4  = $mag \)
$BR
Substituting into the total solution and including the step function, we have 
$BR
\( ($mag * e^{-$a t} * cos($wc t + $ph) + $B) u(t) \).
