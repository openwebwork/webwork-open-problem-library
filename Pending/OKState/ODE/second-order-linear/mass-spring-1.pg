BEGIN_PGML
A [$mass] kg railcar hits a bumper (a spring) at [$speed] m/s,
and the spring compresses by [$compress] m.  Assume no damping.

Find [:k=:] [____________]{"$k"}{25} N/m
[@ $SPACE @]* [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]* 

_*Hint:* Solve the differential equation leaving [:k:] as unknown.
The compression of the spring is the maximum displacement.
It is easiest if you assume that 0 displacement is where
the railcar is just touching the bumper._

How far does the spring compress when a
[$mass2] kg railcar hits the spring at the same speed?

[____________]{"$compress2"}{25} m
[@ $SPACE @]* [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]* 

If the spring
would break if it compresses further than [$compresscrit] m, what is the maximum
mass of a railcar that can hit it at [$speed] m/s?

[____________]{"$masscrit"}{25} kg
[@ $SPACE @]* [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]* 

What is
the maximum mass of a railcar that can hit the spring without breaking
at [$dspeed] m/s?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The equation to solve is

>>[``
[$mass] x'' + k x = 0, \qquad x(0) = 0, \quad x'(0) = [$speed].
``]<<

The solution is (without yet solving for [:x'(0)=[$speed]:])

>>[``
x(t) = C \sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{[$mass]}}t\right).
``]<<

Now [:C:] is the maximum displacement, that is, how far the spring
compresses.  As

>>[``
x'(t) = \sqrt{\frac{k}{[$mass]}} C \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{[$mass]}} t\right) ,
``]<<

we have to satisfy

>>[``
[$speed] = x'(0) = \sqrt{\frac{k}{[$mass]}} C = \sqrt{\frac{k}{[$mass]}} [$compress].
``]<<

Solving for [:k:] we find [:k=[$k]:] N/m.

The other parts are similar.  The idea is to now solve

>>[``
m x'' + [$k] x = 0, \qquad x(0) = 0, \quad x'(0) = s,
``]<<

where [:m:] is mass and [:s:] is speed.  If [:C:] is the
compression as before, we find the equation

>>[``
s = \sqrt{\frac{[$k]}{m}} C .
``]<<

So if a [$mass2] kg railcar hits the spring it compresses
[$compress2] m.

The mass of rail car that compresses the spring to
[$compresscrit] m at speed [$speed] m/s is [$masscrit] kg, so that is the maximum
mass for that speed.

For speed [$dspeed] m/s, the maximum mass is [$masscritdouble] kg.
