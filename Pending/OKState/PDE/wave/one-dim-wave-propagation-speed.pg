BEGIN_PGML
Water level in a long thin channel also follows the wave equation with waves propagating along the channel.
Suppose the equation for a particular channel is

>>[`` u_{tt} = [$asq] u_{xx} ``]<<

where as usual [`x`] is the position along the channel and [`t`] is time (let us not worry about the units).
Suppose the channel is very very long so that we don't have to worry about its ends.

At time [`t=0`] the water is completely quiet with no waves at all, when suddenly a large boulder 
falls into the channel and makes a wave at the position [`x=0.`]

At what time will Bob standing at position [`x=[$b]`] see the wave?

[`t={}`] [________]{"$b/$a"}

# Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The solution looks like [`u(x,t) = A(x-[$a]t)+B(x+[$a]t)`].
The boulder creates a splash around [`x=0`] so in our solution
the functions [`A(x)`] and [`B(x)`] are
only nonzero around [`x=0`].  So for Bob to see the wave
at [`x=[$b]`] it must be that [`[$b]-[$a]t = 0`] (Bob only sees the [`A`] wave, the wave [`B`]
is moving in the opposite direction and Bob will never see it).
That is, Bob sees the wave at [`t = \frac{[$b]}{[$a]}.`]
