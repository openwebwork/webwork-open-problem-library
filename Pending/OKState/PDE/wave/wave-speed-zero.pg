BEGIN_PGML
In the wave equation

>>[`` u_{tt} = a^2 u_{xx}  , \qquad 0 < x < 1 , \quad t > 0, ``]<<

suppose we let [`a`] go to zero.

As [`a`] becomes smaller the frequency of oscillation 
[__________]{$freqpop} and the length (in time) of one cycle
[__________]{$cyclepop}

When [`a=0,`] then the frequency is
[__________]{"0"}
([@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*)
and the length of the cycle is
[__________]{$zerocyclepop}

When [`a`] reaches zero, we have the equation

>>[`` u_{tt} = 0  , \qquad 0 < x < 1 , \quad t > 0. ``]<<

Consider the initial conditions
[`u(x,0) = [$b] \sin(\pi x)`] and
[`u_t(x,0) = [$c] \sin(\pi x) .`]

The solution is [_______]{"$b \sin(\pi x) + $c t \sin(\pi x)"}{50}
