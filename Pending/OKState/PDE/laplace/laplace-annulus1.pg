We wish to solve
\[
\nabla^2 u = u_{rr} + \frac{1}{r} u_r + \frac{1}{r^2} u_{\theta\theta} = 0
\]
in polar coordinates for the region \(1 \leq r \leq $a.\)
(It is the region between the circles of radius 1 and \($a.\))
As the boundary conditions
Suppose that \(u = $b\) if \(r=1 ,\) and
\(u = $c \) if \(r=$a\).
$PAR
To solve this problem assume that \(u\) does not depend on \(\theta ,\)
that is, \(u\) is a function of \(r\) alone.  Write down the Laplacian
in this case and solve.

# Solution

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
If \(u\) is a function only of \(r ,\) then the Laplace equation
is \(u_{rr} + \frac{1}{r} u_r = 0 . \)
It is really just an ODE.
The general solution for this equation is \( u = A + B \ln r . \)
Solving for the initial conditions we find that
\( u = $answer1 . \)
