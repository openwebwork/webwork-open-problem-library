# Solution

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
Each derivative multiplies the coefficient by \(\pm n\).  After \(($a-2)\) derivatives, the coefficient will be
\[
\frac{\pm $b n^{$a-2}}{$c n^3+$d n^{$a}},
\]
which goes to zero as \(\frac{1}{n^2}\),
so the series still converges to a continuous function.  But after another derivative the coefficient will be
\[
\frac{\pm $b n^{$a-1}}{$c n^3+$d n^{$a}}
\]
which goes to zero as \(\frac{1}{n}\) and we could expect a discontinuous function.  That means the \(f^{($a-2)}\)
would have ``corners,'' that is, points where the derivative does not exit.
