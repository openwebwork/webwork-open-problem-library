How to Install the WeBWorK Problem Library Version 2.5
--- -- ------- --- ------- ------- ------- ------- ---

Installing the problem library can be done in 5 steps.


1. Download and unpack files
----------------------------

The files can be obtained from 
   cd /opt/webwork/libraries
   http://github.com/openwebwork/webwork-open-problem-library

You can download the library as a zipfile, or using git software.

Once you have downloaded the library, you will have a directory webwork-open-problem-library
containing the following files and directories:

  INSTALL
  OPL_LICENSE
  OpenProblemLibrary/
  README.md

In the following instructions, the directory OpenProblemLibrary
is refered to as the "problem library"


2. Tell WeBWorK where on your disk you put the problem library
--------------------------------------------------------------

In the file $WEBWORK_ROOT/conf/localOverrides.conf, set the following
values.  The first one is where you put the problem library files
in step 1.

$problemLibrary{root}    = "/opt/webwork/libraries/webwork-open-problem-library/OpenProblemLibrary";
$problemLibrary{version} = "2.5";


3. Run the installation script
------------------------------

Run the command OPL-update which is in the directory $WEBWORK_ROOT/bin.
If $WEBWORK_ROOT/bin is not in your path, you may need to specify
the full path, which might look something like

  /opt/webwork/webwork2/bin/OPL-update

The script will print diagnostic information as it goes.  When it
finishes, you are ready to go.


4. Adjust existing courses.
---------------------------

If you have courses which had been accessing version 1 of the problem
library, your courses will have a symbolic link in their templates
directories called Library.  Delete this link (rm Library).  WeBWorK
will make the correct new link for you the next time you use the library browser.


5. Using the Rochester problem library from OPL
-----------------------------------------------

For many years, the canonical set of problems people would start with
for their WeBWorK installation was the Rochester collection.  All of
those problems are now part of the OPL.  Since development/refinement
of OPL problems will continue, it is a good idea to use the OPL
problems instead.

If you have existing problem sets, or you simply want to be able to
browse the Rochester problems as you always have, you can still use
the OPL problems for this purpose.

The trickiest part of the instructions for doing this is that
different systems may have put files in different places.  Here we
assume:

  OPL is located at /opt/libary/webwork-open-problem-library/ProblemLibrary

  Rochester problems were a symbolic link in each course templates
  directory called "rochester_problib" (you may have to substitute
  your own value in the commands below).

Then, move to the templates directory of a course:

  cd /opt/courses/MyCourseName/templates

Then execute the commands:

  rm rochester_problib
  ln -s Library/Rochester rochester_problib

Then repeat this for each existing course.  In the future, if new
courses are made by copying the templates directories from existing
courses, the changes will be carried over automatically.

Test and enjoy.

Upgrading
---------

First update the problems in the problem library.  "cd" to the
location of the problem library, which might be

  cd /opt/library/webwork-open-problem-library/OpenProblemLibrary

depending on where you installed it initially.  From that location,
give the command

  git pull

This will update any problems you have already, and download new
problems if the problem library has grown. To register those new problems with the webwork library browser run

  webwork2/bin/OPL-update
