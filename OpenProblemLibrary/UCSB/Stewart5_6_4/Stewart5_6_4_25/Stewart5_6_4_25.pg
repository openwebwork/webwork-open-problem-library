$PAR
The tank shown below is full of water.  Recall that the density of water is \(1000\;kg/m^3.\)  Suppose that the pump breaks down after \(4.7 \times 10^5 J\) of work have been done.  What is the depth (in meters) of the water remaining in the tank?  Make sure your answer is accurate to the nearest tenth.
