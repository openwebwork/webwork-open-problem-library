$PAR
A leaky 10-kg bucket is lifted from the ground to a height of 12 m at a constant speed with a rope that weighs 0.8 kg/m.  Initially, the bucket contains 36 kg of water, but the water leaks at a constant rate and finishes draining just as the bucket reaches the 12 m level.  How much work is done (in J)?

$PAR
Work done = \{ans_rule(30)\} J
