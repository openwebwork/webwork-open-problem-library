BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
Alabama Instruments Company has set up a production line to manufacture a new calculator.  The rate of production of these calculators after \(t\) weeks is 
\[\frac{dx}{dt}=5000\left(1-\frac{100}{(t+10)^2}\right) \textrm{ calculators/week}.\]
(Notice that the production approaches 5000 per week as time goes on, but the initial production is lower because of the workers' unfamiliarity with the new techniques.)  

$PAR
Find the number of calculators produced from the beginning of the third week to the end of the fourth week.

$PAR
Number of calculators = \{ans_rule(30)\}
