$PAR
A vertical plate is submerged in water and has the shape as seen in the picture.  Using the facts that the density of water is \(1000\; kg/m^3\) and acceleration due to gravity is \(9.8\; m/s^2,\) calculate the hydrostatic force (in N) against the end of the tank.  Make sure that your answer is correct to the nearest hundred.  

$PAR
(Hint: First set up a Riemann sum that approximates the hydrostatic force, which can then be used to obtain an integral that represents the force.)
