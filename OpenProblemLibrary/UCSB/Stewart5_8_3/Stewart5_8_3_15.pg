$PAR
A swimming pool is 20 ft wide and 40 ft long and its bottom is an inclined plane, the shallow end having a depth of 3 ft and the deep end, 9 ft.  Suppose the pool is full of water, and assume that the weight density of water is \(62.5\,lb/ft^3.\)

$PAR$HR$PAR
(a) Find the hydrostatic force (in lb) on the shallow end.

$PAR
Hydrostatic force = \{ans_rule(30)\} lb

$PAR$HR$PAR
(b) Find the hydrostatic force (in lb) on the deep end.

$PAR
Hydrostatic force = \{ans_rule(30)\} lb

$PAR$HR$PAR
(c) Find the hydrostatic force (in lb) on one of the sides that extends from the shallow end to the deep end.

$PAR
Hydrostatic force = \{ans_rule(30)\} lb

$PAR$HR$PAR
(d) Find the hydrostatic force (in lb) on the bottom of the pool.

$PAR
Hydrostatic force = \{ans_rule(30)\} lb
