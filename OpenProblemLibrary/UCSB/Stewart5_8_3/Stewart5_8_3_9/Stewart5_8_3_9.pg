$PAR
A vertical plate is submerged in water and has the shape as seen in the picture.  Assume that the measurements shown in the picture have SI units.  Using the facts that the density of water is \(1000\; kg/m^3\) and acceleration due to gravity is \(9.8\; m/s^2,\) calculate the hydrostatic force (in N) against the end of the tank.  

$PAR
(Hint: First set up a Riemann sum that approximates the hydrostatic force, which can then be used to obtain an integral that represents the force.)
