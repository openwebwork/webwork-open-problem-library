$PAR
A vertical plate is submerged in water and has the shape as seen in the picture.  Using the fact that the weight of water is \(62.5\; lbs/ft^3,\) calculate the hydrostatic force (in lbs) against the end of the tank.  Give your answer correct to the nearest hundred.

$PAR
(Hint: First set up a Riemann sum that approximates the hydrostatic force, which can then be used to obtain an integral that represents the force.)

$PAR 
\{ image( $pictID1, height => 228, width => 292, tex_size=>300 )  \}

$PAR
Hydrostatic force = \{ans_rule(30)\} lbs
