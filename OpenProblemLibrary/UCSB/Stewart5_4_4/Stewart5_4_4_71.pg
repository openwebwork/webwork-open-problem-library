BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

The first appearance in print of l'Hospital's rule was in the book ${BITALIC}Analyse des Infiniment Petits${EITALIC} published by the Marquis de l'Hospital in 1696. This was the first calculus ${BITALIC}textbook${EITALIC} ever published and the example that the Marquis used in that book to illustrate his rule was to find the limit of the function

$PAR

\(y=\dfrac{\sqrt{2 a^3 x - x^4}-a\sqrt[3]{a a x}}{a-\sqrt[4]{a x^3}}\)

$PAR

as \(x\) approaches \(a\), where \(a > 0\). (At that time it was common to write \(aa\) instead of \(a^2\).) Solve this problem, your answer may depend upon \(a\).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\}

END_TEXT

ANS(fun_cmp('16*a/9', vars => ['a']));
