Boyle's Law states that when a sample of gas is compressed at a constant temperature, the pressure \(P\) and the volume \(V\) satisfy the equation \(PV=C\), where \(C\) is a constant. Suppose that at a certain instant the volume is \(600\,cm^3\), the pressure is \(150\,kPa\), and the pressure is increasing at a rate of \(20\,kPa/min\). At what rate is the volume decreasing at this instant?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\} \(cm^3/min\)
