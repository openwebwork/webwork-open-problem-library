Brain weight \(B\) as a function of body weight \(W\) in fish has been modeled by the power function \(B=.007W^{2/3}\), where \(B\) and \(W\) are measured in grams. A model for body weight as a function of body length \(L\) (measured in \(cm\)) is \(W=.12L^{2.53}\). If, over \(10\) million years, the average length of a certain species of fish evolved from \(15\,cm\) to \(20\,cm\) at a constant rate, how fast was the species' brain growing when the average length was \(18\,cm\)? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.
