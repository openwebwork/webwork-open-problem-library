The $BBOLD curvature $EBOLD \(\kappa\) at a point \(P\) of a curve is defined as
\[\kappa=\left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right|,\]
where \(\phi\) is the angle of inclination of the tangent line at \(P\), as shown in the figure below.  Thus, the curvature is the absolute value of the rate of change of \(\phi\) with respect to arc length.  It can be regarded as a measure of the rate of change of direction of the curve at \(P\).

$PAR
For a parametric curve \(x=x(t),\) \(y=y(t),\) one can derive the following formula for curvature:
\[\kappa = \frac{|\dot{x}\ddot{y}-\ddot{x}\dot{y}|}{[\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2]^{3/2}}\]
where the dots indicate derivatives with respect to \(t\), so \(\dot{x}=dx/dt.\)

$PAR
One can derive a second formula for curvature by regarding the curve \(y=f(x)\) as the parametric curve \(x=x,\quad y=f(x),\) with parameter \(x\).  Then one can prove the curvature formula
\[\kappa=\frac{|d^2y/dx^2|}{[1+(dy/dx)^2]^{3/2}}\]

$PAR
You should make sure that you can prove that these formulas are true!

Use the first formula above to find the curvature of the cycloid
\[x=\theta-\sin(\theta),\quad y=1-\cos(\theta),\]
at the top of one of its arches.
