$PAR

An object with weight \(W\) is dragged along a horizontal plane by a force acting along a rope attached to the object. If the rope makes an angle \(t\) with the plane, then the magnitude of the force is \(\displaystyle F=\frac{\mu W}{\mu \sin{t}+\cos{t}}\), where \(\mu\) is a constant called the coefficient of friction. Let \(W=50\) lb and \(\mu=.6\). $PAR

(a) Find the rate of change of F with respect to \(t\). $BR
(b) When is this rate of change equal to zero? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

$PAR

\(F'(t) =\) \{ans_rule(40)\} $BR
\(t=\) \{ans_rule(20)\} rad.
