$PAR

An elastic band is hung on a hook and a mass is hung on the lower end of the band. When the mass is pulled downward and then released, it vibrates vertically. $BR
The equation of motion is \(s(t)=2\cos{t}+3\sin{t}, \; t\geq 0\), where \(s\) is measured in centimeters and \(t\) in seconds. (We take the positive direction to be downward.) $BR
(a) Find the velocity function. $BR
(b) When does the mass pass through the equilibrium position for the first time? $BR
(c) How far from its equilibrium position does the mass travel? $PAR

**For parts (b) and (c), round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

$PAR

\(v(t) =\) \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
\(t=\) \{ans_rule(20)\} sec $BR
\(d=\) \{ans_rule(20)\} cm
