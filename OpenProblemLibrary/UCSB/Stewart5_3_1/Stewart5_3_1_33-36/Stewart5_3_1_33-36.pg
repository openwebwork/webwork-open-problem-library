$PAR
Jack and Jill went out for pizza. While gagging on a pepper, Jack began
to channel Sir Isaac Newton.  He furiously drew eight graphs onto eight
napkins, and then named each graph.  Copies of these amazing eight napkins, together with the names Jack gave them, can be found below.
$PAR
Jill was skeptical, until she noticed that one of the graphs showed a function whose derivative was graphed on a different napkin.  In fact:
$PAR
Here are four functions whose derivatives are graphed on other napkins:  $BR
\{ $ml -> print_q() \}
$PAR
Here are the names of the four derivative functions:  
\{$ml -> print_a() \}  $BR
Match the two.  That is, place the letter A, B, C, or D from the second set of napkins next to the number 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the function whose derivative it depicts.
