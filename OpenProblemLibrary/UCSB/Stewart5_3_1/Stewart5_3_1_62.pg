BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
A tangent line is drawn to the hyperbola \( xy= 1 \) at a point \(\displaystyle P=\left($a,\ \frac{1}{$a}\right) \). Find the midpoint \(M\) of the line segment cut from this tangent line by the coordinate axis. $PAR

${BBOLD}Note:${EBOLD} It turns out that the triangle formed by the tangent line and the coordinate axes always has the same area, no matter where \(P\) is located on the hyperbola.

$PAR

\(x(M)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $SPACE $SPACE
\(y(M)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}
