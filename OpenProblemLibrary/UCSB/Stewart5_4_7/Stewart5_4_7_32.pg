BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

A piece of wire $a m long is cut into two pieces. One piece is bent into a square and the other is bent into a circle.

$PAR

(a) How much of the wire should go to the square to maximize the total area enclosed by both figures?

\{ans_rule(20)\} m

$PAR

(b) How much of the wire should go to the square to minimize the total area enclosed by both figures?

 \{ans_rule(20)\} m

END_TEXT
