BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

Two vertical poles PQ and ST are secured by a rope PRS going
from the top of the first pole to a point R on the ground
between the poles and then to the top of the second pole as in
the figure. If R is chosen to minimize the length of the rope,
Find the ratio

$PAR

\(\dfrac{\theta _1}{\theta _2}\)

$PAR

in terms of a and b where a is the length of PQ and b is the length of ST.
