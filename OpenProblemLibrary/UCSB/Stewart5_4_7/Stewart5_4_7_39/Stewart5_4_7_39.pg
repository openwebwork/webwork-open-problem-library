In a beehive, each ell is a regular hexagonal prism, open at one end with a trihedal angle at the other end. It is believed that bees form their cells in such a way as to minimize the surface area for a given volume, thus using the least amount of wax in cell construction. Examination of these cells has shown that the measure of the apex angle \(\theta\) is amazingly consistent. Based on the geometry of the cell, it can be shown that the surface area S is given by

$PAR

\(S=6sh-\dfrac{3}{2}s^2 \cot \theta + (3s^2 \sqrt{3} /2) \csc \theta \)

$PAR

where s, the length of the sides of the hexagon, and h, the height, are constants.

$PAR

(a) Calculate \(dS/d \theta \). (Your answer may depend on s, h, and t (use t instead of theta)).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR

(b) What angle should bees prefer (in radians)?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR

(c) Determine the minimum surface area of the cell (Your answer may depend on s and h).

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\}
