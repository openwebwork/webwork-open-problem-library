BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

An observer stands at a point P, one unit away from a
track. Two runners start at the point S in the figure and run
along the track. One runner runs $a times as fast as the
other. Find the maximum value of the observer's angle of sight
\(\theta\) between the runners. [Hint: Maximize \(\tan \theta
\)]
