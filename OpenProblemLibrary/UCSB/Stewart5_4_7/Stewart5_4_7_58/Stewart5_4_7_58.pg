BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

A painting in an art gallery has height h and is hung so its
lower edge is a distance d above the eye of an observer (as in
the figure). How far from the wall should the observer stand
to get the best view? (In other words, where should the
observer stand so as to maximize the angle \(\theta\)
subtended at his eye by the painting?) (Your answer may depend
on h and d.)

$PAR

\{ image( "5et0407x58.gif", height => 150, width => 400, tex_size=>300 ) \}
$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\}

END_TEXT
