BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

The illumination of an object by a light source is directly proportional to the strength of the source and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. If two light sources, one $a times as strong as the other, are placed $b ft apart, how many feet from the brighter source should an object be placed on the line between the sources so as to receive the least illumination?
$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\} ft

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp($b*$a**(1/3)/(1+$a**(1/3))));
