BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds tend
to avoid flights over large bodies of water during daylight
hours. It is believed that more energy is required to fly over
water than land because air generally rises over land and
falls over water during the day. A bird with these tendencies
is released from an island that is 5 km from the nearest point
B on a straight shoreline, flies to a point C on the
shoreline, and then flies along the shoreline to its nesting
area D. Assume that the bird instinctively chooses a path that
will minimize its energy expenditure. Points B and D are 13 km
apart.

$PAR

(a) In general, if it takes 1.4 times as much energy to fly
over the water as land, how far should point C be from B in
order to minimize the total energy expended in returning to
its nesting area?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\} km

$PAR

(b) Let W and L denote the energy (in joules) per kilometer
flown over water and land respectively. Determine the ratio
W/L corresponding to the minimum energy expenditure given that
the bird flies to the shore at a point x kilometers from
B. (Your answer may depend only on x.)

$PAR

W/L = \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR

(c) If the ornithologists observe that birds of a certain species reach the shore at a point $a km from B, how many times more energy does it take this species to fly over water than land?
