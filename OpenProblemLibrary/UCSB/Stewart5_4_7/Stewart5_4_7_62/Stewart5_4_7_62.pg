BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

Two light sources of identical strength are placed 10 m
apart. An object is to be placed at a point P on a line l
parallel to the line joining the light sources and at a
distance d meters from it (see the figure). We want to locate
P on l so that the intensity of illumination is minimized. We
need to use the fact that the intensity of illumination for a
single source is directly proportional to the strength of the
source and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance from the source.

$PAR

\{ image( "4e0407x56.gif", height => 250, width => 600, tex_size=>300 ) \}
$PAR

(a) Find an expression for the intensity I(x) at the point
P. (Your answer may depend on x,d, and k where k is the
product of the proportionality constant and the strength of
the sources).

$PAR

I(x) = \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR

(b) If d = 5 m find the smallest value of x which minimizes the intensity.

$PAR

x = \{ans_rule(20)\} m

$PAR

(c) If d = 10 m find the smallest value of x which minimizes the intensity.

$PAR

x = \{ans_rule(20)\} m

$PAR

(d) Somewhere between d = 5 m and d = 10 m there is a
transitional value of d at which the point of minimal
illumination abruptly changes. Find this value for d.

$PAR

d = \{ans_rule(20)\} m
