Economists who study production of goods by a firm consider two functions. The revenue function \(R(x)\) is the revenue the firm receives when x number of units are sold. The cost function \(C(x)\) is the cost the firm incurs when producing x number of units. The derivatives of these functions \(R'(x)\) and \(C'(x)\) are called by economists the marginal revenue and cost function.

The figure shows graphs of the marginal revenue function \(R'\) and the marginal cost function \(C'\) for a manufacturer.    Assume that \(R\) and \( C\) are measured in thousands of dollars.
