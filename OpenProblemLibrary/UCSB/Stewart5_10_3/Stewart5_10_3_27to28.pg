TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In many cases, it can be easier to describe a curve with Cartesian coordinates.  Other times, polar coordinates may be easier.  Below, four curves are described in words, and four choices of equations are given -- two are in Cartesian form and two in polar form.  Match each description with the correct curve. $BR
