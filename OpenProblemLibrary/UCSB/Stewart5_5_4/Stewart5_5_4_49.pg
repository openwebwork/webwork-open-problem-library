	"Economists who study production of goods by a firm consider two functions. The revenue function \(R(x)\) is the revenue the firm receives when x number of units are sold. The cost function \(C(x)\) is the cost the firm incurs when producing x number of units. The derivatives of these functions \(R'(x)\) and \(C'(x)\) are called by economists the marginal revenue and cost function.  What does \(\int_{1000}^{\,5000} {R'(x)}\,dx\) represent?",
