BEGIN_TEXT

Economists use a cumulative distribution called a $BITALIC Lorenz curve $EITALIC to describe the distribution of income between households in a given country.  Typically, a Lorenz curve is defined on the \(x\)-interval [0, 1] with endpoints (0, 0) and (1, 1), and is continuous, increasing, and concave upward.  The points on this curve are determined by ranking all households by income and then computing the percentage of households whose income is less than or equal to a given percentage of the total income of the country.  For example, the point (a/100, b/100) is on the Lorenz curve if the bottom \(a\) $PERCENT of the households receive less than or equal to \(b\) $PERCENT of the total income.

$BITALIC Absolute equality $EITALIC of income distribution would occur if the bottom \(a\) $PERCENT of the households receive \(a\) $PERCENT of the income, in which case the Lorenz curve would be the line \(y = x\).  The area between the Lorenz curve and the line \(y = x\) measures how much the income distribution differs from absolute equality.  The $BITALIC coefficient of inequality $EITALIC is the ratio of the area between the Lorenz curve and the line \(y = x\) to the area under \(y = x\).

As it turns out, one could prove that the coefficient of inequality is twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the line \(y = x\), that is

\[\textrm{coefficient of inequality } = 2 \int_{0}^{\,1} x-L(x)\, dx.\]

$PAR$HR$PAR
Suppose that the income distribution for a certain country is represented by the Lorenz curve defined by the equation
\[L(x)=\frac{5}{12}x^2+\frac{7}{12}x.\]

$PAR
(a) What is the percentage of total income received by the bottom 50 $PERCENT of the households?

$PAR
Percentage of total income = \{ans_rule(20)\} $PERCENT

$PAR
(b) Find the coefficient of inequality.

$PAR
Coefficient of inequality = \{ans_rule(20)\}
