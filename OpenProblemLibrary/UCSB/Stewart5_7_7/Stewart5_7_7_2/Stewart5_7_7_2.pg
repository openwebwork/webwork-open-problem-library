The left, right, Trapezoidal, and Midpoint Rule approximations were used to estimate \(\int_{0}^{\,2} {f(x)}\, dx,\) where \(f\) is the function whose graph is shown below.  The estimates were 0.7811, 0.8675, 0.8632, and 0.9540, and the same number of subintervals were used in each case.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
(a)  $BR
Let \(L, R , T\) and \(M\) be the Left, Right, Trapezoidal, and Midpoint Rule approximations, respectively. $BR
Since the function is concave up, we have
\[ M \le \int_0^2 f(x) \, dx \le T \]
Since the function is decreasing, we have
\[ R \le \int_0^2 f(x) \, dx \le L \]
The above inequalities also imply that \(T\) is more accurate than \(L\) and \(M\) is more accurate than \(R\).
Therefore:
\[ R \le M \le \int_0^2 f(x) \, dx \le T \le L\]
Ordering the given values, gives:
\[ 0.7811 \lt 0.8632 \le \int_0^2 f(x) dx \le 0.8675 \lt 0.9540 \]
Thus
$BR
$BBOLD 1. $EBOLD Left-hand estimate = 0.9540
$BR
$BBOLD 2. $EBOLD Right-hand estimate = 0.7811
$BR
$BBOLD 3. $EBOLD Trapezoidal Rule estimate = 0.8675
$BR
$BBOLD 4. $EBOLD Midpoint  Rule estimate = 0.8632
$PAR $BR
(b) $BR
Since 
\( M \le \int_0^2 f(x) \, dx \le T \), we have that
\[ 0.8632 < \int_0^2 f(x)\,dx < 0.8975 \]
