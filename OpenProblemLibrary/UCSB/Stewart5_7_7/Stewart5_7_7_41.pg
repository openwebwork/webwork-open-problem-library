BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
The intensity of light with wavelength \(\lambda\) traveling through a diffraction grating with \(N\) slits at an angle \(\theta\) is given by 
\[I(\theta)=\frac{N^2 \sin^2(k)}{k^2},\]
where \(k=(\pi N d \sin(\theta))/\lambda\) and \(d\) is the distance between adjacent slits.  A helium-neon laser with wavelength \(\lambda=632.8 \times 10^{-9}\) meters is emitting a narrow band of light, given by \(-10^{-6} < \theta < 10^{-6},\) through a grating with 10,000 slits spaced \(10^{-4}\) meters apart.  Use the Midpoint Rule with \(n\) = 10 to estimate the total light intensity
\[\int_{-10^{-6}}^{\,10^{-6}} {I(\theta)}\, d\theta\]
emerging from the grating.

$PAR
Note: Make sure your answer is correct to four decimal places.

$PAR
Total light intensity \(\approx\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
