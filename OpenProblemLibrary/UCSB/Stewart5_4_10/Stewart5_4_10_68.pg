$PAR
Two balls are thrown upward from the edge of a cliff that is 432 ft above the ground.  The first is thrown with an initial speed of 48 ft/s, and the other is thrown a second later with a speed of 24 ft/s.  Let \(t\) be the number of seconds passed after the first ball is thrown.  Determine the value of \(t\) at which the balls pass, if at all.  If the balls do not pass each other, type "never" (in lower-case letters) as your answer.

$PAR
Note: Acceleration due to gravity is \(-32 ft/sec^2.\)

\(t =\) \{ans_rule(20)\}
