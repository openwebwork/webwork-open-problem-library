$PAR
Since raindrops grow as they fall, their surface area increases and therefore the resistance to their falling increases.  A raindrop has an initial downward velocity of 10 m/s, and its downward acceleration is
\[a = \begin{cases}
9-0.9t & \text{ if } 0 \le t \le 10 \quad \quad \\
0 & \text{ if } t > 10 \quad \quad  
\end{cases} \]
If the raindrop is initially 500 meters above the ground, how long does it take (in seconds) to fall?

$PAR
Time needed = \{ans_rule(20)\} seconds
