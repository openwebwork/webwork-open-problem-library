BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
A car is traveling at 100 km/h when the driver sees an accident 80 m ahead and slams on the brakes.  What constant acceleration (in \(km/h^2\)) is required to stop the car in time to avoid a pileup?  (Remember that acceleration is negative!)

$PAR
Constant acceleration = \{ans_rule(35)\} \(km/h^2\)
