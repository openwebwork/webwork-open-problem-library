BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
An object is thrown upwards with initial velocity \(w\) meters per second from a point \(d\) meters above the ground.  Assume that the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 meters per second squared, and let \(v(t)\) and \(s(t)\) denote the velocity and position of the object above the ground, respectively, after \(t\) seconds.

$PAR
(a) Determine a function that describes the velocity \(v\) of the object after time \(t\).

$PAR
\(v(t) =\) \{ans_rule(50)\}

$PAR
(b) Determine a function that describes the position \(s\) of the object after time \(t\).

$PAR
\(s(t) =\) \{ans_rule(50)\}

$PAR
(c) Use (a) and (b) to obtain a formula that relates the velocity \(v\) of 
the object with \(w\), \(s\), and \(d\).  Your formula should have the 
form \(v^2 = \cdots\)

$PAR
\(v^2 =\) \{ans_rule(50)\}
