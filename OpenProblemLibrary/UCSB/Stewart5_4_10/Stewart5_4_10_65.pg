$PAR
A stone is dropped from the upper observation deck (the Space Deck) of the CN Tower, 450 meters above the ground.

$PAR
(a) Find the distance \(s\) of the stone above ground level at time \(t\), where time is measured in seconds.

$PAR
\(s(t) =\) \{ans_rule(35)\}

$PAR
(b) How long (in seconds) does it take the stone to reach the ground?

$PAR
Time needed = \{ans_rule(20)\} seconds

$PAR
(c) With what velocity (in m/s) does it strike the ground?

$PAR
Velocity = \{ans_rule(20)\} meters per second

$PAR
(d) If the stone is thrown downward with a speed of $a m/s, how long does it take (in seconds) for the stone to reach the ground?

$PAR
Time needed = \{ans_rule(20)\} seconds
