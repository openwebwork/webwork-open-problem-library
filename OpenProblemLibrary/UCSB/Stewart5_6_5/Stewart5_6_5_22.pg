$PAR
The velocity \(v\) of blood that flows in a blood vessel with radius \(R\) and length \(l\) at a distance \(r\) from the central axis is 
\[v(r)=\frac{P}{4\eta l}(R^2-r^2),\]
where \(P\) is the pressure difference between the ends of the vessel and \(\eta\) is the viscosity of the blood.

$PAR$HR$PAR
(a) Find the average velocity \(v_{ave}\) (with respect to \(r\)) over the interval \(0 \le r \le R.\)

$PAR
Note: Your answer may contain \(\eta\), which is not a symbol on your keyboard.  In your answer, use a lower-case "n" in its place.

$PAR
Average velocity = \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR$HR$PAR
(b) Compare the average velocity \(v_{ave}\) with the maximum velocity \(V\).  How are they related?  Answer this by writing an equation that gives \(v_{ave}\) as a function of the maximum velocity \(V\).

$PAR
\(v_{ave} = \) \{ans_rule(30)\}
