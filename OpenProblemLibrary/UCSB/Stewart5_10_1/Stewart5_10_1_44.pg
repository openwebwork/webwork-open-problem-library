$PAR
If a projectile is fired with an initial velocity of \(V\) meters per second at an angle \(A\) above the horizontal and air resistance is assumed to be negligible, then its position after \(t\) seconds is given by the parametric equations
\[x = (V\cos(A))t, \quad y = (V\sin(A))t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2,\]
where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity (\(9.8\;m/s^2\)).

(a) If a gun is fired with \(A=30^{\circ}\) and \(V=500\;m/s,\) when (in seconds) will the bullet hit the ground?

$PAR
Time \(t =\) \{ans_rule(20)\} seconds

$PAR$HR$PAR
(b) Under the conditions of (a), how far (in meters) from the gun will it hit the ground? 

$PAR
Distance = \{ans_rule(20)\} meters

$PAR$HR$PAR
(c) Under the conditions of (a), what is the maximum height (in meters) reached by the bullet?

$PAR
Maximum height = \{ans_rule(20)\} meters

$PAR$HR$PAR
(d) Show that the path of the bullet is parabolic by eliminating the parameter to find a Cartesian equation that describes the path.  Your answer may depend on \(V\), \(A\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(g\).  If \(g\) appears in your answer, leave it in - do NOT substitute in \(g = 9.8\) in your answer!

$PAR
\(y =\) \{ans_rule(50)\}
