$PAR
Suppose that the position of one particle at time \(t\) is given by 
\[x_1 = 3\sin(t), \quad y_1 = 2\cos(t), \quad 0 \le t \le 2\pi\]
and the position of a second particle is given by 
\[x_2 = -3+\cos(t), \quad y_2 = 1+\sin(t), \quad 0 \le t \le 2\pi.\]

(a) How many points of intersection are there for these paths?

$PAR
Number of intersection points = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR$HR$PAR
(b) How many of these points of intersection are collision points?  In other words, how many times are the particles in the same place at the same time?

$PAR
Number of collision points = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR$HR$PAR
(c) List the collision points.  List them in terms of increasing \(x\)-coordinates.  If several collision points have the same \(x\)-coordinate, list those in order of increasing \(y\)-coordinates.  Type an upper-case "N" in each unused answer blank.

$PAR
First collision point: \((x, y)\) = (\{ans_rule(10)\}, \{ans_rule(10)\})

$PAR
Second collision point: \((x, y)\) = (\{ans_rule(10)\}, \{ans_rule(10)\})

$PAR
Third collision point: \((x, y)\) = (\{ans_rule(10)\}, \{ans_rule(10)\})

(d) Now suppose that the path of the second particle is given by
\[x_2 = 3+\cos(t), \quad y_2 = 1+\sin(t), \quad 0 \le t \le 2\pi\]
and the path of the first particle remains the same.  How many points of intersection are there for these paths?

$PAR
Number of intersection points = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR$HR$PAR
(e) For the situation described in (d), how many of these points of intersection are collision points?  

$PAR
Number of collision points = \{ans_rule(10)\}
