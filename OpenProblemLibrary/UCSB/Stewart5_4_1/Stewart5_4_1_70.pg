$PAR

An object with weight W is dragged along a horizontal plane by a force acting along a rope attached to the object. If the rope makes an angle \(\theta\) with the plane, then the magnitude of the force is

$PAR

\(F = \dfrac {\mu W} {\mu \sin ( \theta ) + \cos ( \theta ) } \)

$PAR

Where \(\mu\) is a positive constant called the coefficient of friction and where \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2 \). Find the value for \( \tan \theta \) which minimizes the force. Your answer may depend on W and \(\mu\), but use ${LQ}u${RQ} instead of \( \mu\) when entering your answer.

$BR

\( \tan \theta  = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
