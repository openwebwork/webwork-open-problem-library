$PAR

In a fish farm, a population of fish is introduced into a pond and is harvested regularly. A model for the rate of change of the fish population is given by the equation
\(\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt}= r_0 (1-\frac{P(t)}{P_c})P(t)-\beta P(t)\), where \(r_0\) is the birth rate of the fish, \(P_c\) is the maximum population that the pond can sustain, and \(\beta\) is the percentage of the population that can be harvested.$PAR

(a) What value of \(dP/dt\) corresponds to a stable population? $BR 
(b) If the pond can sustain 10,000 fish, the birth rate is 5 percent and the harvesting rare is 4 percent, find the stable population level.
