BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

If \(R\) denotes the reaction of the body to some stimulus of strength \(x\), the sensitivity \(S\) is defined to be the rate of change of the reaction with respect to \(x\). A particular example is that when the brightness \(x\) of a light source is increased, the eye reacts by decreasing the area \(R\) of the pupil. The experimental formula \(\displaystyle R=\frac{40+24x^{.4}}{1+4x^{.4}}\) has been used to model the dependence of \(R\) on \(x\) when \(R\) is measured in sq mm and \(x\) is measured in the appropriate units of brightness. $PAR

Find the sensitivity.
