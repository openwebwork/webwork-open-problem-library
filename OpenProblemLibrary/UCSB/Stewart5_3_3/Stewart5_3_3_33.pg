The gas law for an ideal gas at absolute temperature \(T\) (in kelvins), pressure \(P\) (in atmospheres), and volume \(V\) is \(PV=nRT\), where \(n\) is the number of moles of the gas and \(R=.0821\) is the gas constant. Suppose that, at a certain instant, \(P=8\) atm and is increasing at a rate of .10 atm/min and \(V=10\) L and is decreasing at a rate of .15 L/min. $BR
Find the rate of change of \(T\) with respect to time at that instant if \(n=10\) moles. Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.
