$PAR

The frequency of vibrations of a vibrating violin string is given by \(\displaystyle f=\frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho}}\), where \(L\) is the length of the string, \(T\) is the tension, and \(\rho\) is its linear density. $PAR

Find the rate of change of the frequency with respect to: $BR
(a) the length (when \(T\) and \(\rho\) are constant) $BR
(b) the tension (when \(L\) and \(\rho\) are constant) $BR
(c) the linear density (when \(L\) and \(T\) are constant) $PAR

The pitch of a note is determined by the frequency \(f\). (The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.) Use the signs of the derivatives in (a) through (c) to determine what happens to the pitch of a note: $PAR

(d) when the effective length of a string is decreased by placing a finger on the string so a shorter portion of the string vibrates. $BR
(e) when the tension is increased by turning a tuning peg. $BR
(f) when the linear density is increased by switching to another string. $PAR

*For parts (a) through (c), use "p" for "\(\rho\)". $BR
*For parts (d) through (f), enter "h" for higher note, or "l" for lower note.
