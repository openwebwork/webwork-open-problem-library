$PAR

If a ball is thrown vertically upward with a velocity of 80 ft/s, then its height after \(t\) seconds is \(s(t)= 80t-16t^2 \). $BR
(a) What is the maximum height reached by the ball? $BR
(b) What is the velocity of the ball when it is 96 ft above the ground on its way up? $BR
(c) What is the velocity of the ball when it is 96 ft above the ground on its way down?
