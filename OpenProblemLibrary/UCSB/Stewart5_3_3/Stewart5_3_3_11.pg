$PAR

(a) A company makes computer chips from square wafers of silicon. It wants to keep the side length of a wafer very close to 15 mm, and it wants to know how the area \(A(x)\) of a wafer changes when the side length \(x\) changes. $BR
Find \(A'(15)\). [Can you explain its meaning in this situation?] $PAR 

(b) What is the rate of change of the area of the square with respect to its side length when the perimeter is \($a \) mm?

$PAR

(a) \(A'(15)=\) \{ans_rule(20)\} sq mm/ mm $BR
(b) \(A'(?)=\) \{ans_rule(20)\} sq mm/mm
