$PAR

Newton's Law of Gravitation says that the magnitude \(F\) of the force exerted by a body of mass \(m\) on a body of mass \(M\) is \(\displaystyle F=\frac{GmM}{r^2}\), where \(G\) is the gravitational constant and \(r\) is the distance between the bodies. $PAR

(a) Find \(dF/dr\). [What does the minus sign mean?] $BR
(b) Suppose it is known that Earth attracts an object with a force that decreases at a rate of 2 N/km when \(r=20000\) km. How fast does this force change when \(r=10000\) km?

$PAR

(a) \(dF/dr=\)\{ans_rule(20)\} $BR 
(b) \{ans_rule(20)\} N/km
