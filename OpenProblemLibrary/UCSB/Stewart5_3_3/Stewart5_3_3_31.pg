$PAR

If \(p(x)\) is the total value of the production when there are \(x\) workers in the plant, then the ${BITALIC}average productivity${EITALIC} of the workforce at the plant is \(\displaystyle A(x)=\frac{p(x)}{x}\). $PAR

Find \(A'(x)\).  (Why does the company want to hire more people if \(A'(x)>0\)?) $BR
*Enter \(p(x)\) as "p" and \(p'(x)\) as "q" below. 
$PAR

\(A'(x)=\) \{ans_rule(20)\}
