$PAR
Household electricity is supplied in the form of alternating current that varies from 155 V to -155 V with a frequency of 60 cycles per second (Hz).  The voltage is thus given by the equation
\[E(t) = 155 \sin(120 \pi t),\]
where \(t\) is the time in seconds.  Voltmeters read the RMS (root-mean-square) voltage, which is the square root of the average value of \([E(t)]^2\) over one cycle.

$PAR$HR$PAR
(a) Calculate the RMS voltage of household current.

$PAR
RMS voltage = \{ans_rule(30)\}

$PAR$HR$PAR
(b) Many electric stoves require an RMS voltage of 220 V.  Find the corresponding amplitude \(A\) needed for the voltage \(E(t)=A \sin(120\pi t).\)

$PAR
{\it A} = \{ans_rule(30)\}
