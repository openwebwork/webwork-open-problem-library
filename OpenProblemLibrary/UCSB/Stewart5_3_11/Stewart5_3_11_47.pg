$PAR

Suppose \(u\) and \(v\) are differentiable functions of \(x\), and \(c\) is a constant. Write down the rules (and verify them) for the following: $PAR
(a) \(dc\) $BR
(b) \(d(cu)\) $BR
(c) \(d(u+v)\) $BR
(d) \(d(uv)\) $BR
(e) \(d(u/v)\) $BR
(f) \(d(x^c)\) $PAR
${BBOLD}*Below, use "du" for \(du\), "dv" for \(dv\), and "dx" for \(dx\). ${EBOLD}

$PAR
(a) \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
(b) \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
(c) \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
(d) \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
(e) \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
(f) \{ans_rule(30)\}
