$PAR

When blood flows along a blood vessel, the flux \(F\) (the volume of blood per unit time that flows past a given point) is proportional to the fourth power of the radius \(R\) of the blood vessel: \(F=kR^4\) (Poiseuille's Law). $PAR

A partially clogged artery can be expanded by an operation called angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inflated inside the artery in order to widen it and restore the normal blood flow. $PAR

It can be shown (do it) that the relative change in \(F\) is about four times the relative change in \(R\). So, how will a \(5\)$PERCENT increase in the radius affect the flow of blood?

$PAR

\{ans_rule(20)\} percent increase in blood flow.
