$PAR
One method of slowing the growth of an insect population without using pesticides is to introduce into the population a number of sterile males that mate with fertile females but produce no offspring.  If \(P\) represents the number of female insects in a population, \(S\) the number of sterile males introduced each generation, and \(r\) the population's natural growth rate, then the female population is related to time \(t\) by
\[t = \int {\frac{P+S}{P[(r-1)P-S]}}\, dP.\]

Suppose an insect population with 10,000 females grows at a rate of \(r\) = 0.10 and 900 sterile males are added.  Evaluate the integral to give an equation relating the female population to time.

$PAR
Note: The resulting equation $BBOLD cannot $EBOLD be solved explicitly for \(P\), so your final answer should have the form \(t =\) ...

$PAR
\(t =\) \{ans_rule(50)\}
