TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 Solve the following differential
equation.  As you know, indefinite integrals are used to solve these
equations and have an undetermined constant. In this exercise use
\(C=0\).
$BR
\( \displaystyle\frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}x} + 2y = x \)
$BR
\( y = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR 
Use the formula: \[\int x e^{2x}
\hbox{d} x = e^{2x} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{1}{4}\right).\] Of course, you
can check that formula easily by differentiation.  (Also, check your
solution of the differential equation by differentiation.)

$BR

$BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Recognize this as a first-order linear differential
equation and follow the general method for solving these.

EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR

$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Since \(
\displaystyle\frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}x} + 2y = x \), multiply both
sides by the integrating factor \( \displaystyle\int e^{2x}\hbox{d}x
\).  Then the left side may be interpreted as \( D_{x}(e^{2x}y) \).
To solve for \( y \), integrate both sides, using Integration By Parts
on the right to see, \( y = .5 x - .25 \)
