TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In a well known story the inventor of the game of chess was asked by
his well pleased King what reward he desired.  "Oh, not much, your
majesty", the inventor responded, "just place a grain of rice on the
first square of the board, 2 on the next, 4 on the next, and so on,
twice as many on each square as on the preceding one.  I will give this
rice to the poor."  (For the uninitiated, a chess board has 64 squares.)
The king thought this a modest request 
indeed and ordered the rice to
be delivered. 
$BR
 Let \(f(n)\) denote the number
of rice grains placed on the first n squares of the board.  So
clearly,
\(f(1)=1\), \(f(2) = 1+2 = 3\), \(f(3)= 1+ 2 + 4 =7 \), and so on.
How $BITALIC does$EITALIC it go on?  
Compute the next two values of \(f(n)\):
\(f(4) = \)  \{ ans_rule(5) \}

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
Supposing that there are 25,000 grains of rice in a
pound, 2000 pounds in a ton, and 6 billion people on earth, the
inventor's reward would work out to approximately
 \{ ans_rule(25) \} tons of rice for every person on the planet.
Clearly, all the rice in the kingdom would not be enough to begin to
fill that request. The story has a sad ending: feeling duped,
the king caused
the inventor of chess to be beheaded.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Note the relationship
between the number of grains on each square, and the number of grains
on the preceding squares combined.  
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
 Note that on each square there is one more grain of rice than on all of the 
preceding squares combined.  Thus on the second square there are two
grains, one more than the one on the first square.  On the third
square there are 4 grains, one more than on the first two.  On the
fourth square there are 8 grains, one more than on the first 3, etc.
Since we double the number of grains on successive squares, on the 
\((n+1)\)-th square there are \(2^n\) grains, and on the first \(n\)
squares combined there are \(2^n-1\) grains.  On the entire board
there are \(2^{64}-1\) grains.  The amount of rice per person is given
by the expression
\[\frac{2^{64}-1}{25,000\times 2,000\times 6,000,000,000} \approx 61.5 \hbox{~tons}.\]
