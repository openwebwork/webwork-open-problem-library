TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider the growth of a population \(p(t)\).  It starts out with \(p(0) = A\).
Suppose the growth is unchecked, and hence
\[p' = k p \] for some constant \(k\).

$PAR Then
\(p(t) = \) 
\{ans_rule(20)\}.


$PAR Of course populations don't grow forever.  Let's say there is a
stable population size \(Q\) that \(p(t)\) approaches as time passes.
Thus the speed at which the population is growing will approach zero
as the population size approaches \(Q\).  One way to model this is via
the differential equation

\[p' = kp(Q-p),\quad p(0) = A.\]

The solution of this initial value problem is
\(p(t) = \) 
\{ans_rule(40)\}.

ANS(fun_cmp("A*exp(k*t)", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["t","A","k"]));
ANS(fun_cmp("Q*A/(Q-A)*exp(k*Q*t)/(1+A/(Q-A)*exp(k*Q*t))", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2],[3,4]], vars=>["t","A","k","Q"]));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Separating variables gives
\[\frac{\hbox{d} p}{p(Q-p)} = \frac{1}{Q}
\left(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{Q-p}\right) 
\hbox{d} p = k \hbox{d} t.\]

Integrating gives
\[\frac{1}{Q}\left(\ln p - \ln (Q-p)\right) = \ln\left[\left(\frac{p}{Q-p}\right)^{1/Q}\right] = kt + C\]

Applying the exponential on both sides gives
\[\left(\frac{p}{Q-p}\right)^{1/Q} = Re^{kt}.\]
Taking both sides to the power \(Q\) gives

\[\frac{p}{Q-p} = Re^{kQt}.\]

Solving for \(p\) gives
\[p = \frac{QRe^{kQt}}{1+Re^{kQt}}\]

Since \(p(0) = A\) we have \(R = \frac{A}{Q-A}\).  Thus the
complete solution is

\[p(t) = \frac{QAe^{kQt}}{Q-A+Ae^{kQt}}.\]
