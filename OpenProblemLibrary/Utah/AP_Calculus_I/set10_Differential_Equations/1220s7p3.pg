TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A tank initially contains 200 gallons of brine, with 50 pounds of salt
in solution.  Brine containing $p pounds of salt per gallon is
entering the tank at the rate of $g gallons per minute and is is
flowing out at the same rate.  If the mixture in the tank is kept
uniform by constant stirring, find the amount of salt in the tank at
the end of 40 minutes.  
$BR
The amount of salt in the tank at the end of 40 minutes is
\{ans_rule(40)\} pounds.
EOT

$ans = 200*$p + (50 - 200*$p)*(2.718281828**(-$g/5));
ANS(num_cmp($ans));


$c1 = 200*$p;
$c2 = $c1-50;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR

$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \( y(t) \) be the number of pounds of salt
in the tank at time \( t \).  From the assumptions, we see that the  tank
gains $pg pounds of salt per minute.  Also, the tank is losing
$dg\(y\) pounds of salt per minute.  Thus, we have the differential
equation \[\frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}x} = $pg - $dg y \]
and the initial condition \[y(0) = 50.\]  This is a linear
differential equation that can be solved by multiplying with an
integrating factor, giving \[y(t) = $c1 - $c2 e^{-{$dg t}}.\] The
answer is this expression evaluated at \(t = 40\).
