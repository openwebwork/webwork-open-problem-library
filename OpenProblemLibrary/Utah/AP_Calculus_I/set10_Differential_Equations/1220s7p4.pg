TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A tank initially contains 50 gallons of brine, with 30 pounds of salt
in solution.  Water runs into the tank at $in  gallons per minute and
the well-stirred solution runs out at $out  gallons per minute.  How
long will it be until there are 25 pounds of salt in the tank?

$BR
The amount of time until 25 pounds of salt remain in the tank is
\{ans_rule(40)\} minutes.

EOT

$ans = 50*(($in/$out)**(1/5)-1);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

$BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD This problem is a bit complicated. Set up a
differential equation and separate variables.

EOT

$d = $in-$out;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR

$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \( y(t) \) be the number of pounds of salt
in the tank at time \( t \).  Salt is being removed from the tank at a
rate that is proportional to the ratio of $out and the amount of fluid
in the tank at time \(t\).  Thus we have the differential equation:

\[\frac{\hbox{d} y}{\hbox{d} t} = - \frac{$out y}{50 +  t}.\]

Separating variables gives:

\[\frac{\hbox{d} y}{y} = - \frac{$out }{50 +  t} \hbox{d} t.\]

Integrating on both sides gives 

\[\ln y = -$out \ln (50 +  t) + C.\]

Taking the exponential on both sides gives:

\[y = e^C(50 + t)^{-$out}.\]

To compute \(e^C\) we use the fact that  \(y = 30 \) when \(t=0\) which gives the equation
\[30 = e^C 50^{-$out }.\]
Thus \[e^C = 30\times 50^{$out  }\]
and
\[y(t) =  30\times 50^{$out }(50 +   t)^{-$out } = 
30\times\left(\frac{50}{50+t}\right)^$out.\]


Solving \(y(t)=25\) for \(t\) gives
\[t = 50\times\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{-1/5}-50\]
which equals approximately 1.857 minutes.
