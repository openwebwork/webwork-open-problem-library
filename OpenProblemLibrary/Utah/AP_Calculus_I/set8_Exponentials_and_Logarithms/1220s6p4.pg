$BBOLD Newton's Law of Cooling $EBOLD states that the rate at which an
object cools is proportional to the difference in temperature between
the object and the surrounding medium.  Thus, if an object is taken
from an oven at \($T0^{\circ}\)F and left to cool in a room at
\($room_temp^{\circ}\)F, its temperature \(T\) after \(t\) hours will
satisfy the differential equation

\[
  \dfrac{dT}{dt} = k (T - $room_temp).
\]

If the temperature fell to \($T1^{\circ}\)F in $t1 hour(s), what
will it be after $t2 hour(s)?

After $t2 hour(s), the temperature will be \{ans_rule(10)\} degrees F.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(y=T-$room_temp\) to turn the equation into
\(y'=ky\).  As with the other problems in this section, this leads to the
solution \(y=Ce^{kt}\).  When \( t = 0 \), \( T = $T0 \), thus
we can solve for \(C\).  When \( t= $t1, T = $T1 \),
thus we can solve for \(k\).  Now the formula is given in terms of
\( t \).  Plug in \(t = $t2\) to see \( y = $ans0 \), and therefore
\( T  = $ans^{\circ}\).
