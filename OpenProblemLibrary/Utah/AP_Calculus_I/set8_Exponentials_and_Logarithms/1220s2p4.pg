differentiation
exercise which will involve all three of our main rules: the product,
quotient, and chain rules.  You'll find the right derivative by
proceeding carefully and deliberately.  You may want to edit the
resulting expression in a separate file and then cut and paste it into
the answer window.  Find \[ \frac{dr}{dx} \] if \[ r = \frac{\ln
x}{x^2 \ln x^2} + (\ln \frac{1}{x})^3 \]

ANS(fun_cmp("(x*ln(x^2)-(2*x*ln(x^2)+2*x)*ln(x))/x^4/(ln(x^2))^2 - 3*(ln(1/x))^2/x", limits=>[2,3], vars=>"x"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Applying the quotient rule to the first
summand involves an application of the product rule.  Then apply the
power and chain rules to the second summand.  Your answer should be
equivalent to the expression  
\[\frac{x\ln x^2 - (2x\ln x^2 + 2x)\ln x}{x^4(\ln x^2)^2}
-3\frac{ \left(\ln\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}{x}.\]
