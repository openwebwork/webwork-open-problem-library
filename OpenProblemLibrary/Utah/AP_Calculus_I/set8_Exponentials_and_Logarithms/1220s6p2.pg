TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The magnitude \(M\) on the Richter scale of an earthquake as a
function of its intensity \(I\) is given by
\[ M = \log_{10}\left( \frac{I}{I_{0}} \right),\]
where \(I_{0}\) is some fixed reference level of intensity.

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake had a magnitude of 8.3 on the
Richter scale.  Suppose that at the same time in South America there
was an earthquake with magnitude $a1 that caused only minor damage.
How many times more intense was the San Francisco earthquake than the
South American one?

$PAR


Answer:  \{ans_rule(20)\}

EOT

$ans = 10**(8.3-$a1);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD You don't need to know what \( I_{0} \) is.  Plug in
the respective magnitudes and use the log properties you know to
compare the resulting values for \( I \) in terms of this \( I_{0}\).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Follow the hint and plug in the magnitude of 8.3
and solve for \(I\).  Do the same after plugging in the magnitude of
$a1.  Compare the two values of \(I\).  The larger is = $ans times as
intense as the lesser.
