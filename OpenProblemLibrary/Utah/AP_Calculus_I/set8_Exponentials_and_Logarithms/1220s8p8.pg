TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
An airplane flys at a
constant altitude of $h miles and a constant speed of 600 miles per
hour on a straight course that will take it directly over a kangaroo
on the ground.  How fast is the angle of elevation of the kangaroo's
line of sight increasing when the distance from the kangaroo to the
plane is $d miles?  Give your answer in radians per minute.

Answer: \{ans_rule(20)\}.

$BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The angle of elevation is that angle that the line of
sight makes with the horizontal.  Construct a triangle representing
the situation.  Use this to get a equation first involving \( x \) and
\( y \), then differentiate to involve \(
\displaystyle\frac{\hbox{d}x}{\hbox{d}t} \) and \(
\displaystyle\frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}t} \).  Think about what it
means that the plane is getting $BBOLD closer$EBOLD to the kangaroo.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Construct a triangle which represents the given
situation.  Let \( y \) be the distance between the plane and the
kangaroo at a time \( t\).  Similarly, let \( x \) be the horizontal
distance.  Since the plane stays 2 miles above ground we have a right
triangle, with height $h, base \( x \), and hypotenuse \( y \).  From
this we use the Pythagorean Theorem to express \(\theta\).


 \[ x^2 + 4 = y^2.\] 

Thus 

\[ 2x\frac{\hbox{d}x}{\hbox{d}t} = 2y\frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}t}. \]


Since the plane is getting $BBOLD closer$EBOLD to the kangaroo as time
passes, \( \frac{\hbox{d}x}{\hbox{d}t} \) = \( -600 \) miles per hour
and thus

\[\frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}t} =- \frac{600 x}{y}.\]

$BR When the plane is $d miles from the kangaroo we have

\[ \frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}t} = 
\frac{(\sqrt{$d^2 -
$h^2})(-600)}{$d} \] miles per hour.


$BR We see from the triangle that the angle of elevation, \( \theta \),
can be expressed

\[ \theta = \sin^{-1}( \frac{$h}{y}) \] 

The derivative gives

$BR \[ \frac{\hbox{d}\theta}{\hbox{d}t} = \frac{$h}{y^2 \sqrt{1 -
\frac{$h^2}{y^2}}} \frac{\hbox{d}y}{\hbox{d}t}  \]

Substituting \( y = $d \) and the above value of \(y'\), and
converting hours to minutes gives $Ans radians per minute.
