TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A free hanging cylindrical rope will break under its own weight if it
exceeds a certain critical length.  Suppose you have a well that's
deeper than the critical length of your rope, and you need a rope
that will reach the bottom of that well.

A rope will break at any point if the stress at that point
exceeds a certain critical value.  The stress is the ratio of the
weight below that point and the area of the cross section at that
point.  Thus it does not help to increase the radius of the rope by a
certain factor.  You'd increase the weight and the area of the cross
section by the square of that factor. When computing the stress those
squares would cancel.  The critical length of a cylindrical rope is
independent of its radius.

However, you can increase the depth a rope can reach by increasing its
radius towards the top.  This problem explores that idea.  The rope
will break when the stress \(s\) at a certain point exceeds a specific
value \(c\).  That critical value \(c\) depends on the material of which
the rope is made.  So we want to construct a rope which has a constant
stress everywhere along the rope, and that carries a weight \(w\),
say.

Putting this information into mathematical terms we obtain the equation

\[\frac{u \int_0^x \pi r^2(t) \hbox{d}t  + w}{\pi r^2(x)} = c\]

or 

\[u \int_0^x \pi r^2(t) \hbox{d}t  + w = c{\pi r^2(x)}\]


for all \(x\).  Here

$BR

$BR \(u\) is the specific weight of the rope

$BR \(r(x)\) is the radius of the rope at a distance \(x\) measured
upwards from its bottom

$BR \(w\) is the weight carried by the rope.

$BR \(c\) is the critical stress (incorporating any safety factors).

$BR

Differentiate with respect to \(x\) in the above equation, obtain a
differential equation for \(r\), determine \(r(0)\) by the fact that
\(w\) is attached at \(x=0\) and enter the radius of your special
rope: $BR

\(r(x) = \)  \{ans_rule(80)\}.
$BR
Of course, your answer will depend on \(x\), \(w\), \(u\), and \(c\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Differentiating in 
\[u \int_0^x \pi r^2(t) \hbox{d}t  + w = c{\pi r^2(x)}\qquad (*)\]
gives
\[u\pi r^2(x) = c2\pi r(x) r'(x).\]
Solving for \(r'(x)\) gives the differential equation
\[r'(x) = \frac{u}{2c} r(x) \]
which has the solution
\[r(x) = C \exp\left(\frac{u}{2c}x\right). \]
To determine \(C= r(0)\) we set \(x=0\) in \((*)\) and obtain
\[w = c\pi r^2(0) \]
which gives
\[r(0) = \sqrt{\frac{w}{c\pi}}.\]
Hence
\[r(x)=  \sqrt{\frac{w}{c\pi}}  \exp(\frac{u}{2c}x)\]
which is the required answer.
