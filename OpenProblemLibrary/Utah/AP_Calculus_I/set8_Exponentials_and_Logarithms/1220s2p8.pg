TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The rate of transmission in a telegraph cable is observed to be
proportional to
\[x^2 \ln(1/x)\] where \(x\) is the ratio of the radius of the core to the
thickness of the insulation \((0 < x < 1)\).  What value of \(x\) gives the
maximum rate of transmission?

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Think about what does 'proportional' means in
this case.  Essentially, this means that the rate of transmission is a
constant multiple of the expression given.  Write the rate, \(R\), this
way, differentiate and apply your knowledge of rates of change and
maxima and minima to solve for \(x\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Following the hint, we write \( R = Cx^2 \ln
( \frac{1}{x} ) \) where \(C\) is some constant.  Clearly, the value of
\(x\) that minimizes \(R\) is independent of \(C\).  We differentiate,
set this new expression equal to 0 and solve for \(x\).  This gives the answer
of x = \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{e}}\).
