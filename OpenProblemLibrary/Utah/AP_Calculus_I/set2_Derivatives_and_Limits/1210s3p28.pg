Actually, once you get the hang of it, you'll prefer using variable
rather than numbers, and putting in the numbers only at the end of the
calculation.  So let's do the previous problem in general.  However,
since we are not likely to leave Earth, let's continue with \(g=32\)
feet per second squared.  (To write the solution of this problem I did
very little beyond taking the solution of the previous problem and
replacing 600 with \(d\) throughout.)

$BR

You shoot an arrow at an angle of 45
degrees.  It
hits the ground at a distance of
\(d\) feet.  The arrow left the bow
at a speed of \{ ans_rule(20) \}
miles per hour.

ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt(32*d)/5280*3600", limits=>[[1,2]], vars=>["d"]));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The speed of the arrow is measured in the
direction in which it flies. The significance of shooting at an angle
of 45 degrees is that initially the horizontal and the vertical
components of the speed are equal.  There are 3600 seconds in an hour
and 5280 feet in a mile.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Suppose \(v\) is the speed of the arrow.
Since the initial horizontal and vertical speeds are the same we have
\[V=v_v(0) = v_h(0) =v\cos45^\circ= \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}.\] Since the
initial height is zero we have \[h(t) = -16t^2+Vt.\] Solving
\(h(t)=0\) gives the time of impact: \[t_{\hbox{impact}} =
\frac{V}{16}.\] During that time the arrow covers a distance of \(d\)
feet at the speed \(V\).  This gives \[\frac{V^2}{16} = d\] or
\[V=\sqrt{16\times d}\quad\hbox{feet/second}.\] We need to multiply
with \(\sqrt{2}\) to get the speed \(v\), and we need to convert from
feet per second to miles per hour.  Thus \[v = \frac{3600\sqrt{2\times
16\times d}}{5280} \approx 3.8569\sqrt{d} \quad\hbox{mph}.\]
