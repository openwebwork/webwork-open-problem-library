TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider the absurd statement: 
$BCENTER$BBOLD
All numbers are equal
$EBOLD
$ECENTER

$PAR Figure out what is wrong with the proof below and email me your
explanation.  I will forward the best explanations to the class, with
your name attached.

$PAR $BBOLD Proof:$EBOLD  Let \(n\) be a natural number. Let \(S_n\)
be the statement that in a set of \(n\) numbers all numbers are equal.
I shall prove by induction that \(S_n\) is true for all natural
numbers \(n=1,2,3,\ldots\).

$PAR Clearly, \(S_1\) is true.  If a set contains just one number then
all numbers in that set are equal.

$PAR I now need to show that the truth of \(S_k\) implies the truth of
\(S_{k+1}\).  (Note: In class I used \(n\) instead of \(k\).  I m
hoping that \(k\) is clearer.  Using \(k\) instead of \(n\) is not the
problem.)  Let \[M= \lbrace a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{k+1}\rbrace\] be a
set of \(k+1\) numbers.  Then the subset \[M_1= \lbrace a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_{k}\rbrace\] of \(M\) contains \(k\) numbers, and by the
induction hypothesis these are all equal.  Similarly, the subset
\[M_2= \lbrace a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{k+1}\rbrace\] of \(M\) contains
\(k\) numbers all of which are equal.

$PAR

In other words, we have

\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
a_1 &= & a_2 & = & \ldots  & = & a_k & \\
& & a_2 & = & \ldots  & = & a_k & = & a_{k+1} \\
\end{array}
\]

Together these equations imply that
\[a_1 \quad = a_2 \quad = \quad  \ldots  \quad = a_k \quad  = a_{k+1} \]
Thus all the numbers in \(M\) are equal. QED
