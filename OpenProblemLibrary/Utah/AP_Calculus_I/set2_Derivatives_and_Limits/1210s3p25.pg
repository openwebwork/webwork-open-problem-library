Assume a free falling object accelerates at \(g\) feet
per second. (On Earth, of course, \(g=32\).) Your answers will be
mathematical expressions involving \(g\), \(V\), and \(H\).

$BR
You toss a rock up vertically at an initial speed of \(V\) feet per
second and release it at an initial height of \(H\) feet.  The rock will
remain in the air for
\{ ans_rule(20) \} seconds.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As discussed in an earlier problem, 
 \[h(t) = -\frac{1}{2}g t^2 + Vt + H\]
The hight reaches its maximum value when 
\[v(t) = h'(t) = -gt + V=0\]
Thus the maximum height is reached after 
\[t=\frac{V}{g} \hbox{seconds}.\]
Substituting in the height formula gives the height at that time:
\[h_{\max} = -\frac{1}{2}g \left(\frac{V}{g}\right)^2 + \frac{V^2}{g} +H = \frac{V^2}{2g}+H \quad\hbox{feet}.\]
To find the time the rock stays in the air we solve the quadratic equation
\[h(t) = 0\] which gives the time of impact:
\[t_{\hbox{impact}} = \frac{V+\sqrt{V^2+2gH}}{g}.\]
