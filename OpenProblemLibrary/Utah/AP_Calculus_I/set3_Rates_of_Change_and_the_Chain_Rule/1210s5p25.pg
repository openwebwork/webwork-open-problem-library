TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A child is flying a kite. If the kite is $h feet above the child's hand
level and the wind is blowing it on a horizontal course at $v feet per
second, the child is paying out cord at
\{&ans_rule(15)\} feet per second
when $s feet of cord are
out.  Assume that the cord remains straight from hand to kite.  (If
you have ever flown a kite you know that this is an unrealistic
assumption.)
