SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Suppose the point at which the space
travelers shuts off the engines is \(P=(z,z^2)\). The slope of the
tangent at that point is \(2z\).  We want that tangent to pass
through the point \((4,15)\).  Any line of slope \(2z\) passing
through \((4,15)\) can be written as \[y-15 = 2z(x-4).\] We want that
line to pass through \((z,z^2)\).  This gives the quadratic equation
\[z^2-15 = 2z(z-4)\] which has the solutions \(z=3\) and \(z=5\).  The
first value of \(z\) gives the point \((3,9)\) which is where the
spacer traveler shuts off her engines when traveling from the left.
The second value gives the point \((5,25\)) where she shuts off her
engines when traveling from the right.
