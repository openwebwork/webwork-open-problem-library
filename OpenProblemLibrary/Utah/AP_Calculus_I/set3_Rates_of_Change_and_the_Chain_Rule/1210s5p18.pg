TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A street light is at the top of a \(!{$poleHeight:%5.1f}\) ft. tall pole.
A man \(!{$manHeight:%5.1f}\) ft tall walks away from the pole with a speed of
\(!{$speed:%5.1f}\) feet/sec along a straight path.  How fast is the tip of his
shadow moving when he is \(!{$distance:%5.0f}\) feet from the pole?
$BR Your answer:
\{ &ans_rule(20) \} ft/sec
EOT

$ans=$speed*$manHeight/($poleHeight-$manHeight) + $speed;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format=>"%0.4f", relTol=>1));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(h\) be the height of the man, \(H\)
the height of the street light, \(d\) the (horizontal) distance of the
man from the light, and \(s\) the length of the man's shadow.  By
similar triangles we have \[\frac{s}{h} = \frac{s+d}{H}.\] Here, \(h\)
and \(H\) are constant, and \(s\) and \(d\) are functions of time.
Differentiating implicitly gives \[\frac{s'}{h} = \frac{s'+d'}{H}.\]
Solving for \(s'\) gives \[s'=\frac{d'h}{H-h}.\] The tip of the shadow
is moving at the combined speed \(v\) of the man and the speed at
which the shadow is growing.  Thus \[v=\frac{d'h}{H-h} + d'.\]
Substituting \[d'=$speed,\quad h = $manHeight,\quad\hbox{and}\quad H =
$poleHeight\] gives \[v \approx!{$ans:%5.3f}\hbox{~feet per second}.\]
Remarkably, the speed of the tip of the shadow is independent of the
distance of the man from the lamp post.  The information that
\(d=$distance\) is a red herring.
