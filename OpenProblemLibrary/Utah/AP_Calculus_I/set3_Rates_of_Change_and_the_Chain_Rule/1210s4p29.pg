TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Your neighbor is growing a slightly different watermelon.
It also has a rind whose thickness is one tenth of the radius of that
watermelon.  However, the rind of your neighbor's water melons grows 
at a $BBOLD constant$EBOLD rate of 20 cubic centimeters a week.  The radius of your
neighbor's watermelon after \(5\) weeks is \{ans_rule(20) \} and at
that time it is growing at

$pi = 2.0*acos(0.0); 
$alpha = (60/(4*$pi*(1-0.9**3)))**(1/3);
ANS(num_cmp($alpha*5**(1/3)));

\{ans_rule(20) \} centimeters per week.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($alpha*5**(-2/3)/3));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD When the water melon has a radius \(r\) the
volume of its rind is \[R(t) = \frac{4\pi(r^3- (0.9r)^3)}{3}.\] 
After \(t\) weeks the volume of the rind is
\(20t\) cubic centimeters.  We solve the equation
\[R(t) = 20 t\] for \(r\) and obtain:
\[r(t) = \alpha t^\frac{1}{3}\]
where \[\alpha = \displaystyle \root 3 \of {\frac{60}{4\pi (1-0.9^3)}}\approx 2.6021.\]
Hence
\[r' = \frac{\alpha}{3}t^{-\frac{2}{3}}.\]

Substituting \(t=5\) gives the answers:

\[r(5)\approx 4.45 \hbox{~centimeters}\quad\hbox{and}\quad r'(5) = 0.297 \hbox{~centimeters/week} .\]

$BR You tell your neighbor to get rid of his wimpy watermelon.
