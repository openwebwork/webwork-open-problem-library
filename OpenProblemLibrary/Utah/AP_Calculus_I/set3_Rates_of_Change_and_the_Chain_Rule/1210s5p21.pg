TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of
\(!{$flowRate:%5.0f} \) cubic centimeters per minute at the same time
that water is being pumped
 into the tank at a constant rate.  The tank has height
\(!{$height:%5.0f}\) meters and the diameter at the top is
\(!{$diameter:%5.1f}\) meters.  If the water level is rising at a rate
of \( !{$levelRate:%5.0f}\) centimeters per minute when the height of
the water is \(! {$level:%5.1f}\) meters, find the rate at which water
is being pumped into the tank in cubic centimeters per minute.  
$BR
Your answer:
\{ &ans_rule(30) \} cubic centimeters per minute.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The volume \(V\) of a cone of diameter \(d\) and
height \(h\) is 
\[V=\frac{\pi d^2 h }{12}.\]
We might as well do this problem a little more generally than
stated.  (It actually makes things clearer to use variables throughout
and substitute specific values only at the end.) So suppose the
diameter of our tank is \(D\) and its height is \(H\).  Suppose the
depth of the water is \(h\) and the radius of the surface is \(r\).
Then, by similar triangles,
\[\frac{r}{h} = \frac{R}{H},\]
or
\[r= \frac{Rh}{H}.\]
Substituting in the volume formula gives
\[V= \frac{\pi D^2h^3}{12H^2}.\]
Differentiating gives:
\[V'= \frac{3\pi D^2h^2h'}{12H^2} = \frac{\pi D^2h^2h'}{4H^2}\]
This rate of change in volume would be the rate \(T\) at which water
is being pumped into the tank if there was no leak.  However, if \(L\)
is the leak rate then
\[T = L+\frac{\pi D^2h^2h'}{4H^2}.\]

Note that since we have to have consistent t units, and the answer is
in cubic centimeters per minute, the lengths given in meters have to
be converted to centimeters.

Thus, substituting 
\[L= !{$flowRate:%5.0f},\quad D=!{$diametercm:%5.1f},\quad H=!{$heightcm:%5.0f},
\quad h =!{$levelcm:%5.0f},\quad h' = !{$levelRate:%5.0f}\]
we obtain
\[T \approx !{$ans:%5.0f}\  \hbox{cubic centimeters per minute.}\]
