SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As discussed in class, we solve any equation by doing the same thing
on both sides of the equation until we have the unknown by itself.  We
carefully write down what we are doing, and $BBOLD we never obliterate 
what we wrote. $EBOLD Thus we can check our work and recover from any 
mistakes.
In this case we obtain
\[\begin{array}{rclcl}
3 (x+ 2)+4 &=& -5 (x - 1)-2 &|& \hbox{distribute} \\
3x+6+4 &=& -5x+5-2 &|& \hbox{collect terms} \\
3x+10 &=& -5x+3 &|& + 5x -10 \\
8x &=& -7 &|& \div 8 \\
x  &=& -\frac{7}{8}&|& \hbox{the answer} \\
\end{array}
\]
Of course we check the answer (by substituting the solution in the
$BITALIC original$EITALIC equation).  We obtain:
\[3\left(-\frac{7}{8}+2\right)+4 = \frac{59}{8} = -5\left(-\frac{7}{8}-1\right)-2.\]
