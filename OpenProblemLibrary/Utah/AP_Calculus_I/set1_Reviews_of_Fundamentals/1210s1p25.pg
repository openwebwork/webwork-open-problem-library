TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Jamestown is 10 miles downstream from Aliceville and on the opposite
side of a river half a mile wide.  Mary will run from Aliceville along
the river for 6 miles, and then swim diagonally (i.e., along a
straight line) across the river to Jamestown.  If she runs at 8 miles
per hour and swims at three miles per hour she will reach Jamestown
after \{ ans_rule(20) \} hours.  Assume that the current is negligible.

$BR $BBOLD Note$EBOLD that unless otherwise specified WeBWorK expects your
answer to be within "one tenth of one percent" of the "true answer"
which is the answer it has been given by the author of the problem.
Practically speaking this means you should specify at least 4 digits
total (including any before the decimal point).  To be safe, you want
to compute your answer with your calculator much more accurately.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Mary runs 6 miles along the river at 8 miles
per hour.  Her course across the river is the hypotenuse of a right
triangle where the two short sides are half a mile and four miles
long, respectively.  The length of that hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{4^2 +
(1/2)^2}\).
Since she swims at 3 miles per hour the total time \(t\) for her trip is
\[t = \frac{6}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{16+\frac{1}{4}}}{3} \approx
2.094\hbox{hours}.\]
Mary is quite an athlete!
