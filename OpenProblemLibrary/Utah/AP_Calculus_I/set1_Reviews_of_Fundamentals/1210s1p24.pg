TEXT(beginproblem());

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Assume that the cutoff value for an A is 90 and the weight of all ww 
homeworks is 42$PERCENT.
Suppose you obtain 100 percent credit on all WeBWorK assignments in
this class.  Then the minimum average percentage on the exams that
will still get you an A in this class is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  Your
answer should be a number between 0 and 100.  You may enter a fraction.
EOT

$w=42;
$a=90;

$answer = ($a-$w)*100/(100-$w);




ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

$p = int(100*$answer);
$p = $p/100;
$rem = $a-$w;
$m =100-$w;

of percent in this question.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The main source of confusion in this problem
is the fact that the word $BITALIC percent$EITALIC  means three different
things: the percent you get over all in the class, the percent that
the home works count towards your grade, and the percent you obtain on your
exams.  Let's call the overall percent $BITALIC points$EITALIC.  According to the
syllabus you need $a points to get an A.  The WeBWorK account for $w
points, and since you get all of those (100 percent) you get $w points
from the home works.  So you need $rem more points from the exams.  
The maximum number of points from the exams is $m , and $rem is
\[p=\frac{100\times $rem}{$m}\approx $p\]
percent of $m points.  So you need to get at least 
$p percent on the exams, on average.
