TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Recall that the natural numbers are \[1,2,3,\ldots,\] the integers are
\[\ldots,-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots,\] rational numbers are ratios
of integers (with the denominator being non-zero), and real numbers
are all numbers corresponding to points on the number line.  You can also
think of real numbers as repeating or non-repeating decimals.  There
are more technical definitions which you will learn in real analysis.

$BR
Indicate whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).
