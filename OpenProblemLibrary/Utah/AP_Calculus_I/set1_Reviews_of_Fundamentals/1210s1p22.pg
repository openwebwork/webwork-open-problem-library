TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
You drop a rock into a deep well.  You can't see the rock's impact at
the bottom, but you hear it after $t seconds.  The depth of the well is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} feet. 
Ignore air resistance.
The time that passes after you drop the rock has two components: the time it 
takes the rock to reach the bottom of the well, and the time that it
takes the sound of the impact to travel back to you. Assume the speed
of sound is 1100 feet per second.
$BR Note: After \(t\) seconds the rock has reached a depth of \(d\) feet where  \[d = 16t^2.\]

quadratic equation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's do a little more than the problem requires and compute the
depth \(d\) of the well as a function of the time \(t\) at which we
hear the impact. Let's also denote the speed of sound by \(c\) and
gravity by \(g\).  
Clearly,
\[t = t_d+t_s \]
where \(t_d\) is the time that the rock takes to reach the bottom, and
\(t_s\) is the time the sound of the impact takes to travel back to your ear. 
The latter is easy to determine,:
\[t_s = \frac{d}{c}.\]
As discussed in class, the 
equation governing the flight of the rock
is
\[h(t)  =-\frac{g}{2}t^2  + v_0 t + h_0.\]

In our case the original height and velocity are zero, and instead of
height we are interested in depth, which is the negative of height.
Hence, when the rock reaches the bottom of the well we have that
\[h(t) = -\frac{g}{2}t_d^2 = -d.\] Thus \[t_d=\sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}}.\]
We have to solve the equation \[t_s+t_d = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} +
\frac{d}{c} = t\] for \(d\).  The key step is to recognize that this
is a quadratic equation, not in \(d\) but in the square root of \(d\).
Let's call it \(u\): \[u = \sqrt{d}\]

Then the equation turns into: \[t-\sqrt{\frac{2}{ g}} u - \frac{u^2}{
c} = 0.\] We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula. You
may be comfortable doing that, and while I think that you are wasting
your energy burdening your mind with arcane information like the
quadratic formula, for the purposes of this assignment that's just
fine. As for myself, I can never remember that formula, and memorizing
formulas is error prone anyway. What if I misremember or misapply a
formula? So in this discussion, we complete the square.  We obtain
after multiplying with \(-c\) and rearranging:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{  g} } cu - ct &=& 0 \\
u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{ g} }cu +  \frac{c^2}{ 2g} &=&  \frac{c^2}{ 2g}  + ct  \\
\left(u + \frac{1 }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \right)^2 &=&
 ct + \frac{c^2 }{ 2g}
\end{array}
\]
and therefore:
\[u = - \frac{1  }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \pm \sqrt{
  ct + \frac{c^2}{ 2g}}.\]
We know that if \(t\) is 0 then \(d\), and therefore \(u\), must be 0 also.
To get \(u=0\) we must choose the positive sign.  The
solution with the negative sign is an artifact of solving a quadratic
equation.  We also
need to square on both sides of this equation to get \(d\).  After a
slight rearrangement we obtain:

\[d = u^2 = \left( - \frac{ c }{  \sqrt{2g}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 }{ 2 g}  + ct} \right)^2.\]
 This is the desired formula.

Plugging in
\[c=1100,\qquad g=32,\qquad t=$t\]
gives the required answer: the depth is $depth feet.
