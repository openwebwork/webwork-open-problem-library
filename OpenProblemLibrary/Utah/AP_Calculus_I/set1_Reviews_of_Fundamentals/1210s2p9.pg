This problem is concerned with the 
$BITALIC composition$EITALIC of functions, and 
the fact that this is different from the $BITALIC multiplication$EITALIC of functions.
If \(f\) and \(g\) are two functions then their $BITALIC product$EITALIC \(fg\) is defined by
\[(fg) (x) = f(x)  g(x).\]
As usual, the absence of an arithmetic operator
denotes multiplication.  
$BR The $BITALIC composition$EITALIC \(f\circ g\) of these two functions is quite
different.  We evaluate first one, and then the other.  Thus \[(f\circ
g)(x) = f\big(g(x)\big).\]


$PAR
Let \(f(x) = $a1 x + $b1 \) and \(g(x) = $c1 x^2 + $d1 x \).
$PAR
\( (fg)($e1) = \) \{ans_rule(30) \}

$ans = ($a1*$e1 + $b1) * ($c1*$e1**2 + $d1*$e1);
