TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose the
speed of sound is \(c\), and gravity is \(g\).  If you throw a
rock from an initial height \(h_0\) and with an initial velocity
\(v_0\) the height \(h(t)\) of the rock after time \(t\) is \[h(t)
=-\frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_0 t + h_0.\] (The $BITALIC height$EITALIC is negative when
the rock is below ground level.  Thus you can think of $BITALIC depth$EITALIC as
negative $BITALIC height$EITALIC.) 

$PAR Suppose you throw the rock down a well and hear the impact after \(t\)
seconds.  Then the depth of this well is
$BR
\(d=\) \{ans_rule(40)\}.  
$BR
(Your answer will be a mathematical expression involving \(t\), \(g\), and \(c\).)
$BR
EOT
$ans= "(-c/sqrt(2*g)+sqrt(c**2/(2*g)+c*t))**2";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans, limits=>[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["t","g","c"]));

Set up and solve a
quadratic equation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We obtain

\[d = \left( - \frac{ c }{  \sqrt{2g}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 }{ 2 g}  + ct} \right)^2.\]

You can enter this expression into ww for example by typing
$BR
$BITALIC (-c/sqrt(2*g)+sqrt(c**2/(2*g)+c*t))**2$EITALIC
