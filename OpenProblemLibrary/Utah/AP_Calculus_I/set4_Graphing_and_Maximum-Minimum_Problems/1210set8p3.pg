SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD As usual let's do this problem more generally.
It's actually exactly like our earlier problems where we asked for the maximum height of a rock tossed vertically upwards.
Let \(s(t)\) be the distance covered by the car \(t\) seconds after 
stepping on the brakes.
Suppose the car decelerates at \(g\) feet per second squared. Then
\[s''(t) = -g\]
and
\[s'(t) = -gt + v_0\]
where \(v_0\) is the speed of the car at time 0.
Integrating again gives
\[s(t) = -\frac{gt^2}{2} + v_0t. \]
The integration constant in this case is \(0\) since at time \(t=0\) the car has covered a distance of \(0\) feet.
We are asking how far the car travels until it comes to a stop.  At that time 
the speed is \(0\), which gives
\[t = \frac{v_0}{g}.\]
Substituting this time into the distance formula gives
\[s = -\frac{gv_0^2}{2g^2}+ \frac{v_0^2}{g} = 
   -\frac{v_0^2}{2g}+ \frac{v_0^2}{g} = \frac{v_0^2}{2g}.\]
Substituting 
\[v_0=!{$initialSpeed:%5.0f} ft/sec, \quad g=
!{$decelerationRate:%5.0f} ft/sec^2 \]
gives the answer:
\[s \approx !{$distance:%5.2f}\hbox{~feet.}\]
