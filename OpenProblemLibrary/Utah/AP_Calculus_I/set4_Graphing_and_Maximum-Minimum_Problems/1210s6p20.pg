TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

It takes a certain power \(P\) to keep a plane moving along at a speed
\(v\).  The power needs to overcome air drag which increases as the
speed increases, and it needs to keep the plane in the air which gets
harder as the speed decreases.  So assume the power required is given
by \[P=cv^2 + {d\over v^2}\] where \(c\) and \(d\) are positive
constants.  (They depend on your plane, your altitude, and the
weather, among other things.)  Enter here \{&ans_rule(30)\} the choice
of \(v\) that will minimize the power required to keep moving at speed
\(v\).

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose you have a certain amount of fuel and the fuel
flow required to deliver a certain  power is proportional to
to that power.  What is the speed \(v\) that will maximize your
range (i.e., the distance you can travel at that speed before your
fuel runs out)?  Enter your speed here
\{&ans_rule(30)\}

EOT

$ans="(3d/c)^(1/4)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans, limits=>[[1,100],[1,100]], vars=>["c","d"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Finally, enter here \{&ans_rule(30)\} the ratio of the speed that
maximizes the distance and the speed that minimizes the required
power.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

The first question, what's the minimal power required to stay aloft,
is simple.  We differentiate \(P\) with respect to \(v\), set the
derivative to zero and solve the equation.  This gives:
\[P'=2cv -2dv^{-3}=0,\] Multiplying with \(v^3\), rearranging, and
calling the solution \(v_0\), we obtain
\[2cv^4=2d \implies v_0 = \left(\frac{d}{ c}\right)^{1/4}.\]

Now consider maximizing the range.  The range equals speed times the
time we remain in the air.  That time is inversely proportional to the
fuel flow, which in turn is proportional to the power.  Thus our range
it proportional to the ratio of speed and Power.  Therefore, to
maximize the range we have to maximize
\[R = \frac{v}{ P} = \frac{v }{ cv^2+\frac{d}{ v^2}} = \frac{v^3 }{ cv^4 +
d}.\] Differentiating gives:
\[R' = \frac{3v^2\left(cv^4+d\right) - 4cv^3v^3 }{
\left(cv^4+d\right)^2} = 0.\]
The numerator of this derivative is zero when
\[3v^2d - cv^6 =v^2\left(3d-cv^4\right)=0.\]
This gives the optimum speed
\[v_1 = \left(\frac{3d}{ c}\right)^{1/4} = 3^{1/4}v_0 \approx 1.32
v_0. \] So to fly as $BITALIC far$EITALIC as possible requires flying about 32$PERCENT
faster than if you were flying to stay aloft as $BITALIC long$EITALIC as
possible.
