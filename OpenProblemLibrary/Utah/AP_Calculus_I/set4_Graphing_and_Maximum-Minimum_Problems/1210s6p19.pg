TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

You are going to make many cylindrical cans.  The cans will hold
different volumes.  But you'd like them all to be such that the amount
of sheet metal used for the cans is as small as possible, subject to
the can holding the specific volume.  How do you choose the ratio of
diameter to height of the can?  Assume that the thickness of the wall,
top, and bottom of the can is everywhere the same, and that you can
ignore the material needed for example to join the top to the wall.

Put differently, you ask what ratio of diameter to height will 
minimize the area of a cylinder with a given volume?



$BR
That ratio equals \{&ans_rule(30)\}.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

The volume \(V\) and the area \(A\) of those cans is given by \[V= \pi
r^2 h = \frac{\pi}{ 4} d^2 h \quad\hbox{and}\quad A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi
rh = \pi \left(\frac{d^2}{ 2} + dh\right) \] where \(r\) is the radius
of the can.  The standard way of approaching this problem would be to
use the volume formula to express \(d\) or \(h\) in terms of the
other, substitute in the area formula, differentiate the area with
respect to the remaining variable (\(h\) or \(d\), respectively), find
out where the derivative is zero, then compute the previously
eliminated variable, and finally compute the optimum ratio.  We expect
that ratio to be independent of the volume of the can.  In other
words, the optimal $BITALIC shape$EITALIC of the can should be independent of its
volume.

However, just to illustrate another possibility, let's approach the
problem more directly.  Let's give a name 
\[\alpha = \frac{d }{ h}  \]
to the quantity we want to find, and express everything directly in
terms of that quantity, \(\alpha\).

It follows that \[d = \alpha h \quad\hbox{and
thus} \quad V= \frac{\pi \alpha^2 }{ 4} h^3. \]
Hence \[h^3 = \frac{4V }{ \pi\alpha^2} \quad\hbox{and}\quad h = \left(\frac{4V }{
\pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^{-2/3}. \]
We also obtain
\[d = \alpha\left(\frac{4V}{ \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^ {-2/3} =
\left(\frac{4V}{ \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^ {1/3}. \]

Hence the area that we want to minimize is given by
\[A = \pi \left(\frac{1}{ 2} \left(\frac{4V}{ \pi}\right)^{2/3} \alpha
^{2/3} +\left(\frac{4V}{ \pi}\right)^{2/3}\alpha^{1/3}\alpha^{-2/3}\right) = \pi \left(\frac{4V}{
\pi}\right)^{2/3}\left(\frac{1}{ 2} \alpha^{2/3} +
\alpha^{-1/3}\right). \]
For this expression to be minimized, the factor containing \(\alpha\),
i.e.,
\[F(\alpha) = \frac{1}{ 2} \alpha^{2/3} +
\alpha^{-1/3} \]
must be minimized.
Differentiating and setting the derivative to zero gives
\[F'(\alpha) = \frac{1}{ 3} \alpha^{-1/3} - \frac{1}{ 3} \alpha^{-4/3} = 
\alpha^{-4/3} (\alpha -1 ) =0. \]
The best ratio \(\alpha\) is clearly some positive real number, so
the only critical point is \[{\alpha = \frac{d }{ h} = 1} \]
and so those optimal cans are as tall as they are wide.
