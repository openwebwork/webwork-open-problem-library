This problem is a very simple example of a $BITALIC differential equation$EITALIC:
an equation that relates a function to one or more of its derivatives.
You can solve this problem by doing some educated guessing. ("educated" means 
"remember what we did in the past.")

$BR Suppose \(f\) is the function that satisfies
\[f'(x) = -f^2(x) \] 
for all \(x\) in its domain, and \[f(1) = 1.\]
Then 
$BR
\(f(x) = \) \{&ans_rule(30)\}.
EOT

$ans = "1/x";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans, limits=>[[1,2]], vars=>["x"]));
