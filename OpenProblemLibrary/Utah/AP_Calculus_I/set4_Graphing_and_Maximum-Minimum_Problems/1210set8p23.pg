$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD You can solve the ellipse problem by cranking
the handle and proceeding as we did for several similar geometric
problems.  Or you can look at the results for the circle and make an
inspired guess.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let's start with the inspired guess.  If
\(a=b=r\) the ellipse turns into the circle.  The obvious solution of
the circle problem is that the square has a length of \(\sqrt{2}r\)
and its area is \(2r^2\).  So it would be surprising if the solution of
the ellipse problem wasn't a rectangle with sides \(\sqrt{2}a\) and
\(\sqrt{2}b\), and an area \(2ab\).

$BR Let's confirm this hunch by a conventional approach: Suppose the corner of the rectangle in the first quadrant has the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\).
Then the other corners are \((x,-y)\), \((-x,y)\), and \((-x,-y)\),
the lengths of the sides are \(2x\) and \(2y\), and the area is \(4xy\).
Using the equation of the ellipse, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[ y = b\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}}.\]
The area of the rectangle is
\[A= 4xy = 4xb\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}}= 4\frac{b}{a}x\sqrt{a^2-x^2}.\]
To maximize the area we can ignore the constant factor \(
4\frac{b}{a}\), and maximize instead
\[f(x) = x\sqrt{a^2-x^2}.\]
Differentiating and setting to zero, as usual, gives
\[f'(x) = \sqrt{a^2-x^2} -\frac{2x^2}{2\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = 0.\]
Canceling the factor 2, and multiplying with the square root gives
\[a^2-x^2 - x^2 = 0\]
or
\[x = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}.\]
Substituting in our formula for \(y\) gives
\[y =  b\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}} = b\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}.\]
Hence the optimum rectangles does indeed have the expected dimensions
and area.
