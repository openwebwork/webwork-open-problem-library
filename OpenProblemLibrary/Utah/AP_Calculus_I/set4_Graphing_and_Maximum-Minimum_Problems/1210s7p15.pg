I have enough pure silver to coat \( $a \) square meter of surface area.
I plan to coat a sphere and a cube.  Allowing for the possibility of all the 
silver going onto one of the solids, what dimensions should they be if the
total volume of the silvered solids is to be a maximum? $PAR
The radius of the sphere is \{ans_rule(10) \}, $PAR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Let \(r\) denote the radius of the sphere,
\(s\) the length of the cube, \(A\) the total area, and \(V\) the total
volume.
Then

\[A=4\pi r^2+6s^2\]
and
\[V= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 + s^3.\]

Obviously, the volume is maximized if we put all of our stock in the
sphere.  In that case, 
\[r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}} \approx !{$rmax:%5.4f}\hbox{~meters}\]
(and \(s=0\) meters).
$BR
To minimize the volume we eliminate one of the variables and find a
stationary point as usual.
$BR
Solving the area equation for \(s\) gives
\[s= \sqrt{\frac{A-4\pi r^2}{6}}.\] Substituting this value in the
volume equation gives
\[V= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 + \left(\frac{A-4 \pi
r^2}{6}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}.\]
Differentiating with respect to \(r\) and setting to zero gives:
\[V'=4\pi r^2 - \frac{3}{2}\times\frac{8\pi r}{6} \left(\frac{A-4 \pi
r^2}{6}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 0.\]
This simplifies to
\[2r = \sqrt{\frac{A-4 \pi
r^2}{6}}.\]
Squaring gives
\[4r^2 = \frac{A-4 \pi
r^2}{6}\]
which gives
\[r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{24+4\pi}} \approx  !{$rmin:%5.4f}\hbox{~meters.}\]
The corresponding value of \(s\) is
\[s = 2r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{6+\pi}} \approx  !{$smin:%5.4f}\hbox{~meters.}\]
