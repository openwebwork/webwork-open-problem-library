TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A University of Rochester student decided to depart from Earth after
his graduation to find work on Mars.  Before building a shuttle, he
conducted careful calculations.  A model for the velocity of the
shuttle, from liftoff at t = $t0 s until the solid rocket boosters
were jettisoned at t = $t1 s, is given by \[ v(t) = $av t^3- \{$b1/2\}
t^2 + $c t ? {$d} \] (in feet per second).  Using this model, estimate
$BR the absolute maximum value \{ANS_RULE(1,20) \}$BR and absolute
minimum value \{ANS_RULE(2,20) \} $BR of the acceleration of the
shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the boosters.
