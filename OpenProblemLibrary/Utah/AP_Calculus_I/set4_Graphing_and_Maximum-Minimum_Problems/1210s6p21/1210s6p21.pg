This is a related rates problem with a twist.
$BR
\{image("related.gif", height => 291, width => 314);\}
$BR
Suppose you have a
street light at a height \(H\).  You drop a rock vertically so that it
hits the ground at a distance \(d\) from the street light. Denote the
height of the rock by \(h\).  The shadow of the rock moves along the
ground.  Let \(s\) denote the distance of the shadow from the point
where the rock impacts the ground.  Of course, \(s\) and \(h\) are
both functions of time.  To enter your answer into WeBWorK use the
notation \(v\) to denote \(h'\): \[v=h'.\] Then the speed of the
shadow at any time while the rock is in the air is given by \(s'= \)
\{&ans_rule(20)\} (where \(s'\) is an expression depending on \(h\),
\(s\), \(H\), and \(v\) (You will find that \(d\) drops out of your
calculation.)

ANS(fun_cmp("v*s*H/h/(H-h)", limits=>[[1,10],[1,10],[30,40],[1,10]], vars=>["v","s","H","h"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Now consider the time at which the rock hits the ground.  At that time
\[h=s=0.\]  The speed of the shadow at that time is
\(s'=\) \{&ans_rule(20)\}
where your answer is an expression depending on 
 \(H\), \(v\), and \(d\).

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Use similar triangles and implicit
differentiation.  For the second part of the problem you will need to
compute a limit.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Referring to the figure and using similar
triangles we see that
\[\frac{s}{h} = \frac{d+s}{H}\]
Differentiating gives
\[\frac{s'h-h's}{h^2} = \frac{s'}{H}.\]
We solve  this equation for \(s'\):
\[\begin{array}{rclcl}
\frac{s'h-h's}{h^2} &=& \frac{s'}{H}  &|&\hbox{distribute} \\ \\
\frac{s'}{h}-\frac{h's}{h^2} &=& \frac{s'}{H} &|& -  \frac{s'}{H}
+\frac{h's}{h^2}  \\ \\
\frac{s'}{h} -\frac{s'}{H} &=& \frac{h's}{h^2} &|& \times hH \\ \\
s'H-s'h &=& \frac{h'sH}{h} &|& \div (H-h) \\ \\
s'&=& \frac{h'sH}{h(H-h)} &|& \hbox{the answer}. \\
\end{array}
\]

Consider now the impact of the rock on the ground.  At that time \(s\)
and \(h\) are both zero, and evaluating our expression for \(s'\)
gives rise to the undefined ratio \(0/0\).  So we we need to compute
\(\lim_{s\longrightarrow 0} \frac{s}{h} \).  Since \[\frac{s}{h} =
\frac{d+s}{H}\] we have \[\lim_{s\longrightarrow 0} \frac{s}{h} =
\lim_{s\longrightarrow 0} \frac{d+s}{H} = \frac{d}{H}.\]

This is a nifty application of what we have learned about limits!
