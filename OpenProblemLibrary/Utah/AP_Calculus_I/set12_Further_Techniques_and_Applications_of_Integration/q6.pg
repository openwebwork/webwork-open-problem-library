TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
I got the following data from
\{htmlLink("http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/sun.html","this
web page:")\} The diameter of the Sun is 1.392 million kilometers.
The mean distance of the Sun from the Earth (measured from center to
center) is 149 million kilometers.  The surface gravity on the Sun is
274 meters per second squared.  Using those numbers, the escape
velocity on the surface of the Sun is \{ans_rule(10)\} kilometers per
second.

$PAR
For the next part, let's first solve a general problem.  Suppose you
have a planet or star of radius \(R\) and surface gravity \(G\). Then
the escape velocity on the surface of that object is \{ans_rule(10)\}.
(We answered that question in class.).  Now suppose you are already at
a distance \(S>R\) from the center of that object.  Then the escape
velocity is only \{ans_rule(20)\}.


$PAR
Let's apply this to our actual world.  Suppose you are launching a
space craft from a point in Earth's orbit.  Ignoring earth's gravity
the minimum speed required to cause your craft to leave the solar
system is \{ans_rule(10)\} kilometers per second.


EOT
$R = 1.392E6/2;
$G = 0.274;
$S = 149E6;
$E = sqrt(2*$G*$R*$R/$S);


ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(2*$G*$R)));
ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt(2*G*R)", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["G","R"]));
ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt(2*G*R*R/S)", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["G","R","S"]));
ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(2*$G*$R*$R/$S)));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
We saw in class that the escape velocity on the surface of an object of
radius \(R\) and surface gravity \(G\) is \(\sqrt{2GR}\).
For the Sun this works out to about 618 km/sec.

To get the escape velocity at a distance \(S\) we modify the analysis
discussed in class. The work required to lift an object of mass \(m\)
from a distance \(S\) to infinity is
\[w= \int_S^\infty mG (\frac{R}{s})^2 $d s = mg\frac{R^2}{S}.\]
Equating this with the kinetic energy at launch with a speed \(v_0\)
and solving for \(v_o\) gives

\[ mG\frac{R^2}{S} = \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad
v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2GR^2}{S}}.\] 
 
On Earth this works out to about 42 kilometers per second squared.  So
leaving the solar system from where we are is quite a bit harder
harder than just leaving earth.
