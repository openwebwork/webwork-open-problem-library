TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This question summarizes a few simple facts about polynomials.  Recall that a
polynomial \(p\) can be written in the form \[p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n
\alpha_i x^i \] where we assume that \(\alpha_n\neq 0\).  The degree of
a polynomial is the largest exponent present, and so the degree of
\(p\) is \(n\).  Fill in the blanks in the following questions:

$PAR The degree of \(p'(x)\) is 
\{&ans_rule(5)\}.

$PAR The degree of \(\int p(x) \hbox{d}x \) is 
\{&ans_rule(5)\}.

$PAR The degree of \(p^2(x)\) (i.e., the square of \(p\)) is
\{&ans_rule(5)\}.

$PAR The \((n+1)\)-th derivative of \(p\) is
\{&ans_rule(5)\}.
