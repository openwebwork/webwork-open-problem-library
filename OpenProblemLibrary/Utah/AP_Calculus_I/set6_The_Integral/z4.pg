TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are testing your brand new Ferrari Testarossa.  To see how well the
brakes work you accelerate to 100 miles per hour, slam on the brakes,
and determine that you brought the car to a stop over a distance of $d
feet.  Assuming a constant deceleration you figure that that
deceleration is \{ans_rule( 25)\} feet per second squared. (Enter a
positive number.)

$PAR I trust that you don't have the courage to try this, but that
night you wonder how long it would take you to stop (with the same
constant deceleration) if you were moving at 200 miles per hour.
Your stopping distance
would be \{ans_rule( 25)\} feet.
(Enter a number, not an arithmetic
expression.)
