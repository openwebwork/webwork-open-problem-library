TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you are driving a car at 80 miles per hour.

$PAR 
Again decelerating at 16 feet per second squared
 it will take you \{ans_rule( 25)\} seconds to stop.

$PAR During that time you will travel \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet.

$PAR Assuming that it takes you 1 second to react to an emergency
before you start braking, at the same initial speed, and the same
constant deceleration, you will travel a total of \{ans_rule( 25) \}
feet, before coming to a stop.

EOT

$v = 80;
$vfs = $v*5280/3600;
$g = 16;
$tstop = $vfs/$g;
ANS(num_cmp($tstop));
ANS(num_cmp($vfs/2*$tstop));
ANS(num_cmp($vfs/2*$tstop+$vfs));
