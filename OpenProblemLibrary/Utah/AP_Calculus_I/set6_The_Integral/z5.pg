TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
According to Richard Graham in "SR-71 Revealed: The Inside Story", the
Lockheed SR-71 Reconnaissance plane accelerates from a standing start
to a speed of Mach 3 (3 times the speed of sound) "in about 14
minutes".  
$BR$BR
Assuming that the time is exactly 14 minutes, and
the speed of sound is 1100 feet per second, this is an average
acceleration of \{ans_rule( 25)\} feet per second squared.  Assuming
that the acceleration is constant, during that time your SR-71 covers a
distance of \{ans_rule( 25)\} miles.
