TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Let's practice some conversions. A speed of \(m\) miles
per hour equals a speed of \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet per second, and a
speed \(f\) feet per second equals a speed of \{ans_rule( 25) \} miles
per hour.  Recall that there are 5280 feet in a mile, and 3600 seconds
in an hour.


Recall that velocity is the derivative of distance, and acceleration
is the derivative of velocity.  Suppose that acceleration is constant,
and equal to \(A\). Suppose at time 0 your velocity is \(V\). 

$PAR Let \(v(t)\) denote your velocity at time \(t\). Then $PAR \(v(t)
= \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}.

Suppose at time \(t=0\) your distance (in whatever direction you are
moving) is D.

$PAR Let \(d(t)\) denote your distance at time \(t\).  Then $PAR
\(d(t) = \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}.

$PAR Let's translate that into a familiar context.  Suppose \(A=-32\)
feet per second squared, \(h(t)\) is you height at time \(t\), \(H\)
is your initial height, and \(V\) is your initial velocity.  Then your
height \(h(t)\) at time \(t\) is \(h(t) = \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}, your
velocity at time \(t\) is \(v(t) = h'(t) = \) \{ans_rule( 25) \}, and
your acceleration at time(t) is, of course, \(a(t) = v'(t) = h''(t) =
\)  \{ans_rule( 25) \} feet per second squared.
