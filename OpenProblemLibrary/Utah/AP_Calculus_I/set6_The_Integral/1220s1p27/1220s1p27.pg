SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

This discussion is a bit involved.  It has these ingredients:

$BR
$BR A description of expectations.
$BR A piece of messy algebra.  Don't hesitate to ask if you get
stuck somewhere.  Also note that while the final answer is indeed
simple, it is arrived at only after a great deal of simplification.
However, WeBWorK will also accept much more messy and less pretty
intermediate expressions arising on the way.
$BR A geometric argument that is much simpler but that may
not be so easy to think of.  I thought of it only after going through the 
algebra (and felt pretty deflated in hindsight).
$BR Another argument based on determinants.  You probably don't know
enough about determinants to come up with it yourself.  I thought of
it only several years after I first posed this problem.  However, it
is by far the simplest.

$BBOLD Expectations$EBOLD

Before doing the algebra it pays to think about what we expect
the result to look like.  

The distance of the point from the line is the $BBOLD shortest distance$EBOLD of
the point $BBOLD from any point on the line$EBOLD.  However, let's also consider
the distance of the point from the line in the vertical direction (and
call that the $BBOLD vertical distance$EBOLD).  Clearly the perpendicular distance
must be related to the vertical distance and the horizontal distance.


The vertical distance is 
\[d_{\hbox{vert}} = |(mp + b) -q| \]

(You can express the absolute value of something in WeBWorK by using the 
notation $BITALIC abs(), $EITALIC but to avoid that additional level of 
complexity
you may assume, as stated in the problem, that the point \(P\) lies
below the line. In that case the absolute value can simply be
omitted.)

We could compute the horizontal distance, but it is infinite if \(L\) is
horizontal, i.e., \(m\) is zero.  So we'll focus on the vertical distance.

Let's denote the perpendicular distance by \(d\).  Geometrically it
makes sense that it is proportional to the vertical distance, and the
constant of the proportion depends only on the slope of the line.
Moreover, the perpendicular distance is never larger than the vertical
distance.  So we expect our result to be of the form
\[d = g(m) d_{\hbox{vert}} \] for some function \(g\).  Moreover,
\(g(m)\) should be no larger than 1 for all \(m\), it should be equal to 1
when \(m=0\) and it should approach 0 as \(m\) approaches infinity. Below
we'll see how one can work
out \(g(m)\) just from the geometry of the
situation.

$BBOLD The Algebra$EBOLD

Having formulated our expectations we are now ready to embark on doing
the algebra.

Our first task is to find expressions for the coordinates of \(Q\).
Having those we can then compute the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\).

The line though \(P\) and perpendicular to \(L\) has the equation
\[{y - q\over x-p} = - {1 \over m}\]
This can be rewritten as
\[y = q - {1\over m}\left(x - p\right) \]
The point \(Q=\left(u,v\right)\) lies at the intersections of the the two
lines.
Thus
\[v = q - {1\over m}\left(u - p\right) = mu + b.\]
We need to solve this equation for \(u\).  
Rearranging gives
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
-{1\over m} u - m u &=& b - q - {p\over m} \\
           -\left({1\over m} + m\right) u &=& b - q - {p\over m }\\
\end{array}
\]
Thus
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
u &=&{b - q - {p\over m} \over -{1\over m} - m} \\
               &=& {-bm +mq +p \over 1 + m^2} \\ 
\end{array}\]
and
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
v &=& mu + b \\
&=&{-bm^2 + m^2q +mp + b + m^2b\over 1 + m^2} \\
&=&{ m^2q +mp + b \over 1 + m^2} \\
\end{array}
\]

We are now ready to compute \(d\).  To avoid square roots we compute
\(d^2\) instead:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
d^2 &=& \left(v-q\right)^2 + \left(u-p\right)^2 \\
&=&{\left(m^2q + mp + b - q -m^2q\right)^2 \over \left(1+m^2\right)^2}
+ {\left(-bm +mq + p -p -m^2p\right)^2\over \left(1+m^2\right)^2} \\
&=&{1 \over \left(1+m^2\right)^2}\left(\left(mp + b - q\right)^2 + m^2\left(q - mp-b\right)^2 \right) \\
&=&{\left(q - mp -b\right)^2 \over 1+m^2}\\
&=&{d^2_{\hbox{vert}} \over 1+m^2} \\ 
\end{array}\]
as expected. Taking square roots gives:
\[d= {d_{\hbox{vert}}  \over \sqrt{1+m^2}}
 \qquad(*)\]


$BBOLD The Geometry$EBOLD

As alluded to above, one can work out the formula
\((*)\)
strictly from geometric principles.  Actually, this is a lot simpler,
but one has to see it, and doing the above brute force approach,
while a bit heavy, is sure to work.


Consider  the Figure:
$BR
\{image("fig.gif", height => 411, width => 482);\}


It shows the points \(P\) and \(Q\), and the line \(L\).  Let's label
the length of the vertical side \(s\), the length of the horizontal
side \(r\), and the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) \(h\), as
indicated.  Since the two small angles in a right triangle add to 90
degrees, the angle \(QPS\) equals the \(QRP\), and the angle \(QSP\)
equals the angle \(RPQ\).  In other words, the triangles \(RQP\),
\(PQS\), and \(RPS\) are all $BITALIC similar$EITALIC, and the ratio of
corresponding lengths of sides are equal.

(Note
that \(s\) in the Figure means vertical distance whereas in the body
of the question it means the slope of the perpendicular line.)

Again, to avoid square roots and absolute values, we consider
squares of distances.
Note that 
\[m^2 = {s^2\over r^2} \]
by the definition of \(m\) (as rise divided by run).

Moreover,
by the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[{s^2\over h^2} = {r^2 + s^2 \over r^2} = 1 +{s^2 \over r^2} = 1+m^2. \]
Thus, 
\[h^2 = {s^2 \over 1+m^2} \] which is our result \((*)\)

$BBOLD The Determinant Argument$EBOLD

Consider the points \(S = (0,b)\) and \(R = (1,m+b)\) which both lie
on the line \(L\).  Asking how far \(P\) is from the line is the same
as asking for the height of the triangle with vertices \(P\), \(S\)
and \(R\), as suggested in the above Figure. (In this argument the
triangle is not a right one, but that does not matter for the
determination of the height.) Let's consider the base of that triangle
to be the side with vertices \(S\) and \(R\) which has length
\(\sqrt{1+m^2}\).  The height of the triangle is twice the area of
the triangle divided by the length of the base.  Twice the area of the
triangle is the absolute value of the determinant

\[D = \left| 
\begin{array}{ccc}
1&0&b\\1&1&m+b\\1&p&q\\
\end{array}
\right| = q-(m+b)-b(p-1) = q-mp-b.\]

This gives the desired result:

\[d=\frac{|q-mp-b|}{\sqrt{1+m^2}}.\]

(Determinants are a large subject, this application is just a tiny
piece of a huge ice-berg.)
