$BBOLD The Columbia Accident.$EBOLD
On January 16, 2003, 81.7 seconds into the ascent, a piece of foam,
weighing about 1.7 pounds, and being roughly the size, shape and weight of
a large loaf of bread, separated from the bipod ramp of the space
shuttle Columbia's external fuel tank and impacted the leading edge of
the shuttle's left wing.  At that time the shuttle was traveling at
approximately 1,568 mph (Mach 2.46) and was at an altitude of 66,000
feet. Based on film evidence, the foam traveled the 58-foot distance
from the ramp to the wing in 0.16 seconds. Assuming a constant
acceleration relative to the body of 
the space shuttle of \{ans_rule(20)\} feet per second

or \{ans_rule(20)\} miles per hour.
Unbeknownst to the astronauts and observers on earth, it struck the
wing hard enough to cause the destruction of the Columbia two weeks
later during re-entry on February 1, 2003.

A much more involved calculation estimated the speed of the impact
to be about 530 mph.  You can find very detailed information about all
aspects of the Columbia accident in this

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Figure everything relative to the moving space
shuttle, i.e., the origin is traveling with the shuttle.  Acceleration
is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the derivative of
displacement.  In this case, the acceleration is constant (by
assumption), and the initial velocity and displacement are 0.  After
0.16 seconds the displacement is 58 feet.  There are 3,600 seconds in
an hour, and 5280 feet in a mile.  As in many real problems, the
problem statement contains extraneous information.  You have to decide
what parts of the information are pertinent.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Velocity \(v\) is the derivative of
displacement \(d\), and acceleration \(a\) is the derivative of
velocity.  If the acceleration is constant (and the initial velocity
and displacement are 0), then \[v=at\] and \[s=\frac{1}{2} a t^2.\]
Substituting \(s=58\) and \(t=1.6\) in the last equation allows us to
solve for \[a = \frac{2s}{t} = \frac{2\times 58 }{0.16^2}\approx
4531\hbox{ft/sec}^2.\] (This is more than 140 times the acceleration
caused by gravity.  The space shuttle itself was accelerating at only about
40 feet per second squared.  The large acceleration of that bulky and
light weight foam was caused by the slip stream, despite the thin air
at 66,000 feet.)  Multiplying that acceleration with the time of
\(t=0.16\) seconds gives an impact velocity of 725 feet per second.
Dividing by 5280 (feet per mile) and multiplying by 3,600 (seconds per
hour) gives a speed of 494.3 miles per hour.  That's remarkably close
to the "official" estimate of 530 mph.  Calculus is amazing!



$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD The solution of this exercise is referred to as 
$BITALIC  a simple calculation $EITALIC in
\{htmlLink("http://www.swri.edu/3pubs/ttoday/fall03/LeadingEdge.htm",
"this article")\}.  The lead scientist in this part of the accident
investigation was James Walker who in 1988 received his Ph.D. from our
department.  The idea of this exercise was stimulated by a talk about
the accident that Walker gave here in the Fall of 2004.
