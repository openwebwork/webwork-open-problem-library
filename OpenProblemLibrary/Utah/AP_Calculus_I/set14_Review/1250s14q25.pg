$BBOLD Improper Integrals, Infinite Limits of Integration:$EBOLD
Integrals may have infinite limits of integration, or integrands that
have singularities.  Such integrals are called "improper" even
though there is nothing wrong with such integrals.  They may have well
defined values, in which case we say they converge, or they may not, in
which case we say they diverge.  In this and the next problem, give
the value of the integral if it converges, and enter the letter "D"
if it diverges.
