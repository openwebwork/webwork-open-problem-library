$BBOLD Exponential Growth and Decay:$EBOLD  Here are a couple of examples for
applications of exponentials and logarithms.

$PAR You find out that in the year 1800 an ancestor of yours invested
100 dollars at 6 percent annual interest, compounded yearly.  You
happen to be her sole known descendant and in the year 2005 you
collect the accumulated tidy sum of \{ans_rule(20)\} dollars.  You
retire and devote the next 10 years of your life to writing a detailed
biography of your remarkable ancestor.

$PAR
Strontium-90 is a biologically important radioactive isotope that is
created in nuclear explosions.  It has a half life of 28 years.  To
reduce the amount created in a particular explosion by a factor 1,000
you would have to wait \{ans_rule(20)\} years. Round your answer to
the nearest integer.


$PAR
Seeds found in a grave in Egypt proved to have only $a$PERCENT of the
Carbon-14 of living tissue.  Those seeds were harvested
\{ans_rule(20)\} years ago.  The half life of Carbon-14 is 5,730
years.
