$BBOLD Differential Equations:$EBOLD  A differential equation is
an equation that involves and unknown function and some of its
derivatives.  Differential Equations are a large subject on which we
teach several courses.  In Calculus you only get a first exposure to
them and you see some very simple examples.  Set up and solve a
differential equation to solve the following problem:

$PAR You have a pond with decorative fish in your back yard.  The pond
holds 800 gallons of water.  Once a week you pour fresh water into the
pond at the rate of 100 gallons per hour.  The pond is filled to the
brim, and so as you pour water into the tank water flows out at the
same rate.  There is a pump in the pond that keeps the water perfectly
mixed.  Your goal is to add water until any pollutants in the pond are
reduced by a factor 1/2.  You keep the fresh water flowing for
\{ans_rule(20)\} hours. (Remember that ww expects your answer to be
accurate within one tenth of one percent.  You may want to enter a
mathematical expression rather than a numerical value.)
