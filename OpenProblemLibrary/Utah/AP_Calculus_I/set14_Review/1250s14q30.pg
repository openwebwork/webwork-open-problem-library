$BBOLD Series:$EBOLD  A Series (Or $BITALIC Infinite Series$EITALIC) is
obtained from a sequence by adding the terms of the sequence.  Another
sequence associated with the series is the sequence of $BITALIC partial
sums. $EITALIC  A series converges if its sequence of partial sums 
converges.
The sum of the series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums.

$BR For example, consider the geometric series defined by the sequence
\[a_n= \frac{1}{r^n}, \quad n=0,1,2, \ldots\] Then the \(n\)-th
partial sum \(S_n\) is given by $BR \(\displaystyle S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n
\frac{1}{r^k} = \)
 \{ans_rule(20)\} and, for \(|r| > 1\), 
$BR 
\(\displaystyle
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{r^k} = \lim_{n\longrightarrow\infty} S_n =
\) \{ans_rule(20)\}.


$BR
Thus
$BR \(\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^k = \)
 \{ans_rule(20)\} and
$BR \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^k = \)
 \{ans_rule(20)\}.

$BR Another situation in which we we can actually compute the partial
sums occurs if those sums are $BITALIC collapsing$EITALIC. It may not be obvious
that that is the case, but look for it in this example:
$BR
\( \sum_{k=0}^n \left(\frac{1}{k^2+9k+20}\right)\) = 
 \{ans_rule(20)\} and thus
$BR
\( \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{k^2+9k+20}\right)\) = 
 \{ans_rule(20)\}.
