TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Applying your knowledge of Inverse
Functions.  A ball is thrown vertically upward from the ground with
velocity \(s\).  Find the maximum height \(H\) of the ball as a
function of \(s\).  Then find the velocity \(s\) required to achieve a
height of \(H\).   As
usual, ignore air resistance, and assume that gravity causes a
downward acceleration of 32 feet per second squared.

$BR
\( H \) =  \{ ans_rule(40) \}.

ANS(fun_cmp("(s**2)/64", limits=>[3,5], vars=>["s"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

\( s \) =  \{ ans_rule(40) \}.

ANS(fun_cmp("8*H^.5", limits=>[3,5], vars=>["H"]));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The velocity of the ball is \(v(t)\) a function of
time, \(t\).  It is given by  \( v(t) = s - 32t \).  Integrate to get a function
describing the height of the ball as a function of time.This also
determines the height of the ball as a function of s.  Use techniques
you remember from Calculus I to maximize this function.  For the
second part, let H be some given height and set this equal to \( H(s)
\).  Then use techniques of this chapter to find a value of s which
achieves the height H.  Remember that Mathematics and WeBWorK are case
sensitive.  So you need to use an upper case H and a lower case s.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Follow the hint.  Start with \( v = s - 32t
\).  Integrate to get\( H(t) = -16t^2 + st \).  Since the ball is
thrown from the ground we see the integration constant is \(0\).  Write
this as a function of \(s\), \( H(s) = -16t^2 + st \).  Set \( v = 0 \) to
maximize \( H(s) \) and see that \( t = \frac{s}{32} \) and plug this
into \( H(s) \).  This gives \( H(s) = \frac{s^2}{64} \).  For the
second part, set \( H = \frac{s^2}{64} \) and solve for \(s\).
