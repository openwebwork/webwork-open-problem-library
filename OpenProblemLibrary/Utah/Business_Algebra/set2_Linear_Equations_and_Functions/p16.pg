TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

You want to build a rectangular fence which is $x feet longer than it is wide.  You want the area enclosed by the fence to be $i square feet.  How wide is the fence (we are asking for the smaller side length)?

$BR

Answer:  \{ans_rule(30)\}

EOT

$ans1 = (-$x+sqrt($x*$x+4*$i))/2;
ANS(num_cmp($ans1));
