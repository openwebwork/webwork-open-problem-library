Suppose a professor counts the final exam as being equal 
to each of the other tests in her course, and she will also change
the lowest test score to match the final exam score if 
the final exam score is higher. If a student's four test scores
are 83, 67, 52, and 90, what is the lowest score the 
student can earn on the final exam and still obtain at least
an 80 average for the course ?

$BR
Answer:  \{ ans_rule(30) \}

$ans1 = 80 ;
ANS(num_cmp($ans1));
