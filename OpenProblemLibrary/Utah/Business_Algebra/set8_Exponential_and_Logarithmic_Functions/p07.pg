Suppose in the year 2004 you invested $DOLLAR 1000.- at an interest rate
\(p\) which is such that your capital doubles every 6 years (interest is compounded annually).
That interest rate is 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} percent.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As we have discussed before, the annual interest rate \(p\) is
\[p = \left(2^{1/6}-1\right)\times 100 \approx 12.25 \hbox{\char37}.\]
$BR
Every year we multiply with a factor \(2^{1/6}\).  In any 2 year
period we multiply with a factor 2, in any twelve year period we
multiply with 4, etc., and in general in any \(t\) year period we
multiply with \(2^{t/6}\).  After 50 years we
have \[1000\times 2^{50/6} = \hbox{$DOLLAR}322,539.79.\]
(Of course, that's quite an interest rate!)
