Human hair from a grave in Africa proved to have only $a$PERCENT of
the carbon 14 of living tissue.  When was the body buried?  The half
life of carbon 14 is 5730 years.

$PAR

The body was buried about \{ans_rule(40)\} years ago.

$ans = ln($a/100)/$k;
$ANS = int($ans+0.5);

#ANS(num_cmp($ans, tolType=>"absolute", tol=>$absTol));

First find \(r\), then find \(t\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Find
\( r\) by setting \(.5P_{0} = P_{0}e^{r5730} \), since 5730 is the
half-life.  Solve this for \(r\) and use this and the given $a$PERCENT to
set up \(.$A P_{0} = P_{0}e^{rt}\) and solve for \( t \) to find that
\( t \) = $ANS.
