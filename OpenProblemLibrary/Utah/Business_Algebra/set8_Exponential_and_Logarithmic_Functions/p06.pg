The key aspect of exponential growth:

$BR

$BBOLD In any time interval of a given length, the function value is 
multiplied by the same factor. $EBOLD

$BR

You invest money a at certain annual interest rate \(p\).  Interest is
paid once a year.  It is customary to use instead of the percentage the rate 
\(r\) defined by 
\[r = \frac{p}{100}.\]
$BR

$BR Every year you multiply your current capital by a factor
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} (where your answer of course  depends on \(r\)).
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("1+r", limits=>[[1,2]], vars=>["r"]));



TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR In \(2\) years you multiply your initial capital with 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(1+r)**2", limits=>[[1,2]], vars=>["r"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR In \(3\) years you multiply your initial capital with 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(1+r)**3", limits=>[[1,2]], vars=>["r"]));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR In \(t\) years you multiply your initial capital with 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} (where your answer depends on \(r\) and \(t\)).
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(1+r)**t", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["r","t"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR Supposing that your initial deposit is \(I\), after
\(t\) years, your balance is
$BR
\(f(t)\) =
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} (where your answer depends on \(r\), \(t\), and 
\(I\)).
(Remember that variables are case sensitive, you do need to use the proper upper or lower case for each variable.)
$BR
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(1+r)**t*I", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["r","t","I"]));





SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As we discussed in class, in \(t\) years you multiply 
your initial capital with \((1+r)^t\) so that if \(I\) is  your initial investment, 
after \(t\) years it has grown to
\[f(t) = (1+r)^tI.\]
