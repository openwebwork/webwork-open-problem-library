TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

You are investing money at $p percent annual interest, compounded
continuously. It will take you 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} years to double your investment.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD As discussed in class (and in section 3.1 of
the textbook), if money is invested at \(p\) percent and compounded
continuously, then the factor \(p(t)\) multiplying the initial
investment after \(t\) years is given by \[p(t) = e^{rt}
\quad\hbox{where}\quad r = \frac{p}{100}.\] To find the time at which
the initial investment is doubled we solve the equation \[e^{rt}=2.\]
Taking the natural logarithm on both sides and dividing by \(r\)
yields \[t = \frac{\ln 2} {r}\] which with our value of \(p = $p\)
percent gives a value of \[t \approx $dr \hbox{years}.\]
