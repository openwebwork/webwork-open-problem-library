$BR The lessons we learned about shifting graphs apply to exponential functions just as they apply to any other functions.

The figure above shows the graphs of five exponential functions,
listed below.  Match the functions with the colors, using b for blue,
r for red, g for green, p for purple, and y for yellow.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The red graph shows \(f(0) = 1\) and \(f(1) = 2\), so it is the graph
of \(f(x) = 2^x\).  The green graph approaches \(1\) as \(x\) becomes
more negative and so it must be the graph of \(f(x) = 2^x + 1\).
Similarly, the yellow graph approaches \(-1\), so it is the graph of
\(f(x)=2^x-1.\).  The purple graph has \(f(0) = 2\), it is the graph
of \(f(x) = 2^{x+1}\), and the blue graph has \(f(0) = \frac{1}{2} =
2^{-1}\), so it is the graph of \(f(x) = 2^{x-1}\).
