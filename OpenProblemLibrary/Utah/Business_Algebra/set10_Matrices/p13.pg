Brooke is buying a new sailing boat. She can afford  $DOLLAR$S  monthly
payments. If the store charges \( $r% \) interest rate, compounded monthly, and
Brooke wants to pay off her loan in \( $t \) years, what is the most expensive
boat she can buy?

Boat price =  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(30)\} 
        
EOT

$ans = $S*(1-(1+$r/1200)**(-12*$t))/($r/1200);
