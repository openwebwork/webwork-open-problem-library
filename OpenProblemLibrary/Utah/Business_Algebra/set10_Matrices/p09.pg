The Math department purchased a copy machine for  $DOLLAR 12000. After \( $t \) years,
the machine will be worthless. How much money should the department deposit at 
the end of each quarter, if the money is worth \( $r% \) compounded quarterly, 
in order to save enough to buy a new copy machine at the end of \( $t \) years?

$ans = 12000/((1+$r/400)**(4*$t)-1)*($r/400);
