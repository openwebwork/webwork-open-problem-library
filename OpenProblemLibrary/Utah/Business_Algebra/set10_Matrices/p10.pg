The Math department also purchased a printer. After \( $t \) years, it
will have a salvage value of  $DOLLAR$S. A new printer is
expected to cost  $DOLLAR$P. The department established a sinking
fund in order to provide money for the difference between the cost and
the salvage value. If the fund earns \( $r% \) compounded
semiannually, determine the size of payments.
