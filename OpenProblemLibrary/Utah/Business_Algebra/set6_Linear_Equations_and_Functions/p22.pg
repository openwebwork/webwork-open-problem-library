A new apartment building was sold for $DOLLAR$a $n years after it was purchased.
The original owners calculated that the building appreciated $DOLLAR$b per year
while they owned it. Find a linear function that describes the appreciation of
the building, if \( x \) is a number of years since the original purchase.
 
\( f(x)= \) \{ans_rule(30)\}
