Dan has a choice of investing a sum of money at \( $r% \) compounded monthly or
at \( $p% \) compounded daily. 
Calculate the effective rate in each case to
determine the better rate.
$BR
\( $r% \) compounded monthly is equivalent to 
\( r_{e}\) of \{ans_rule(30)\} \( % \)
$BR
\( $p% \) compounded daily is equivalent to 
\( r_{e} \) of \{ans_rule(30)\} \( % \)
        
EOT

$ans1 = ((1+$r/1200)**12-1)*100;
$ans2 = ((1+$p/36500)**365-1)*100;

ANS(num_cmp($ans1));
ANS(num_cmp($ans2));
