TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));



A manufacturer has $co1 units in stock. The product is now selling
at $DOLLAR$p per unit. Next month the unit price will increase by ${DOLLAR}0.50. The manufacturer wants the total revenue received from the sale of the $co1 
units to be no less than $DOLLAR$co2. What is the number of 
units that can be sold this month?



$BR



Answer:  At most \{ans_rule(30)\} units



EOT



$ans1 = 100*$n;

ANS(num_cmp($ans1));
