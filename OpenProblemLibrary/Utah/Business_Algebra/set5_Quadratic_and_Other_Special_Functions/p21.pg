Recall our discussion of symmetry in class.  The graph of an equation
is symmetric with respect to the \(x\)-axis if \((x,-y)\) is on the graph whenever 
\((x,y)\) is.  It is symmetric with respect to the \(y\) axis if
\((-x,y)\) is on the graph  whenever \((x,y)\) is.  And it's symmetric with the 
respect to the origin if \((-x,-y)\) is on the graph whenever \((x,y)\) is.

$BR

For example, the graph of \(y=x^2\) is symmetric with respect to the
\(y\) axis since if we replace \(x\) with \(-x\) we obtain the same
\(y\).  Similarly, the graph of \(x=y^2\) is symmetric with respect to
the \(x\)-axis.  The graph of \(y = x^3\) is symmetric with respect to
the origin because we get \(-y\) when we replace \(x\) with \(-x\).
On the other hand, the equation \(y = x+1\) is not symmetric in any of
these three senses.


$BR
Below, enter x if the graph of the given equation is symmetric with respect to the \(x\)-axis, \(y\) if it is symmetric with respect to the \(y\) axis,
o (lower case O) if it is symmetric with respect to the origin, and
n (for None) if it has none of these three symmetries.
