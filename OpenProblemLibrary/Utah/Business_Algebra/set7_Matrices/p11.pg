A toy rocket is launched straight up from the roof of a garage with an initial
velocity of $a feet per second. The height \( h \) of the rocket in feet, 
at \( t
\) seconds after it was launched, is described by \( h(t)=-16 t^2+$a t +$b 
\).
Find the maximum height of the rocket. 

\( h= \) \{ans_rule(10)\} feet
