TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

Assume a rock is dropped down a well, but you are on a planet with a
gravity constant \(g\) (instead of 32 feet per second squared) and a
speed of sound \(c\) (instead of 1100 feet per second), and that you
hear the impact of the rock after \(t\) seconds.  Then the depth of
the well is $BR \{ ans_rule(30) \} $BR feet, where your answer depends
on \(c\), \(g\), and \(t\).
$BR$BR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Thus you will have a formula that you
can use to determine the depth of a well on any planet and in any
atmosphere.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Clearly,
\[t = t_d+t_s \]
where \(t_d\) is the time that the rock takes to reach the bottom, and
\(t_s\) is the time the sound of the impact takes to travel back to your ear. 
The latter is easy to determine,:
\[t_s = \frac{d}{c}.\]
The 
equation governing the flight of the rock
is
\[h(t)  =-\frac{g}{2}t^2  + v_0 t + h_0.\]

In our case the original height and velocity are zero, and instead of height we are interested in depth, which is the negative of height.
Hence, 
when the rock reaches the bottom of the well we have that 
\[h(t) = -\frac{g}{2}t_d^2 = -d.\]
Thus
\[t_d=\sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}}.\]
We have to solve the equation
\[t_s+t_d = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} + \frac{d}{c} = t\]
for \(d\).
The key step is to recognize that 
this is a  quadratic equation, not in \(d\) but in 
the square root of \(d\).  Let's call it \(u\):
\[u = \sqrt{d}\]

Then the equation turns into:
\[t-\sqrt{\frac{2}{ g}} u - \frac{u^2}{ c} = 0.\]
We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula. You may be
comfortable doing that, and while I think that you are wasting your
energy burdening your mind with arcane information like the quadratic
formula, for the purposes of this assignment that's just fine. As for
myself, I can never remember that formula, and memorizing formulas is
error prone anyway. What if I misremember or misapply a formula? So in
this discussion, we complete the square.  We obtain after multiplying with \(-c\) and
rearranging:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{  g} } cu - ct &=& 0 \\
u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{ g} }cu +  \frac{c^2}{ 2g} &=&  \frac{c^2}{ 2g}  + ct  \\
\left(u + \frac{1 }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \right)^2 &=&
 ct + \frac{c^2 }{ 2g}
\end{array}
\]
and therefore:
\[u = - \frac{1  }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \pm \sqrt{
  ct + \frac{c^2}{ 2g}}.\]
We know that if \(t\) is 0 then \(d\), and therefore \(u\), must be 0 also.
To get \(u=0\) we must choose the positive sign.  The
solution with the negative sign is an artifact of solving a quadratic
equation.  We also
need to square on both sides of this equation to get \(d\).  After a
slight rearrangement we obtain:

\[d = u^2 = \left( - \frac{ c }{  \sqrt{2g}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 }{ 2 g}  + ct} \right)^2.\]


This is the desired formula.
