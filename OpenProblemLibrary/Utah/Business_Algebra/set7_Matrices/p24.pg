TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

Suppose you release an object and let it fall.  After \(t\) seconds it 
reaches a depth of \[d= -\frac{gt^2}{2} \hbox{~feet}\] where on earth 
\(g=32\) feet per second squared.  In other words, the speed of the 
falling object increases by 32 feet per second every second.

$BR

Sound travels through the air at a constant speed 1100 feet per second. 

$BR

Here is the problem: You drop a rock into a deep well.  You can't see
the rock's impact at the bottom, but you hear it after $t seconds.
The depth of the well is \{ ans_rule(10) \} feet.

$BR

The time that passes after you drop the rock has two components: the time it 
takes the rock to reach the bottom of the well, and the time that it
takes the sound of the impact to travel back to you.

$ans = (-137.5+sqrt(18906.25+1100*$t))**2;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's do a little more than the problem requires and compute the depth
\(d\) of the well as a function of the time \(t\) at which we hear the
impact. Let's also denote the speed of sound by \(c\) and gravity by
\(g\).  Clearly, \[t = t_d+t_s \] where \(t_d\) is the time that the
rock takes to reach the bottom, and \(t_s\) is the time the sound of
the impact takes to travel back to your ear.  The latter is easy to
determine,: \[t_s = \frac{d}{c}.\] The equation governing the flight
of the rock is \[h(t) =-\frac{g}{2}t^2 + v_0 t + h_0.\]

In our case the original height and velocity are zero, and instead of
height we are interested in depth, which is the negative of height.
Hence, when the rock reaches the bottom of the well we have that
\[h(t) = -\frac{g}{2}t_d^2 = -d.\] Thus \[t_d=\sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}}.\]
We have to solve the equation \[t_s+t_d = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} +
\frac{d}{c} = t\] for \(d\).  The key step is to recognize that this
is a quadratic equation, not in \(d\) but in the square root of \(d\).
Let's call it \(u\): \[u = \sqrt{d}\]

Then the equation turns into: \[t-\sqrt{\frac{2}{ g}} u - \frac{u^2}{
c} = 0.\] We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula. You
may be comfortable doing that, and while I think that you are wasting
your energy burdening your mind with arcane information like the
quadratic formula, for the purposes of this assignment that's just
fine. As for myself, I can never remember that formula, and memorizing
formulas is error prone anyway. What if I misremember or misapply a
formula? So in this discussion, we complete the square.  We obtain
after multiplying with \(-c\) and rearranging:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{  g} } cu - ct &=& 0 \\
u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{ g} }cu +  \frac{c^2}{ 2g} &=&  \frac{c^2}{ 2g}  + ct  \\
\left(u + \frac{1 }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \right)^2 &=&
 ct + \frac{c^2 }{ 2g}
\end{array}
\]
and therefore: \[u = - \frac{1 }{ \sqrt{2g}}c \pm \sqrt{
  ct + \frac{c^2}{ 2g}}.\] We know that if \(t\) is 0 then \(d\), and
therefore \(u\), must be 0 also.  To get \(u=0\) we must choose the
positive sign.  The solution with the negative sign is an artifact of
solving a quadratic equation.  We also need to square on both sides of
this equation to get \(d\).  After a slight rearrangement we obtain:

\[d = u^2 = \left( - \frac{ c }{  \sqrt{2g}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 }{ 2 g}  + ct} \right)^2.\]


This is the desired formula.

Plugging in
\[c=1100,\qquad g=32,\qquad t=$t\]
gives the required answer: the depth is $depth feet.
