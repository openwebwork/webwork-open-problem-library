$BR Hint: The point of intersection satisfies both equations.
Equate the right sides and solve for \(x\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD To obtain the \(x\) coordinate of the point
of intersection we solve the equation \(\frac{x}{2} + 1 = -2x+6\)
which gives \(x = 2\). To obtain the \(y\)-coordinate we
substitute that value of \(x\) in either equation and obtain \(y =
2\) also.  To check our answer we substitute in the other
equation to get the same value (and draw a picture as well).
