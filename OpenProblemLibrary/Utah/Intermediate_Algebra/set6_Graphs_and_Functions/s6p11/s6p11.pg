The next few questions will reinforce your mastery of the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/coord",
"Cartesian Coordinate System")\} and of
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight",
"equations of straight lines")\}.

The
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/coord/index.html#distance",
"distance between two points")\} is obtained by the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/pyth/", "Pythagorean
Theorem.")\} The distance of a point \(P\) from a line \(L\) is the
shortest distance between that point and a point on the line.
Geometrically, you can obtain it by drawing a line through \(P\)
perpendicularly to \(L\).  It will intersect \(L\) in a point \(Q\)
which is the point on \(L\) closest to \(P\).  Once you have \(Q\) you
simply compute the distance \(h\) between \(P\) and \(Q\).
These concepts are illustrated in this Figure:

$BR
\{image("figLean.gif", height => 360, width => 475);\}




$BR We will build slowly to a general formula for the distance of \(P\) from \(L\).
Let's start with the line \(L\) defined by \[y=\frac{1}{2}x+1.\]
The slope of \(L\) is
$BR 
\(y = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}. 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
A line that's perpendicular to \(L\) has the slope
 \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-2));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
The slopes of two lines are negative reciprocals of each other.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The original line has a slope of \(\frac{1}{2}\),
and a line that's perpendicular has a slope of \(-2\).
