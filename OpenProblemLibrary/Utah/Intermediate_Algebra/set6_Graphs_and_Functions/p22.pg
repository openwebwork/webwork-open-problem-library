TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Your friend has  a cube of gold.  
You have a cube of gold that  weighs twice as much.  Your
cube is \{ ans_rule(10) \} as long as your friends,
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2**(1/3)));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and it has \{ ans_rule(10) \} times the surface area. You can imagine
how this would work with a spherical diamond, so we won't repeat that
part here.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2**(2/3)));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Here is another question:
The ratio of the weight of your cube and the surface area of your cube is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} times as large as the corresponding ratio of your friend's cube.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2**(1/3)));
