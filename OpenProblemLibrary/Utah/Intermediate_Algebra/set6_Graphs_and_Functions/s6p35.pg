TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In the following three problems enter your answers with at least
four digits.
$BR
You propose to build a space ship that allows the entire population 
of the United States (280 million) to leave the earth.  Your plans 
allocate an average space of \(1,000 ~~(=10\times 10 \times 10)\) cubic
feet to each person.  Your space ship is going to have the shape of 
a sphere.  The radius of your space ship is 
  \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet.

EOT
$V=2.8E11;
$pi=3.141592654;
ANS(num_cmp(($V/(4/3*$pi))**(1/3)));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
The volume of  a sphere of radius 
\(r\) equals \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
280 million people requiring one thousand cubic feet each occupy
a volume of 280 billion cubic feet.   Therefore we have to solve the
equation
\[ \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 280,000,000,000 \]
which has the solution
\[r=\left(\frac{280,000,000,000 \times 3}{4\pi}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\approx 4,058.4 \hbox{~feet}.\]
