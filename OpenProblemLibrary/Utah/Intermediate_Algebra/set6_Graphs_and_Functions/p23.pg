TEXT(beginproblem());


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The effects of scaling, explored in the previous two problems for
cubes and spheres, also apply to odd shaped objects.  Just think of
them as composed of many small cubes and ask what happens to the cubes
as you change their lengths.

In the novel $BITALIC Gulliver's travels $EITALIC by Jonathan Swift, 
Gulliver
visits a country, $BITALIC Brobdingnag $EITALIC , in which everything, 
including
people, plants, buildings, etc., is 12 times as large as in England.
(In that same novel Gulliver visits several other strange countries,
and in a conversation with the King of Brobdingnag casually refers to
the future United States as "our plantations in America".)  Suppose
Gulliver encounters a giant who is shaped exactly like Gulliver,
except he is twelve times as tall.  Then the weight of that giant is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of Gulliver.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(12**3));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The area of the cross section of one of the giant's bones is 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of Gulliver's corresponding bone.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(12**2));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Hence the ratio of the giant's weight and the area of his bone's
cross section is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of Gulliver's corresponding ratio.  What
do you think would happen to the giant?  (Unfortunately WeBWorK is
not sophisticated enough to have you answer this question here, but
send me an e-mail!)
$BR 
The scaling laws explored in the last three problems explain many things, 
for example: a spider can fall out of an airplane and not get hurt, there are
no flying birds that weigh more than a person, dragons are a phantasy,
an elephant can't jump off a table without breaking bones, there have
never been animals larger than a blue whale,  children get cold more
easily than adults, potatoes get soft faster when cut into pieces
before boiling, etc.   It's all due to the same principle: scaling
lengths by a certain factor multiplies areas by the square of that
factor, and volumes by the third power of that factor.
