TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
After due consideration Congress decides to support your spaceship
plans provided you provide a cabin with a skylight for each of the
280,000,000 passengers.  You figure that on average each passenger
must have 100 square feet on the surface of your space ship.
The radius of your new and improved space ship is 
  \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet.  $PAR
EOT
$S=2.8E10;
$pi=3.141592654;
ANS(num_cmp(($S/4/$pi)**(1/2)));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
The surface  of  a sphere of radius 
\(r\) equals \(4\pi r^2\).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We need a total surface of 100 times 280 million  square feet, and so
have to solve the equation
\[28,000,000,000 = 4\pi r^2.\]
The solution of this equation is 
\[r=\sqrt{\frac{28,000,000,000}{4\pi}} \approx 47203.5 \hbox{~feet}.\]
