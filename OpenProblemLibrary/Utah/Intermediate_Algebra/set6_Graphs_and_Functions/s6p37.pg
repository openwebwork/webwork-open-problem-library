You tell Congress that the space ship they ask for would have a radius
that's   \{ ans_rule(15) \} times bigger than what you suggested

and the volume (and weight and cost) would be  \{ ans_rule(15) \} as large.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
After some discussion you decide to build a space ship for just
yourself and leave earth to explore the universe.

$BR Hint:  Use the results from the preceding two questions.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

Dividing the larger of the two radii by the smaller gives the factors
11.63.  When multiplying the radius of a sphere with a certain factor
the volume is multiplied by the cube of that factor.  Thus the volume
of the spaceship increases by a factor 1,537.
