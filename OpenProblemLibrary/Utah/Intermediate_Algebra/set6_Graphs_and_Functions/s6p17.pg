TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:  This is like the preceding two problems combined.
You will need to do quite a few calculations.  To help you check as
you go along I recommend you draw a picture and keep checking your
algebra against the picture.  You could also do the next problem first
and then simply use the formula you obtain there. (However, the
purpose of including this problem is to help you gear up for the next one.)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
The given line has slope \(-2\).  Any perpendicular line has slope
\(\frac{1}{2}\).  We being by computing the equation \(y = \frac{x}{2}
+ b \) of the line with
that slope through \((-3,4)\).  To obtain \(b\) we solve
\(4 = -\frac{3}{2} + b \) which implies that 
\(b= \frac{11}{2}\).  Next we compute the intersection of the two
lines by solving
\(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{11}{2} = -2x + 2\) which gives
\(x=-\frac{7}{5}.\).  The corresponding \(y\) value is 
\(y = \frac{24}{5}.\).  Now we need to compute the distance \(d\)
between the points \((-3,4)\) and
\(\left(-\frac{7}{5},\frac{24}{5}\right)\) which gives
\[d = \sqrt{\left(1+\frac{7}{5}\right)^2 +
\left(2-\frac{24}{5}\right)^2}\]
This last expression works out to be
\(\frac{4}{\sqrt{5}}\), but you can enter it numerically or as
a more complicated arithmetic expression.
