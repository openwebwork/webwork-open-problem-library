This question is the capstone of the previous few problems.
In the last question you had to do quite a few calculations.
If you were to compute frequently the distance of a point from a line
it would be handy to have a formula into which you plug the
coordinates of the point and the equation of the line.  At the end of
this problem you will obtain such a formula.  To help you along you
can use WeBWorK to check your intermediate answers. 

$BR
Let \(P\) be the point \( (p,q) \)  and \(L\) the line \(y = m x +
b\). 
It is not necessary, but if you like you may assume that 
\(P\) lies below the line \(L\).  All your answers below should be
algebraic expressions in terms of  \(m\), \(b\), \(p\) and \(q\).
The slope  of \(L\) is \{ans_rule(40)\}.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

This discussion is a bit involved.  It has these ingredients:

$BR
$BR A description of expectations.
$BR A piece of algebra that is messy but entirely an application of
what we have learned in this class.  Don't hesitate to ask if you get
stuck somewhere.  Also note that while the final answer is indeed
simple, it is arrived at only after a great deal of simplification.
However, WeBWorK will also accept much more messy and less pretty
intermediate expressions arising on the way.
$BR A geometric argument that is much simpler but that 
is not so easy to think of if you are focused on what we are doing in this class.

$BBOLD Expectations$EBOLD

Before doing the algebra it pays to think about what we expect
the result to look like.  

The distance of the point from the line is the $BBOLD shortest distance$EBOLD of
the point $BBOLD from any point on the line$EBOLD.  However, let's also consider
the distance of the point from the line in the vertical direction (and
call that the $BBOLD vertical distance$EBOLD).  Clearly the perpendicular distance
must be related to the vertical distance and the horizontal distance.


The vertical distance is 
\[d_{\hbox{vert}} = |(mp + b)-q| \]

(The absolute value is a little tricky to handle in WeBWorK.  That's why
you may assume, as stated in the problem, that the point \(P\) lies
below the line, in which case the absolute value can simply be
omitted. )

We could compute the horizontal distance, but it is infinite if \(L\) is
horizontal, i.e., \(m\) is zero.  So we'll focus on the vertical distance.

Let's denote the perpendicular distance by \(d\).  Geometrically it
makes sense that it is proportional to the vertical distance, and the
constant of the proportion depends only on the slope of the line.
Moreover, the perpendicular distance is never larger than the vertical
distance.  So we expect our result to be of the form
\[d = g(m) d_{\hbox{vert}} \] for some function \(g\).  Moreover,
\(g(m)\) should be no larger than 1 for all \(m\), it should be equal to 1
when \(m=0\) and it should approach 0 as \(m\) approaches infinity. Below
we'll see how one can work
out \(g(m)\) just from the geometry of the
situation.

$BBOLD The Algebra$EBOLD

Having formulated our expectations we are now ready to embark on doing
the algebra.

Our first task is to find expressions for the coordinates of \(Q\).
Having those we can then compute the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\).

The line though \(P\) and perpendicular to \(L\) has the equation
\[{y - q\over x-p} = - {1 \over m}\]
This can be rewritten as
\[y = q - {1\over m}\left(x - p\right) \]
The point \(Q=\left(u,v\right)\) lies at the intersections of the the two
lines.
Thus
\[v = q - {1\over m}\left(u - p\right) = mu + b.\]
We need to solve this equation for \(u\).  
Rearranging gives
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
-{1\over m} u - m u &=& b - q - {p\over m} \\
           -\left({1\over m} + m\right) u &=& b - q - {p\over m }\\
\end{array}
\]
Thus
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
u &=&{b - q - {p\over m} \over -{1\over m} - m} \\
               &=& {-bm +mq +p \over 1 + m^2} \\ 
\end{array}\]
and
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
v &=& mu + b \\
&=&{-bm^2 + m^2q +mp + b + m^2b\over 1 + m^2} \\
&=&{ m^2q +mp + b \over 1 + m^2} \\
\end{array}
\]

We are now ready to compute \(d\).  To avoid square roots we compute
\(d^2\) instead:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
d^2 &=& \left(v-q\right)^2 + \left(u-p\right)^2 \\
&=&{\left(m^2q + mp + b - q -m^2q\right)^2 \over \left(1+m^2\right)^2}
+ {\left(-bm +mq + p -p -m^2p\right)^2\over \left(1+m^2\right)^2} \\
&=&{1 \over \left(1+m^2\right)^2}\left(\left(mp + b - q\right)^2 + m^2\left(q - mp-b\right)^2 \right) \\
&=&{\left(q - mp -b\right)^2 \over 1+m^2}\\
&=&{d^2_{\hbox{vert}} \over 1+m^2} \\ 
\end{array}\]
as expected. Taking square roots gives:
\[ d=\frac{d_{\hbox{vert}}} {\sqrt{1+m^2}}
 \qquad(*)\]


$BBOLD The Geometry$EBOLD

As alluded to above, one can work out the formula
\((*)\)
strictly from geometric principles.  Actually, this is a lot simpler,
but one has to see it, and doing the above brute force algebra approach,
while a bit heavy, is sure to work.


Consider  the Figure: $BR
\{image("fig.gif", height => 300, width => 350);\}


 It
shows the points \(P\) and \(Q\), and the line
\(L\).  Let's label the length of the vertical side \(s\), the length of
the horizontal side \(r\), and the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) \(h\),
as indicated.  Since the two small angles in a right triangle add to
90 degrees, the
angle \(QPS\) equals the \(QRP\), and the angle \(QSP\) equals the angle
\(RPQ\).  In other words, the triangles \(RQP\), \(PQS\), and \(RPS\)
are all $BITALIC
similar $EITALIC , and the ratio of corresponding lengths of sides are
equal.

(Note
that \(s\) in the Figure means vertical distance whereas in the body
of the question it means the slope of the perpendicular line.)

Again, to avoid square roots and absolute values, we consider
squares of distances.
Note that 
\[m^2 = {s^2\over r^2} \]
by the definition of \(m\) (as rise divided by run).

Moreover,
by the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[{s^2\over h^2} = {r^2 + s^2 \over r^2} = 1 +{s^2 \over r^2} = 1+m^2. \]
Thus, 
\[h^2 = {s^2 \over 1+m^2} \] which is our result \((*)\)
