The purpose of this problem is to help you prepare for Exam 2.
There will be 10 problems on the exam, of the following types:

$BR

$BR 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/linear/",
"Solving linear equations")\}, for example
\[\frac{x+1}{x+2} = \frac{x+3}{x-4}.\]
Multiply with both denominators on both sides, cancel the \(x^2\)
term, and solve the resulting linear equation. 
The solution of this particular equation is
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}.



EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-5/4));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/ineq/",
"Solving inequalities.")\}  You process inequalities like equalities,
by doing the same thing on both sides of the inequality.  The main
difference is that when you multiply with a negative number you
reverse the inequality. For example, the inequality
\[ 3x +2 < 5x -1 \]
can be solved by subtracting \(5x\) and \(2\) on both sides, followed
by a division by \(-2\), giving 
\(x > \)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.  Note that the inequality sign have been
reversed.  
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3/2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/abseq/",
"Solving Equations involving absolute values.")\}  The basic
principle is that every absolute value may equal the expression of
which you take the absolute value, or  its negative.  For example,
\(|x-2|\)  may equal \(x-2\) or \(-(x-2)\).  So you consider all
possible combinations of the absolute values, and if there are a lot
of them you reduce the number of cases judiciously. 
For example,
the equation
\[|x-1|=|2x+1| \] has the obvious solution \(x=0\) and the 
less obvious solution 
\(x = \)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight/",
"Drawing the graphs")\} of various forms of equations defining
straight lines.  For example, the graph of the equation 
\[x+y-1 = 0\] is given in the accompanying Figure:
$PAR
\{image("p4.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\}

$BR Given information about a line, like a point on the line and the
slope of the line, draw the graph, and write down its equation in some
specified form, like the slope intercept form.  You can practice this
kind of thing by going to
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/lineMachine/", "this
interactive page")\}.

$BR Computing the intersection of two lines, graphically and
algebraically. Algebraically you can do this by writing the
point-intercept forms of the two lines, equating the right hand sides,
solving for \(x\), and evaluating to obtain \(y\).  You did this in
past WeBWorK problems where you computed the distance of a point from
a line.  Go back to those problems to refresh your memory if
necessary.

$BR \{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/functions/",
"The concept of functions")\}, particularly evaluating functions at
numbers and algebraic expressions.  For example if \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x+1}\]
then 
\[f(f(x)) = \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x+1}} \] which of course can be simplified.

$BR Evaluating powers like \(64^{-\frac{5}{6}} = \)   \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/32));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/complex/",
"Combining complex numbers")\} using the usual complex arithmetic, as
practiced on several past WeBWorK Problems.

$BR A \{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/words/",
"word problem")\} involving 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/scale/",
"scaling")\}.  Remember, the key idea is
that if you multiply every linear dimension of an object with a
certain factor then you multiply the area of the volume with the
square of that factor, and the volume (and weight) with the cube of
that factor.
