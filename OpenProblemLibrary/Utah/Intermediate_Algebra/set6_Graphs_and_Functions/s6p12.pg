Consider again the line \(L\) defined by
 \[y=\frac{1}{2}x+1.\]
The line that is perpendicular to \(L\) and passes through the point 
\((3,0)\) can be written in 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight/index.html#slopeintercept",
"slope-intercept form")\} as

\(y = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \} \(x +\)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
The perpendicular line has slope \(-2\) and therefore can be written
as \[y = -2x +b.\] To compute the \(y\)-intercept \(b\) we use the fact
that the perpendicular line passes through \((3,0\)) which gives the
equation \[0=-2\times 3+b\] which implies that \[b=6.\]
