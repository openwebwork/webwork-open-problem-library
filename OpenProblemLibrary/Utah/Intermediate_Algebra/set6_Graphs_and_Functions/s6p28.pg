TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you are given a function \(y=f(x)\), and you consider 
shifting and reflecting the graph of \(f\).  
Indicate whether the following statements are  true (T) of false (F).

$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} The graph of \(g(x) = f(x) + 1 \) is obtained by 
shifting the 
graph of \(f\) up one unit.
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} The graph of \(g(x) = f(x) - 1 \) is obtained by 
shifting the 
graph of \(f\) down one unit.
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} The graph of \(g(x) = f(x - 1) \) is obtained by 
shifting the 
graph of \(f\) right one unit.
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} The graph of \(g(x) = f(x + 1) \) is obtained by 
shifting the 
graph of \(f\) left one unit.
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} The graph of \(g(x) = f(-x) \) is obtained by 
reflecting the 
graph of \(f\) in the \(y\) axis.
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} The graph of \(g(x) = -f(x) \) is obtained by 
reflecting the 
graph of \(f\) in the \(x\) axis.
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));
