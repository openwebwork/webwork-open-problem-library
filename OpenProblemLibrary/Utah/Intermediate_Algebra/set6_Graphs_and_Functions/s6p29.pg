SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
For this problem it is best to draw a picture of the box and the
distances involved.  The first question can be answered by drawing the
top face of the box and noticing that the distance is the length of
the diagonal which can be computed by the Pythagorean theorem as
\(\sqrt{4^2+5^2} = \sqrt{41}\). To obtain the answer to the second question draw another right triangle, one side of which is the diagonal whose length you just computed, and the other side of which is the height of the box.
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem again we obtain \(\sqrt{\sqrt{41}^2+8^2}=
\sqrt{41+64}=
\sqrt{105}.\)
Note that this length equals \(\sqrt{4^2+5^2+8^2}\).  In general,
the length \(d\) of the space diagonal of a box with the dimensions
\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is
\[d = \sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}.\]
