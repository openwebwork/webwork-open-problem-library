Match the phrases given below with the letters labeling the algebraic expression.
You may have to simplify your expression to recognize it as the correct one.

     ##the correct answers are obtained by applying
     ##the inverse (adjoint) permutation to the captions.

$BR Hint:
To recognize the correspondence between the phrases and the 
algebraic expressions write down the expression defined by the phrase
and manipulate it to get it in the form of the given expressions.  You
may want to do problems 22 through 36 before doing this one.  They deal
with algebraic expressions more directly.
