Consider the following expressions:

\[A= a+\frac{b}{c}\]
and

\[B= \frac{a+b}{c}\]

For each of the WeBWorK phrases below write  A if they define
\(A\) and  B if they define \(B\).

You need to get all answers correct before obtaining credit.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR
$BR ((a+b)/c) is the same as B.  It just has one pair of
parentheses around the standard form of B. 
$BR a+(b/c) is the same as A.  It has an unnecessary pair
of parentheses around the ratio  a/b.  You might include this
pair if you are not sure you remember the rules of precedence
correctly, and you want to be positive that the expression is
evaluated in the correct sequence.
$BR (a+(b/c)) is the same as the previous expression (and the
same as A, except it has an additional pair of parentheses
around it.  Actually no parentheses at all are needed in this
expression, but you can use them to remind yourself what's going on,
or to be sure WeBWorK understands what you are trying to say.
