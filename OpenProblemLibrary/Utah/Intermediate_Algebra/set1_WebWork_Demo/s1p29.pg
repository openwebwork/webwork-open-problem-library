TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));


In mathematics, lower and upper case letters mean different things.
The letter \(a\) is not the same as the letter \(A\).
Keep that in mind when answering the questions below, using T or  F  as in the
preceding questions.


$BR   \(a\)  \{ ans_rule(4) \}  \(a\)
$BR 

EOT

ANS(str_cmp("T"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR
$BR \(a=a\).  This is obvious. Despite its simplicity,
mathematicians do like to give this property a name. It is called the
$BITALIC reflexive property $EITALIC of equality.

$BR \(a \neq A\).  Lower and upper case letters 
have distinct meanings. A frequent source of errors when working with
WeBWorK is to use upper instead of lower case, or vice versa.  

$BR \(a+A = A+a\) for all real numbers \(a\) and \(A\), despite
\(a\) and \(A\) being different.  This is simply another (if
confusing) ways of stating the commutative law of addition.
