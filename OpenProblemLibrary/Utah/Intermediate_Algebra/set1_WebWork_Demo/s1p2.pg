The purpose of this exercise
is to illustrate further the use of the buttons on this page and to
show you the most common way in which WeBWorK processes partially
correct problems.  Try entering incorrect answers in the answer fields
below, to see what happens.  (This time WeBWorK will reject 
algebraic
expressions since I told it to expect a numerical answer.) 
  

$BR
$BBOLD Type the number 4 here:~~~ $EBOLD
\{ ans_rule(40) \}.
$BR
EOT
$answer = 4;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
$BBOLD Type the number 5 here:~~~ $EBOLD
\{ ans_rule(40) \}.
$BR
EOT
$answer = 5;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
This problem is much like the preceding one.
