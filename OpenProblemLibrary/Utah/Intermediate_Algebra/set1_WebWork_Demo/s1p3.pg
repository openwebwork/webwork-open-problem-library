In the first few problems, now that you are familiar with the basic
mechanics of WeBWorK, you will be asked to evaluate some arithmetic
expressions and enter the answer as a number into WeBWorK.  You may of
course use a calculator.  In later problems you will be able to enter
the answer as an arithmetic expression, but at present your answer
must be a number such as 4, -4, or 17.5.

$BR
Evaluate the expression
$BR \( $a($b+$c) \) = \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
(Remember that by convention 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/precedence/index.html#miss",
"a missing arithmetic operator means
multiplication")\} .)
EOT

$answer = ($a)*($b+$c);
$s = $b+$c;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The desired number is of course \($a\times $s = $answer\).  Note that a missing operator means
multiplication, and the parentheses indicate that in this case the
addition is to be carried out first.
