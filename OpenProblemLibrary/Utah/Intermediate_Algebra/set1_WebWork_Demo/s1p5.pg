$a = random(2,9,3);
$b = random(1,9,1);
$c = random(1,9,1);

if ( ( $b+$c )% 3 == 0 ) {$b++;}

$s = $b+$c;




TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR
Evaluate the expression
$BR \( $a/($b+$c) \) = \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$BR 
Enter your answer as a decimal number listing at least 4 decimal
digits. (WeBWorK will reject your answer if it differs by more than
one tenth of 1 percent from what it thinks the answer is.) 
EOT

$answer = ($a)/($b+$c);
$round =  $answer*10000;
$round = int $round;
$round = $round/10000;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The parentheses again indicate that the addition is to be performed first.
We obtain
\[ $a/($b+$c) = \frac{$a}{$s} \approx $round .\]

$BR The symbol \(\approx\) means "approximately equal".  The decimals
don't terminate but we write down only a few.  Four digits usually
suffice in WeBWorK.

END_SOLUTION

ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"strict"));
