TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR
Enter here \{ ans_rule(30) \} the expression \[\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]


$BR Note: this is an expression that gives the solution of a $BITALIC 
quadratic equation $EITALIC by the $BITALIC quadratic formula $EITALIC .  We 
will learn much more about it
later in the semester.
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("(-b+sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/(2a)", vars=>["a","b","c"]));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The simplest answer to this problem is
(-b+sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/(2a). We will spend a great deal of time
studying the solution of quadratic equations, which gives rise to this
expression.  Often students are told to memorize this expressions but
there are better ways!
