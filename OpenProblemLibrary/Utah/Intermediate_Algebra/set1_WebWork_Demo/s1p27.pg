For each of the WeBWorK phrases below enter a T (true) if the
two given phrases describe the same algebraic expression
and an  F (false) otherwise.  One way you can decide whether the
phrases are equivalent is to substitute specific values for \(a\),
\(b\), etc.  If you get two different results the two phrases are
certainly not equivalent.  If you get the same values there is small
chance this happened accidentally for just that choice of particular
values. In any case, pay close attention to when these phrases are 
equivalent and when they are not, it will help you tremendously with
future WeBWorK assignments.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD This problem provides the first step into a
major subject of this class: to recognize when two algebraic
expressions are equivalent.

$BR
$BR \(a+b = b+a\) for all real numbers \(a\) and \(b\).  This is 
$BITALIC the commutative law of addition. $EITALIC
$BR  \(a+b+c = a+(b+c) = (a+b) + c\) is true for all real numbers
\(a\), \(b\),\(c\).  This is $BITALIC the associate law of addition. 
$EITALIC
$BR  \(a-b-c\) equals \(a-(b-c)\) only when \(c=0\).  It is not true
in general. For example, if \(a=3\), \(b =1 \), and \(c=1\) then 
\(a-b-c= 1\) but \(a-(b-c) = 3 - 0 = 3\) which, of course, is
different from 1.   In other words, as you recognized in some of the earlier
problems on this set, the order of subtraction matters.  By
comparison, the order of additions (or multiplications) does not matter.
