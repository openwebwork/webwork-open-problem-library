TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR The square \(x^2\) of a number \(x\) simply means the product of
\(x\) with itself.  For example, \(3^2=3*3=9\). You can enter a number
such as \(3^2\) as $BITALIC 3**2 $EITALIC .  (An expression such as
\(3^2\) or \(x^2\) is called a $BITALIC power $EITALIC .  We will learn a 
great
deal more about powers during this semester.)

$BR
Enter here \{ ans_rule(20) \} the expression \(x^2\)

EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("x**2", vars=>["x"]));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR

The square root  \(\sqrt{x}\) of a number \(x\) is a number whose
square equals \(x\).  For example \(\sqrt{25} = 5\) since \(5^2=5*5 = 25\).


$BR

To enter square roots you can use the function $BITALIC
sqrt $EITALIC .  For example, to enter the square root of 2 
you can type $BITALIC sqrt $EITALIC (2).  


Enter here \{ ans_rule(20) \} the expression \(\sqrt{a}\)

EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt{a}", vars=>["a"]));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  You simply enter x**2 and
sqrt(a), respectively.
