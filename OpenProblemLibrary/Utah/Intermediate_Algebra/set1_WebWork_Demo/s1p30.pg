Much of this course will center around the manipulation of algebraic
expressions, often with the goal of solving an equation.  This
exercise is the first step in this direction.
Again, indicated with T or F if the two expressions are equivalent.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR

$BR \(a*(b+c) = a*b+a*c\).  This is $BBOLD THE DISTRIBUTIVE LAW$EBOLD. 
It usually is written without the asterisks:
\[a(b+c) = ab + ac\]
By the commutative law of multiplication it is also true that 
\[(b+c)a = ba + ca = ab + ac\]

 If you are at all uncertain about what it means substitute some
numbers for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). $BBOLD Not applying the distributive
correctly is the largest single source of errors in intermediate
algebra. $EBOLD  Make sure you appreciate this formula.  

Note that the previously
mentioned fact \[(a+b)^2 \neq a^2+b^2\] is an instance of misapplying
the distributive law, because in reality: \[ \begin{array}{rcl}
(a+b)^2 &=& (a+b)(a+b) \\
        &=& a(a+b) + b(a+b) \\
        &=& aa+ab+ba+bb \\
        &=& a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ \end{array} \]

$BR  \(1/(a+b) \neq 1/a+1/b\).  To see this use 
our by now familiar example \(a=b=1\).


$BR It is in fact true that
\[1/a/a = \frac{\frac{1}{a}}{a} = \frac{1}{a^2} = 1/(a*a) \]
for all \(a\neq 0\).
