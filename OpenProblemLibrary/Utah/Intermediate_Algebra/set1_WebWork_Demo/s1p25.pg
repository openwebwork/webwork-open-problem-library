Consider again the formula for the solution of a quadratic equation:
 \[x= \frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]

For each of the WeBWorK phrases below enter a T (true) if the
phrase describes \(x\), correctly, and a F (false) otherwise.

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR
$BR  -b+sqrt(b**2-4*a*c)/2a  means \[-b
+\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2} \times a\] which is quite different.  The
reason for the confusion is that division and multiplication have the
same precedence and proceed from left to right unless otherwise
indicated with parentheses.  Thus we divide by 2, and then multiply
the result with a.  Also the scope of the division is only the square
root since division comes before the addition to \(b\).

$BR (-b+sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/2a is a little better in that \(-b\)
is included in the numerator, but the final \(a\) is still in the
numerator rather than the denominator.  The expression means:
\[\frac{-b +\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2} \times a\].

$BR The last expression,  (-b+sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/(2a) is the
correct answer for Problem 23.
