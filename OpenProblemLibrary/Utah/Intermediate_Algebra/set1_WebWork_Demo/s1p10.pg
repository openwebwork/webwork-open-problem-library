TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The key idea in Algebra is to use variables in addition to numbers.
Sometimes we need to replace variables with specific numbers.  That's
called \{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/algebra/index.html#evaluate",
"evaluating an algebraic expression")\}. 
For example, if \(a = 2\) then \(3a=6\), and we say that we evaluated
the expression \(3a\) at \(a=2\). 
We'll do this sort of thing all semester long, and in this problem you
get your first experience with evaluating algebraic expressions.  
Again, the emphasis in these exercises is on understanding the rules
of arithmetic precedence. 
$BR




Let \(a = $a, \quad b = $b, \quad c = $c.\)

Then \( a-b/c =\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

EOT

ANS(num_cmp($a-$b/$c, mode=>"strict", relTol=>1));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and
\( (a-b)/c =\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

EOT

ANS(num_cmp(($a-$b)/$c, mode=>"strict", relTol=>1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
As usual, enter your answers as decimal numbers with at least 4 digits.
EOT

$r1=$a-$b/$c;	

$r1 = (int $r1*10000+0.5)/10000;

$r2 = ($a-$b)/$c;
$r2 = (int $r2*10000+0.5)/10000;
$amb = $a-$b;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
In the first problem we do the division first:
 \( a-b/c = $a -\frac{$b}{$c} \approx $r1;  \)
$BR In the second problems we do the subtraction first, as required by
the parentheses:  


\[ (a-b)/c =\frac{$a-$b}{$c} = \frac{$amb}{$c} \approx $r2 \]
