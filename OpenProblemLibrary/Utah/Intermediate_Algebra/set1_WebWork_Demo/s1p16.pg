TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In this and the following problems you will practice entering
algebraic expressions into WeBWorK.  Remember the \{
htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/precedence","Rules
of Arithmetic Precedence")\} and $BBOLD use parentheses $EBOLD to make
your meaning clear.  Most of the difficulties students have with WeBWorK 
are due to not appreciating the precise rules that govern the
interpretation of what you enter.  This is not just a matter of
WeBWorK understanding what you are trying to say,  The rules are used
universally all over the world.  Appreciating and applying them
properly is also crucial, for example, in computer programming.
Make sure you understand what's going in these problems.  If you enter
a wrong expression use the Preview Button to see what WeBWorK thinks
you have entered.

 $BR

We start simply.
Enter here \{ ans_rule(20) \} the expression \(a+b\).

EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("a+b", vars=>["a","b"]));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The simplest way to enter this expression is of course simply to type
\(a+b\).  However, you can also enter things like \((a+b)\) or
\(((a)+(b))\).
$BR $BBOLD If in doubt, use parentheses! $EBOLD
