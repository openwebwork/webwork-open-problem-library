The reason why $BBOLD Mathematics $EBOLD is required for so many subjects is 
that
it can be used to solve problems outside of mathematics, the dreaded
$BBOLD word problems $EBOLD .  There will be many word problems in this 
class,
usually leading to a mathematical problem of the kind we are discussing
at the time.  Students don't like word problems because they involve
the extra layer of converting the word problem to a math problem.  But
keep in mind that math classes are the only kind of classes you take
where some problems are  
$BBOLD not $EBOLD word problems! 

$BR  This first word problem of this course can be solved by deriving
and solving an equation, but it can also be solved essentially by
guessing and modifying the answer until it fits, without any algebraic
manipulation. We will revisit it in the future in a more complicated
setting.

$BR 
You buy a pot and its lid for a total of $DOLLAR 11.  The sales
person tells you that the pot by itself costs $DOLLAR 10 more than
the lid.  The price of the pot is $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \} and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(10.5, mode=>"strict"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
the price of the lid is $DOLLAR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(0.5, mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Most people start out by guessing that the price
of the pot is $DOLLAR 10, and that of the $DOLLAR 1.  Then the
total price is indeed $DOLLAR 11, but the difference between the
price of the pot and that of the lid is only $DOLLAR 9, not $DOLLAR 10!
Well, since the difference is too small we need to make the
price of the lid less, and that the of the pot more.  The correct
answer is that the price of the pot is $DOLLAR 10.5, and that of
the lid $DOLLAR 0.5.
