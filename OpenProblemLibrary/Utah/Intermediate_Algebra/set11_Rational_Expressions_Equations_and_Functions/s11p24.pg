(Note that your answer is an algebraic expression involving \(d\)).
$BR 
A circular swimming pool has a depth \(d\) and a radius that
equals five times its depth.  A rectangular pool has the same depth as
the circular pool.  Its width is four feet more than three times its
depth and its length is two feet less than six times its depth.  The
ratio of the rectangular pool's volume to the circular pool's volume
is
 \{ ans_rule(30) \}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("d*(6*d-2)*(3*d+4)/(25*pi*d**3)", vars=>["d"]));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
The volume of each pool equals the product of its depth and the area
of its cross section. The area of a circle with radius \(r\) equals
\(\pi r^2\).  The area of a rectangle with sides \(a\) and \(b\) equals
\(ab\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The volume \(C\) of the circular swimming pool equals 
\[C = d\times \pi (5d)^2\]
and the area \(R\)  of the rectangular pool equals
\[R = d (3d+4)(6d-2)\] 
The ratio equals 
\[\frac{R}{C} = \frac{ d (3d+4)(6d-2)}{d\times \pi (5d)^2} =
\frac{(3d+4)(6d-2)}{25\pi d^2}.\]
