Hint: If you are having difficulties with this problem
it' s probably because you are looking for something that is much
complicated than the actual answer.  Think about the constant term in
numerator and denominator.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Divide numerator and denominator by \(x\) to get
\[\frac{x^2+2x}{x^2-x}  = \frac{x+2}{x-1}.\]
