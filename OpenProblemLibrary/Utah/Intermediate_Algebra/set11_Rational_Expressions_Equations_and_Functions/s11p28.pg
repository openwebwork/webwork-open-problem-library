I found the following definition in $BBOLD The Harper Collins Dictionary 
of 
Mathematics $EBOLD :

$BR
" $BBOLD golden mean $EBOLD , $BBOLD golden section $EBOLD , or $BBOLD 
extreme and mean
ratio $EBOLD , $BITALIC n. $EITALIC the proportion of the division of a 
line so that the
smaller is to the larger as the larger is to the whole, or of the
sides of a rectangle so that the ratio of their difference to the
smaller equals that of the smaller to the larger, supposed in
classical esthetic theory to be uniquely pleasing to the eye." 

$BR Those Greek were onto something!  Apparently that "extreme and
mean ratio" is a specific number.  In fact it is \{ ans_rule(15) \}.  By 
the
way, don't get put off by the above piece of language which is
opaque only because of its brevity. The
Harper Dictionary of Mathematics is excellent, despite occasional
idiosyncrasies.  It's also an inexpensive paperback that I use almost
every day, and that I recommend highly as an addition to your library.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's focus on the first definition: "the proportion of the division
of a line so that the smaller is to the larger as the larger is to the
whole".  In order to divide that "line" into a smaller and a larger
the line needs to have a finite length. So it's really what we would
call a "line segment" or an "interval".  Let's suppose it's one
unit (like one foot, if you like) long and the larger piece of it has
a length of \(x\) units.  Then the shorter piece has a length of \(1-x\)
units.  The sentence above turns into \[\frac{1-x}{x} = \frac{x}{1}\]

Now we are in business!  Multiplying with \(x\) on both sides gives
\[1-x = x^2 \] or \[ x^2+x-1  =0\] which is a quadratic equation in
standard form that has the solutions \[x=-\frac{1}{2} \pm
\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}.\] The ratio is positive and so only the solution
with the plus sign is relevant.

$BR For your info, the Harper Dictionary calls that ratio \(G\) and
goes on to say:

$BR "This yields \[G=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} = 0.618033988\dots\] of which 
the inverse is \(1.61180033988\ldots = G+1\), which is also sometimes 
referred to as the golden ratio.  It is a consequence of the definition 
that if one draws a rectangle with sides in the golden ratio (a $BITALIC 
golden rectangle $EITALIC ), and then removes from it a square, the 
rectangle that 
remains has the same proportions as the original.  If this process is 
repeated as shown in Fig. 172 [omitted here], then the successive points 
of division lie on a LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL. The golden mean is also the 
limit both of the CONTINUED FRACTION 
\[\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\dots}}}}\] and of the 
ratio of successive terms of the FIBONACCI NUMBERS" [which are 
\(1,~1,~2,~3,~5,~8,~13,\ldots\), each being the sum of the two preceding 
numbers].
