TEXT(beginproblem());


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
When two resistors \(S\) and \(T\) are connected in parallel their
combined resistance \(R\) is given by the expression
\[R=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{S}+\frac{1}{T}}.\] This expression can be
rewritten as a rational expression in \(S\) and \(T\).
The numerator of that expression is
\{ ans_rule(15) \} and its denominator is
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("S*T", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["S","T"]));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(15) \}
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("S+T", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2]], vars=>["S","T"]));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
Rational expressions work exactly like fractions.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Multiplying with \(R\) and \(T\) in numerator and denominator gives
\[R=\frac{RS}{R+T}.\]
EOT
