$BR
 A car starts on a
trip and travels at a speed of 55 mph.  Two hours later, a second car
starts on the same trip and travels at a speed of 65 mph.
$BR
When the second car has been on the road for \(t\) hours, the first car has traveled 
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} miles

and the second car has traveled
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} miles.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("65*t", vars=>["t"]));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
At time \(t\) the distance between the first car and the second car is 
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} miles.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("-10*t+110", vars=>["t"]));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
The ratio of the distance the second car has traveled and the distance the first car has traveled is
 \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(65*t)/(55*(t+2))", vars=>["t"]));

$BR
The second car catches up with the first car
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} hours after the departure of the first car.  (Those are some determined drivers!)
EOT

$BR Hint: 
If you are having trouble with the last part of this problem reread
the question carefully.   It's not my wording, and if it's any
consolation, I got hung up on it myself at first.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
It's pretty clear that after the second car has been on the road for
\(t\) hours it has traveled \(65t\) miles.  The first car has been
traveling two hours longer, and so it has covered a distance of
\(55(t+2)\) miles.  The distance between the two cars is
\[55(t+2) -65t = 110 - 10t.\] The ratio of the distance is of course
just \(\frac{65t}{55(t+2)}\).  The second car catches up with the
first car when \(t=11\) which is \(11\) hours after the second car's
departure.  However, it is \(13\) hours after the $BBOLD first$EBOLD
car's departure.
