$BR 
Hint: 
There isn't much to simplify here, except that the sign of the leading
term in the given numerator is not correct according to the
instructions at the beginning of this homework set.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Divide (or multiply) numerator and
denominator by \(-1\) to get \[\frac{x-1}{-x-1}=\frac{-x+1}{x+1}. \]
This makes the leading coefficient of the denominator equal to \(+1\) as
required in the header of this homework set.
