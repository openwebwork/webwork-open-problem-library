The speed of a commuter plane is 150 miles per hour slower than that
of a passenger jet.  The commuter plane travels 450 miles in the same
time the jet travels 1150 miles.  The speed of the commuter plane is 
\{ ans_rule(5) \} miles per hour and

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's denote the speed of commuter plane by \(c\) mph.
Then
the speed of the jet is \(c+150\) mph.  If the two planes travel for the
same amount of time then the ratio of their speed equals the ratio of
the distances covered.  Thus we have the equation
\[\frac{c+150}{c} = \frac{1150}{ 450}= \frac{23}{9}.\]
We multiply with \(9c\) on both sides and obtain
\[9(c+150) = 23c\]
This is a linear equation that can be rewritten as
\[9c + 9\times 150 = 23c \]
which turns into
\[1,350 = 14 c.\]
Thus \[c = \frac{1,350}{14}\approx 96.43.\]
The speed of the commuter plane is approximately 96.43 miles per hour
and that of the jet is approximately 246.43 miles per hour.  Both
planes are slow in their class.
