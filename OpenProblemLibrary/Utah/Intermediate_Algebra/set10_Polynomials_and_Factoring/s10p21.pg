TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You have an aquarium that is one foot higher than it is wide, and one
foot longer than it is high.  It holds 6 cubic feet of water. 
The width of the aquarium is 
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet,
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
its height is 
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet,

and its length
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet.

$BR Hint: 
Set up a cubic equation.  Think about its approximate solution and
then make an inspired guess.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
If we denote the width of the aquarium
by \(x\) we obtain the equation \[x(x+1)(x+2) = 6.\] This can be
rewritten as the cubic equation \[x^3+3x^2+2x-6 = 0 \qquad(*)\] in
standard form (although in this particular problem that's not
particularly useful).  We have to find a solution of that equation.
\(6\) equals \(1\times 2 \times 3\) and so it's pretty obvious that
\(x=1\) is the solution.  If it's not obvious, graphing the function
would reveal that fact.  Physically it seems obvious that there is
only one shape that has the required properties, and aquarium that's 1
by by 3 feet.  Mathematically this is reflected in the fact that the
remaining solutions of \((*)\) are the conjugate complex pair \(-2 \pm
\sqrt{2}i.\)
