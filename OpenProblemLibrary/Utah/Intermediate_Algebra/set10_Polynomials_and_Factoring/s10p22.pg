This problem is a little more challenging. Most exercises in a class
like this one can be done very quickly.  However, the values of the
techniques we learn in this and other basic classes lies in their
being building blocks for the solutions of complicated problems.  Here
is a problem that requires quite a few steps, each of which is one that we
have practiced in this class.  But we have to put them all together
to reach the final answer.

$BR
Let
\[f(n) = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2. \]
Thus 
\[\begin{array}{rll}
 f(1) & = 1^2 &= 1, & \cr 
 f(2) & =  1^2 + 2^2 &= 5, & \cr
 f(3) & = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 &= 14,  & \cr
 f(4) & = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 +4^2 &= 30, & \cr
\end{array}
\] 
etc.
$BR
It turns out that \(f\) is a  polynomial of degree 3 in \(n\).  
Figure out the coefficients of \(f\):

One way to solve the problem is described in this

$BR Hint: 
Write \[ \begin{array}{rcl} f(n) &=& \phantom{+\quad} a \\ && +\quad b
(n-1) \\ && +\quad c(n-1)(n-2) \\&& +\quad d(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\\
\end{array} \] where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\) are constants that we
still have to determine.  The significance of writing \(f\) in this
form is that when \(n=1\) only the first term is non-zero, when \(n=2\) only the first two terms are non-zero, and so on.
Note that \(f(1) = a\), and so \(a\) must be 1 (since the terms
involving \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are zero).  Knowing
\(a\), ask what \(f(2)\) is, use that value to figure out \(b\), and
go on from there.  Once we know \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\),
we can convert \(f\) to standard form.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's follow the hint.
We already know that \(a=1\).
Let's now consider \(n=2.\) 
$BR
As mentioned above, the significance of writing \(f\) as stated is
that only the first two terms are non-zero in that case.  We obtain:
\(f(2) = 5 = a + b(2-1) = 1 +b \)
which implies that \(b=4.\)
Proceeding to \(n=3\) we obtain
\(f(3) = 14 = a + 2 b +2c = 1+8 + 2c =9+2c.\)
Thus \(c=\frac{5}{2}\)
Finally, setting \(n = 4\) we obtain
\(f(4) = 30 = a+ 3b+ 6c + 6d = 1+12 +15 +6d = 28 +6d.\)
Hence \(d=\frac{1}{3}.\)
Substituting in our expression for \(f\) we obtain

\[
\begin{array}{rl}
f(n) &= 1 + 4(n-1) +\frac{5}{2}(n-1)(n-2) + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) = \\ 
&= 1 + 4n -4 + \frac{5}{2}(n^2-3n+2) + \frac{1}{3}(n^2-3n+2)(n-3) =\\ 
&= -3 + 4n  +\frac{5}{2}n^2 - \frac{15}{2}n + 5 +\frac{1}{3}(n^3-3n^2+2n - 3n^2+9n -6) = \\ 
&= \frac{1}{3}n^3 + \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{6}n + 0.\\
\end{array}
\]

Substituting \(n=1,2,3,4\) we see that we get the right answers.
