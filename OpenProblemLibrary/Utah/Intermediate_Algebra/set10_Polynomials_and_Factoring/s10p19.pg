TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A boat travels at a speed of 20 miles per hour in still water.   It
travels 48 miles upstream, and then returns to the starting point in a
total of five hours.  The speed of the current is 
\{ ans_rule(5) \} miles per hour.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's denote the speed 
of the current by \(c\). The boat travels upstream at a speed of
\(20-c\) and downstream at a speed of \(20+c\). In each direction it
travels 48 miles.  When traveling at a constant speed, time is the
ratio of distance and speed.  We therefore have to solve the equation
\[\frac{48}{20+c} + \frac{48}{20-c} = 5.\]
Multiplying on both sides with \((20+c)\times (20-c)=400-c^2\) gives
\[48(20-c) + 48 (20+c) = 5 \times (400-c^2).\]
This simplifies to 
\[48\times 40 = 1920 = 2000-5c^2.\]
Thus \(c^2=16\) and \(c=4\).
