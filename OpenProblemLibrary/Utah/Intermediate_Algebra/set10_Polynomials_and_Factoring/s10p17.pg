TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The polynomial \[p(x)= x^5 - x^4 - 13x^3 + 13x^2 + 36x - 36\]
has five real roots.  One of them is \(x=1\).
List the other four in increasing sequence:

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/euclid/",
"Long division")\}
 gives \[p(x) = \left(x-1\right)\left(x^4 - 13x^2 + 36\right).\] 
We have to solve the equation 
\[x^4 - 13x^2 + 36 = 0.\]
Note that there are only even powers of \(x\).  We can think of this
equation as an equation in \(x^2\).  Indeed, if we define \(z=x^2\) the
equation turns into
\[z^2-13z+36 = 0.\]
This can be solved for \(z\) by completing the square, by the
quadratic formula, or by observing that
\[z^2-13z+36 = (z-4)(z-9).\]
The solutions of this equation are \(z=4\) and \(z=9\).  Hence
\(x=\pm\sqrt{4} = \pm 2\) or \(x=\pm\sqrt{9} = \pm 3.\)
The roots of \(p\) are
\[ -3,\quad -2, \quad 1, \quad 2, \quad\hbox{and}\quad 3.\]
