TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In this problem you are given two polynomials \(p\) and \(q\)
and you are asked to find their greatest common factor.  I recommend
that you use the Euclidean Algorithm. (It's really simple in this
case.)  After you compute the common factor divide it by a suitable
integer so that the leading coefficient is 1.

\[p(x) = x^4+2x^3+6x^2+8x+8.\]
\[q(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 +8x^2+8x +16.\]

$BR

The greatest common factor (i.e., the one of the highest degree) of \(p\) and \(q\) is
   \{ ans_rule(15) \} .

$BR Hint: The polynomials have the same degree and the
same leading term.  The quotient is 1 and to get the remainder you
just compute the difference.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD



We apply the Euclidean Algorithm exactly as we do for
numbers and obtain: \( x^4 + 2x^3 +8x^2+8x +16 =
1\times(x^4+2x^3+6x^2+8x+8) + 2x^2+8.\) Polynomial factors matter only
up to a constant, so we consider the remainder to be \((2x^2+8)/2=
x^2+4\) and find \(x^4+2x^3+6x^2+8x+8 = (x^2+4)(x^2+2x+2) + 0. \) The
expression \(x^2+4\) is therefore a factor of \(p\) and of \(q\).
Dividing \(p\) and \(q\) by this factor gives
\[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{x^2+2x+2}{x^2+2x+4}.\]
