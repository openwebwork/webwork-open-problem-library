TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider the the polynomial \[p(x)=x^3 - (a + 1)x^2 + (a - 6)x + 6a\]
where \(x\) is the variable and \(a\) is a parameter.  (That means we
think of it as a particular real number, but we don't specify which.) It is easy to
check that \(p(a) = 0.\) 
$BR
\(p\) has two more real roots.  They are 
$BR
 \{ ans_rule(5) \} and

ANS(num_cmp(-2));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(5) \} (in increasing sequence).
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
Divide by \((x-a)\) and solve the resulting quadratic equation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Synthetic division by \(x-a\) gives:
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
a: & 1 & -(a+1)  & a-6 & 6a \\
   &   &    a    & -a  &-6a \\
   & 1 & -1      &  -6 &  0 \\
\end{array}
\]

Hence
\[p(x) = (x-a)(x^2-x-6).\]
The roots of the quadratic factor are -2 and 3.
