\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/rational/",
"Rational Functions of Expressions")\} are
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/precedence/index.html#ops",
"ratios (or quotients)")\} of
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly",
"polynomials")\}.
They are processed exactly like 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/fractions",
"fractions")\}.

Polynomials in standard form are sums of powers of the
variable. Numbers in decimal representation are sums of powers of
\(10\).  Polynomials are processed much like numbers, except that you
cannot trade some powers of \(x\) for a higher power of \(x\).  Thus
the manipulation of polynomials is in some ways actually easier than
the corresponding manipulation of decimal numbers!

An example for this fact is provided by
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/euclid/",
"long division")\}.

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD


 We use long division to find
\[
\begin{array}{llllllll}
    &     &     &   &        &     & 2x  & + 4 \\
x^2 & - x & + 2 & | & 2x^3   &+2x^2 & +5x & -5 \\
    &     &     &   & 2x^3  &-2x^2& +4x & \\
    &     &     &   &        &4x^2&+x  & -5     \\
    &     &     &   &        &4x^2&-4x & +8     \\
    &     &     &   &        &     &5x  & -13  \\
\end{array}
\]
   
Thus the quotient is \(2x+4\) and the remainder \(5x-13\).
