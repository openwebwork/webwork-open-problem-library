\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/numbers/",
"The Number System")\} is built in stages to facilitate the four basic
operations.  It is extended to
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/complex/",
"complex numbers")\} to facilitate the computation of square roots of
negative real numbers.  All you need to remember to work with complex
numbers is that they work exactly like algebraic expressions of the
form \(a+bi\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, $BBOLD except $EBOLD
that \[i^2=-1.\]  There is a trick related to dividing complex
numbers: you multiply numerator and denominator with the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/complex/index.html#conj",
"conjugate complex")\} of the denominator.  This makes the denominator
real, and the standard form of the complex number follows from the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/numbers/index.html#laws",
"distributive law")\}.

Express the complex fraction below in standard form.  Remember that
the real or the imaginary part may be negative.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

 We multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate
complex of the denominator:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle \frac{1 -3i }{ 2+i} 
&=& \displaystyle \frac{(1-3i)(2-i) }{ (2+i)(2-i) }\\ \\
&=&\displaystyle \frac{ 2 -i -6i-3 }{ 4+1} \\ \\
&=&\displaystyle  \frac{-1-7i }{ 5}\\ \\
& =&\displaystyle  -\frac{1}{ 5} - \frac{7}{5} i.\\ \\
\end{array}\]
