A major tool in elementary mathematics is the graphing of equations
in the 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/coord/",
"rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinate system")\}.  The interplay 
between algebra and geometry can be exploited to gain insights that would
otherwise be much harder to obtain.  Particularly important are 
equations whose graphs are
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight/",
"straight lines")\}.

$BR  
The line that passes through \((1,3)\) and has slope \(2\)
can be written in 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight/index.html#general",
"general form")\} as
$BR
\(y-\)\{ ans_rule(20) \} \(x\) -

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

 The 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/straight/index.html#pointslope",
"point slope formula")\} of a line of slope \(m\) through the point 
\((x_1,y_1)\) is
\[\frac{y-y_1 }{ x-x_1} =m. \]
In this case, \[\left(x_1,y_1\right) = (1,3) \qquad\hbox{and}\qquad  m=2.\]
Thus we obtain
\[\frac{y-3}{x-1 } = 2.\]
This can be rewritten in various ways, for example
\[y=2x+1 \quad\mbox{or}\quad y-2x-1 = 0.\]
