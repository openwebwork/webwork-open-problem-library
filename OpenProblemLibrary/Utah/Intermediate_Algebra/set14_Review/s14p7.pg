\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly/",
"Polynomials")\} are functions or expressions that can be evaluated in
a finite number of additions, multiplications, and
subtractions. However, they require no division for their evaluation.
(Fractions are considered constants in this context).  Polynomials
have a whole language associated with them that you need to
understand.  You also need to be able to manipulate polynomial
expressions to obtain their
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly/",
"standard form")\}.

$BR
Consider the polynomial 
\[p(x) = (x^2+1)(x-2)-3x-1.\]
$BR
Its 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly/",
"degree")\} is 
\{ ans_rule(3) \} and its 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly/index.html#terms",
"leading coefficient")\} is

\{ ans_rule(5) \}.  
$BR
In 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly/",
"standard form")\} it can be written as
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));

\(p(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \} \(x^3\)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

 To obtain the standard form we distribute and collect like
terms:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
p(x) &=& (x^2+1)(x-2)-3x-1 \\
&=& x^3 - 2x^2 +x -2 - 3x - 1 \\
&=& x^3 - 2x^2 -2x -3.\\
\end{array}
\]
The degree of \(p\) is \(3\) and its leading coefficient is 1.
