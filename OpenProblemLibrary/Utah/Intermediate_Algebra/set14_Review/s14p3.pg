Another major type of equation are
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/quadeq/",
"quadratic equations")\}.  As you go on in mathematics you will
solve many more quadratic equations.  You can use the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/formula/",
"quadratic formula")\} but it is hard to remember
reliably.  An alternative is the technique of 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/quadeq/index.html#complete"
,"completing the square")\}.
It is based on 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/binom/",
"the binomial formulas")\} which you should have used so often in this
class that you can't help remembering them.  If in fact you do not
remember them, look them up and do so many exercises involving them
that you won't be able to forget them if you tried.



$BR
Occasionally it is obvious how a
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/poly/index.html#terms","quadratic
expression or polynomial")\} can be
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/working/index.html#factoring","factored")\}
and if so you look for when the individual factors are zero.

The equation
\(x^2-4x-2=0\) has two real solutions.
Enter the smaller here 
\{ ans_rule(15) \}  and the larger here

ANS(num_cmp(2-sqrt(6)));

\{ ans_rule(15) \}
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2+sqrt(6)));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
This equation can be solved by the quadratic formula or by
completing the square.  Completing the square gives:

\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
x^2-4x-2 & = & 0            & \big|\quad + 6  \\
x^2-4x+4 & = & 6            & \big|\quad \hbox{perfect square} \\
(x-2)^2  & = & 6            & \big|\quad \sqrt{\quad~} \\
x-2      & = & \pm\sqrt{6}  & \big|\quad +2 \\
x        & = & 2\pm\sqrt{6} & \big|\quad \hbox{the solution}
\end{array}
