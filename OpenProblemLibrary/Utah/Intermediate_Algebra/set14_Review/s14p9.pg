Perhaps the most central concept in all of mathematics is that of
a
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/functions/index.html",
"function")\}.  You need to understand the concepts of 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/functions/index.html",
"rule")\}, 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/functions/index.html","domain")\}, and
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/functions/index.html",
"range")\}, and what it means to 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/functions/index.html",
"evaluate")\} a function at a number or an
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/algebra/index.html",
"algebraic expression")\} that may itself be defined by a function.


$BR

For this and the next two problems let
\[f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x^2-5x+6}.\]


Two numbers $BBOLD not $EBOLD in the domain of \(f\) are
\{ ans_rule(5) \} and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(5) \}.  (Enter the numbers in increasing size.)
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3));




SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

Of course we never divide by zero. The denominator is zero when
\(x=2\) or \(x=3\), and hence these two numbers are not in the domain
of \(f\).
