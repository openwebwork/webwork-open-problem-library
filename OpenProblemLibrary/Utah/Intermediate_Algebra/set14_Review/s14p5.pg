\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/quadeq/",
"Quadratic Equations")\} do not always occur in 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/quadeq/",
"standard form.")\}.  When they occur in disguise you apply the 
fundamental principle of equation solving:  $BR
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/principles/index.html#eqsolv",
"figure out what bothers you and get rid of it")\} 
by doing the same thing on both sides of the equation.   
$BR
If you understand and fully appreciate that principle
you have grasped more than half of Math 1010! 

$BR
Sometimes the process of converting an equation to a quadratic
equation introduces spurious solutions.  They solve the quadratic
equation but not the original equation.  That makes it doubly
important that you check your answers.  You check not just to make
sure you didn't make a mistake, but also to make sure you identify 
only the solutions of the original equation.

Even if you can guess the answer to the equation below, figure out how
to solve it properly anyway, and check the solutions for two
alternative approaches when the set closes. 

The equation
\[x+2\sqrt{x}-3=0\]
has the real solutions \(x=\)
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD


This equation can be converted into a quadratic equation by 
isolating the square root and then squaring.
Adding \(3\) and subtracting \(x\) on both sides gives:
\[2\sqrt{x} = 3-x.\]
Squaring on both sides gives
\[4x = 9 -6x+x^2\]
which is equivalent to 
\[x^2-10x+9 = 0.\]
Completing the square gives
\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
  x^2-10x+9            & = & 0   & \big|~~~ +16 \\
  x^2-10x+25 & = & 16  & \big|~~~  \mbox{perfect square} \\
  \left(x-5\right)^2 & = & 16   & \big|~~~  \sqrt{ ~ } \\
  x-5 & = & \pm4   &  \big|~~~ + 5 \\
  x & = & 5 \pm 4   & \big|~~~  \mbox{the solution}
\end{array}
\]

Thus \(x=1\) or \(x=9\).  Of these two numbers only \(x=1\) satisfies
the original equation.

$BR An alternative approach would be to introduce a new variable \(z=
\sqrt{x}\).  The original equation turns into \(z^2+2z-3=0\) which has
the solutions \(z=1\) and \(z=-3\).  For \(z=1\) the corresponding
value of \(x\) is \(x=1\), which is the solution of our original
equation.  \(z=-3\) does not give a solution \(x\) of the original
equation.
