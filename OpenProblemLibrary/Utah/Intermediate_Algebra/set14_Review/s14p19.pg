TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
There are some basic procedures for solving
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/words/",
"word problems")\} such as: use common sense, draw a picture, introduce
a variable, set up and solve an equation, have expectations, check
your answers.  Word problems are unpopular with students since they
add a layer of complexity, remember that you are studying mathematics
precisely because it enables you to solve word problems.



The length of a rectangle is \(4\) inches more than its width. Its
area is \(96\) square inches.  The length of the rectangle is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} inches and its

width is \{ ans_rule(10) \} inches.

ANS(num_cmp(8));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

Suppose the width of the rectangle is \(x\) inches.  Then its length equals
\(x+4\) inches.  The area equals
\[x(x+4)=96\]
square inches.  This is a quadratic equation
\[x^2+4x-96 = (x+12)(x-8) = 0 \]
which has the solutions \(x=8\) and \(x=-12\).  The negative solution
makes no sense for this problem.  Thus the rectangle  measures \(8\)
inches by \(12\) inches.
