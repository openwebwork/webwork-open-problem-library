TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

It takes you \(8\) hours to dig a hole.  It would take you and your
brother \(5\) hours to dig that same hole together. 
If your brother was to dig the hole by himself it would take him
\{ ans_rule(10) \} hours.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Let \(x\) be the number of hours it takes your brother to dig that
hole.  In one hour you dig \(\frac{1}{ 8} \) of that hole, your brother digs
\(\frac{1}{ x} \) of the hole, and the two of you together dig 
\(\frac{1}{ 5} \) of the hole.  Thus
\[\frac{1}{ 8} + \frac{1}{ x} = \frac{1}{ 5}.\]
Subtracting \(\frac{1}{8}\) on both sides gives
\[\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{40}.\]
Taking reciprocals on both sides of the equation gives the solution
\[x=\frac{40}{3}.\] Your brother by
himself takes \(13\) hours and \(20\) minutes.  Either he is a lot
younger than you are, or you need to work at motivating him better.

(This solution much improves an earlier version, and is due to
Brittany Dawn Crofts, a student in the Fall 2002 edition of this
class.)
