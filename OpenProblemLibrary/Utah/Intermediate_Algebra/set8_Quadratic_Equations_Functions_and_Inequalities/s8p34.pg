SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The area of a triangle equals one half times base times height.
Let's call the base of this particular triangle \(b\).  Then
its height equals \(b-8\).  Thus we have to solve the equation
\[\frac{b(b-8)}{2} = 192.\]
This is an ordinary quadratic equation that we can solve by completing the square:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
b^2-8b &=& 384\\
b^2-8b &=& 384\\
b^2 - 8b + 4^2 &=& 384 + 4^2 \\
\left(b-4\right)^2 &=& 400 \\
b-4 &=& \pm 20 \\
b &=& 4 \pm 20 \\
\end{array}
\]

Thus \(b=24\) or \(b=-16\).  The negative value does not make sense
here.  The base is 24 inches, and the height 8 inches less, i.e, 16
inches.
