You are on a pleasure cruise through the universe and you crash in the
ocean of an unknown planet.  Your spaceship floats on the water and
its top is $h feet above the surface of the water.  You swim away from
the spaceship until you see its top on the horizon.  Your laser range
meter tells you that your eyes are $d miles away from the top of the
space ship. (You are a capable - if reckless and curious - swimmer.)
The radius of the planet is \{ ans_rule(10) \} miles.

$BR
It's a small world, but it's all yours.  You figure that the surface
of the earth is  
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} times as large as the surface of your planet, but still, your
planet is plenty big enough for you (if only you can find land
somewhere).

$ratio = int(100*(3963/$r)**2+0.5)/100;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let \(r\) denote the radius of the planet, \(d\) the distance
between your eyes and the top of your ship, and \(h\) the height of your
ship above the water.  Consider the right triangle formed by your
eyes, the top of your space ship, and the center of that planet.  Its
sides have length \(r\), \(r+h\), and \(d\).  Thus, by the Pythagorean
Theorem, \[(r+h)^2 = d^2+ r^2.\] We know \(d\) and \(h\), and we
want to compute \(r\).  So we solve this equation for \(r\): 
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
(r+h)^2 &=& d^2+ r^2 \\
r^2 + 2rh + h^2 &=& d^2+r^2 \\
2rh + h^2 &=& d^2 \\
 2rh &=& d^2 -h^2\\ 
 r &=& \frac{d^2-h^2}{2h}
\end{array}
\] 
On your particular planet, measuring
everything in miles, we obtain \[r = \frac{$d^2 - \left(\frac{$h}{5280}
\right)^2} {2 \times \frac{$h}{5280} } \approx
$rint~\mbox{miles.}\] 

As given in problem 8 of set 8, the radius of Earth is 3,963 miles.
The ratio of the areas of the two planets equals the square of the corresponding ratio of the radii, which in this case works out to 
approximately $ratio.

$BR

You can of course compute the latter ratio by computing the area of
the earth and that of your private planet, and then taking the ratio.  The
area of a sphere of radius \(r\) equals \(4\pi r^2\), or exactly 4
times the area of a circle of radius \(r\).  That's a stunning result,
if you think about it.  It was discovered by Archimedes about 2,200
years ago!
