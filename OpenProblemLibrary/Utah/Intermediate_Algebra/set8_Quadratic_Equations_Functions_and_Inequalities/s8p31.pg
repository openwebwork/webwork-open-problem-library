TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The equation
\[x-\sqrt{x}-2=0\]
has the solution 
$BR\(x=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(4));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: Begin by thinking of \(\sqrt{x}\) as the unknown.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Letting
\[z=\sqrt{x}\] 
our equation turns into
\[z^2-z-2 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation that has the solutions 
\(z=2\) and \(z=-1\).  We know that \[x=z^2\].  Thus \(x\) may be
\(1\) or \(4\), but only \(x=4\) solves the original equation.
