The equation \[\frac{x-1}{2x+1} = \frac{x+1}{x-1} \]
has two real solutions.
Enter the

"smaller")\} one here \{ ans_rule(10) \} and

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We begin by multiplying with \((2x+1)\)  and \((x-1)\) on both sides:
\[
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\frac{x-1}{2x+1} &=& \frac{x+1}{x-1} &|& \times(x-1)\times(2x+1) \\
(x-1)^2 &=& (x+1)(2x+1) &|& \hbox{expand} \\
x^2-2x+1 &=& 2x^2+3x+1 &|& -x^2+2x+1,\quad\hbox{switch sides} \\
x^2+5x &=& 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

Thus we obtain a quadratic equation that we can solve by completing
the square or using the quadratic formula.  However, in this case it
is much simpler to rewrite the equation as \[x(x+5) = 0 \] which makes
it clear that the solutions are \(x=0\) and \(x=-5\).  Note that
the larger of these two solutions is \(x=0\) and not \(x=-5\).
