There are two solutions of the equation \[bx^2 -cx + a^2 = 0 \] (where
\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(x\) is the unknown).  They
differ by the sign of the square root. Enter the one with the plus sign
here $BR \{ans_rule(80)\}.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The quadratic formula says that the solution of the equation
\[ax^2+bx+c = 0 \] is given by
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\]
The equation given in this problem also uses \(a\), \(b\) and \(x\),
but in a different way.  We need to translate from the standard
equation to th particular equation.  Thus, in the quadratic formula
we need to replace \(a\) with \(b\), \(b\) with \(-c\), and \(c\) with
\(a^2\).
Carrying out this plan gives
\[ x = \frac{c \pm \sqrt{c^2-4a^2b}}{2b}.\]
This can be entered into WeBWorK 
for example as 
\[\hbox {(c+sqrt(c\^{}2-4*a\^{}2*b))/(2*b)}\]
Note the parentheses around numerator, the denominator, and
the expression under the square root.
