SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's think of \(x^2\) as the variable and call it \(z\).  Then our
equation turns into  
\[z^2-10z+9 =0.\]
This a quadratic equation whose solutions are \(z=1\) and \(z=9\).
Since \[z=x^2\]
we have that \(x=\pm 1 \) and \(x=\pm 3\).   We need to enter these 
solutions in the proper order:
\[-3, \quad -1, \quad 1, \quad 3.\]
