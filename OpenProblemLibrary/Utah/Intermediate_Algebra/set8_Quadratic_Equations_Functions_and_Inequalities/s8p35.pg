TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
The height of a triangle is 25 inches greater than
its base.  The area of the triangle is 625 square inches.  The height
of the triangle is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} inches
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(50));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and the base of the triangle is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} inches.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(25));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:  The area of a triangle equals one half of base
times height. 
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
This problem is much like the preceding one.  We solve
\[\frac{b(b+25)}{2} = 625 \]
to obtain 
\(b=25.\)  Hence the height is 50 inches.
