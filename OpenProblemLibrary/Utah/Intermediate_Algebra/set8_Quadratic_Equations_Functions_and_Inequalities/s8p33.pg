This problem is similar to the preceding one.

There are two solutions of the equation \[bx^2 +bx + a^2 = 0 \] (where
\(a\) and \(b\) are constants, and \(x\) is the unknown).  They
differ by the sign of the square root. Enter the one with the plus sign
here $BR \{ans_rule(80)\}.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The quadratic formula says that the solution of the equation
\[ax^2+bx+c = 0 \] is given by
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\]
The equation given in this problem also uses \(a\), \(b\) and \(x\),
but in a different way.  We need to translate from the standard
equation to th particular equation.  Thus, in the quadratic formula
we need to replace \(a\) with \(b\) and \(c\) with \(a^2\).
Carrying out this plan gives
\[x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4a^2b}}{2b}.\]
