SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD This is a little more subtle than the
preceding problems.  Our general principle applies, however.  In this
case, we are bothered by the fact that the unknown occurs in the
denominators.  To get rid of the denominators we multiply with both
denominators on both sides:
\[\frac{x(x-$a)(x+$b)}{x-$a} = \frac{(x-$c)(x-$a)(x+$b)}{x+$b} \]
Canceling the common factors in numerators and denominators gives:
\[x(x+$b) = (x-$c)(x-$a) \]
which is like some of our preceding questions.
