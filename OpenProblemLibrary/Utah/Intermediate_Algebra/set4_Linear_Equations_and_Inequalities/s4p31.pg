Here is the other problem from "The Story of Civilization":

$BR Eight rubies, ten emeralds, and a hundred pearls, which are in thy
ear-ring, my beloved, were purchased by me for thee at an equal
amount; and the sum of the prices of the three sort of gems was three
less than half a hundred; tell me the price of each, auspicious woman.
$BR Enter the price of one pearl  \{ ans_rule(10) \}, the 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
price of one emerald  \{ ans_rule(10) \}, and the 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(20));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
the price of one ruby  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(25));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: I had to ponder this a bit.  The word "equal"
means that eight rubies cost as much as ten emeralds or a hundred
pearls.  The prices that add to "three less than half a hundred" are
the prices for one pearl, or one emerald, or one ruby. If you knew
the price of a pearl you could easily figure out the price of a ruby
or an emerald, just try some suitable numbers for the price of a
pearl.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Three less than half a hundred is 47, of
course.  I first assumed the price of a pearl to be 1 rupee, that
didn't work.  However, if a pearl costs 2 rupees, then for 200 rupees
you can buy eight rubies at 25 rupees each and 10 emeralds at 20
rupees each. Since  \(2+20+25 =47\) this is the correct solution.

Maybe this is how the Hindus solved this problem.
One can also approach it in  a more modern fashion by setting up and solving a
linear equation.  Let \(x\) be the price of a pearl.  Then the price of 
a ruby is 12.5 \(x\), and the price of an emerald is 10\(x\).  We 
need to have
\[x + 10x + 12.5 x = 23.5x = 47.\]
Hence \(x=2\).
