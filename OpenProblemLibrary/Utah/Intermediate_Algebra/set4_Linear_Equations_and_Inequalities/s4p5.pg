TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR You are probably used to solving problems where the coefficients
are specific numbers.  However, in many problems the coefficients are
variables themselves, and the answer depends on those variables.  As
you go on in mathematics, the role of specific numbers will keep
decreasing, and the role of general coefficients (or parameters) will
increase.   The next couple of problems are our first foray into this
new area.

$BR The solution of the equation \( a x + b = c \) 
$BR is \(x = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}.  
$BR (Your answer will of course be in terms of
\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). You may assume that \(a\) is non-zero.)

ANS(fun_cmp("(c-b)/a", limits=>[[1,2],[1,2],[3,4]], vars=>["a","b","c"]));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We follow the principle of getting rid what bothers us by doing the
same thing on both sides of the equation.  \(x\) is not by itself. So
we subtract \(b\) on both sides to obtain
\[ax = c-b. \]
\(x\) is still not by itself, so we divide by \(a\) on both sides.
This is getting a subtle, however.  We must divide all of the right
hand side by \(a\), which gives us \((c-b)/a\).  Not the parentheses!  
The situation is clearer if we use fraction bars:
\[x = \frac{c-b}{a}.\]  Note how the assumption that \(a\) is non-zero
enters this calculation.  We must never divide by zero, and our
assumption makes sure than we don't.
