TEXT(beginproblem());

$diff =  random(5000,25000,1000);

$BR
Suppose the next time
you buy a house including the land it sits on for $sum Dollars.
The real estate agent tells you that the land costs $diff more than the house.

$BR 

You apply your formula derived in the previous problem.
To do so you set
\(S =\) \{ ans_rule(10) \} dollars
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($sum));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and 
\(D = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} dollars.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($diff));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR and you find out that 
the price of the house is 
\{ ans_rule(20) \} dollars
EOT
$answer = ($sum-$diff)/2;$H=$answer;
ANS(num_cmp($answer));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and the price of the land is 
\{ ans_rule(20) \} dollars.
EOT
$answer = ($sum+$diff)/2;$L=$answer;
ANS(num_cmp($answer));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We simply substitute the values of
\(S= $sum\) and \(D = $diff\) in the formulas
from the preceding problem and obtain
\(H= $H\) and \(L =  $L\) in the formulas
