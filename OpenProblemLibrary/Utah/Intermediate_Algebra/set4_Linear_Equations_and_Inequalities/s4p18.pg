TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Indicate with T (true) if the equations below are equivalent to a linear equation
and with an F (False) if not.  For example, the equation
\[x^2+3x+4 = x^2+5 \]
turns into  the linear equation
\[3x+4 = 5 \]
after subtracting \(x^2\) on both sides.
$BR 
Actually, the issue of whether a given equation is equivalent to a
linear equation is quite subtle, but for the problems given here the
answer will be (hopefully) obvious.  To help you along, in this
problem WeBWorK will indicate for each answer separately whether it's
right or wrong and so you can get credit by just trying T's and F's.
Of course you should think about the questions carefully and figure
out why the answer is T or F.  This will enable you to approach other questions more effectively.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The equation  \(x^2+ 3x + 4 = 17x-5 + x^2\)  is linear after
subtracting \(x^2\) on both sides.  The equation \( \frac{1}{x+1} =
\frac{1}{2x-1}\)
is linear after taking the reciprocals on both sides. The equation
 \(\frac{x}{6} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{6} \) is actually a linear
equation in standard form.  The  coefficients are fractions that might
deceive you into thinking the equation is non-linear.  The equation
 \(x^2-4x -2 = 6x-14 - x^2\) is non-linear.  There is no obvious
way to get rid of the term \(x^2\), but of course there might be a
non-obvious way.  However, there are two solutions of this equation,
namely \(x=2\) and \(x=3\) and no linear equation has 2 solutions.
