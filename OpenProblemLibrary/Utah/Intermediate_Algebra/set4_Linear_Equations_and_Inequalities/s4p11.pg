$BR
The solution of the equation
\[ \frac{1}{x-$a} = \frac{1}{2x+$b} \]
$BR
is \(x = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
EOT

$answer = -$a-$b;



ANS(num_cmp($answer));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: Take reciprocals on both sides.
EOT



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We start by taking the reciprocal on both sides
of the equation.  This gives the equivalent equation
\[x-$a = 2x + $b.\]
Subtracting \(x\) and \(b\) on both sides gives
\($answer = x. \)
