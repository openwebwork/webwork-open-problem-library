The last two problems are examples of "simple Hindu Algebra", quoted
on page 528 of "The Story of Civilization", v.1., by Will Durant,
Simon and Schuster, 1935.  The problems are approximately 1,800 years
old.  (Mental pursuits by women were discouraged at that time. You
ponder the significance of fictitiously directing the questions at
women.  Durant does not comment on this issue.)



$BR Out of a swarm of bees one fifth part settled on a Kadamba
blossom; one third on a Silihindra flower; three times the difference
of those numbers flew to the bloom of a Kutaja.  One bee, which
remained, hovered about in the air.  Tell me, charming woman, the
number of bees  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.

$BR Hint: Call the number of bees \(x\) and convert the
story into an equation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(x\) be the number of bees. Then the
story tells us that \[x-\frac{x}{5} -\frac{x}{3} -
3\left(\frac{x}{3}-\frac{x}{5}\right) = 1.\] Applying the Distributive
Law and combining the fractions gives \[\left(1-\frac{1}{5} -\frac{1}{3} -3
\left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{5}\right)\right)x = \frac{15-3-5-3(5-3)}{15}x =
\frac{1}{15} x = 1.\] Thus there are 15 bees.  Note that when the
problem refers to "the difference of these two numbers" we need to
subtract one fifth from one third, since otherwise the number of bees
on the bloom of a Kutaja would be negative.
