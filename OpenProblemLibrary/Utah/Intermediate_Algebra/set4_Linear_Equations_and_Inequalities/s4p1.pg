$BR
The solution of the equation
\( $a x = $b \)
$BR
is \(x = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$BR
You may enter your answer as a decimal number or as a fraction. I
recommend that in problems like this you use fractions rather than
decimal approximations.  You don't have to figure out your
approximation, and you don't have to worry about just how accurately
you should approximate the answer.
