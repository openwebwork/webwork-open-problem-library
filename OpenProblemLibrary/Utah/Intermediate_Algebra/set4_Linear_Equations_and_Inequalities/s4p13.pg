$BR
The solution of the equation
\[ \frac{1}{x^2-$a x + $c } = \frac{1}{x^2 - $b x + $c}\]
$BR
is \(x = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.

$BR Hint: Take reciprocals on both sides.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Again  we start by taking the reciprocal on
both sides of the equation.  This gives the equivalent equation 
\[ {x^2-$a x + $c } = {x^2 - $b x + $c}\]
which can be solved as before.
