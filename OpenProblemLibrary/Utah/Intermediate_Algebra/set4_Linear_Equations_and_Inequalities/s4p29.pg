$BR The next time you buy a house including the land  for
$sum Dollars.  This time the real estate agent tells you that the land costs
$diff Dollars $BBOLD less $EBOLD than the house.
 
$BR 
You realize that you can still apply your formula.
You set
\(S =\) \{ ans_rule(10) \} dollars

and 
\(D = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} dollars.

$BR and you find out that 
the price of the house is 
\{ ans_rule(20) \} dollars

and the price of the land is

$answer = ($sum-$diff)/2;

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
You consider your recent purchase a great deal, you
realize that you just developed a mathematical theory of buying
combinations and figuring individual prices in terms of sums and
differences, you recognize that math is a useful subject,
and you sit back in your new house, feeling well pleased with
yourself, and marveling at the 
unreasonable power of mathematics!
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Mathematically the fact that now the house
costs more than land just means that difference is negative.
Everything else is the same as before.
