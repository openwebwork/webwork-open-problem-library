TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose your average percentage on these WeBWorK homeworks is \(p\)
percent.  You wish to obtain a grade in this class that requires you
to obtain at least \(q\) percent overall.  Enter here \{ ans_rule(20)
\} the minimum average percentage your need to obtain on the exams.
Your answer should of course depend on \(p\) and \(q\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR 

$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As before think of the percent you obtain overall in this course as
$BITALIC points$EITALIC.  You wish to obtain \(q\) points.
Your WeBWorK problems account for $wwp points, and you obtain
\($wwp\times \frac{p}{100}\) of them.  The exams can give you up to $r points.
Let \(x\) be our unknown percentage on the exams.  Then
\[$wwp \times \frac{p}{100} + $r \times \frac{x}{100}  = q.\]
To solve this equation start by multiplying with 100 on both sides.
The result is
\[x = \frac{100 q - $wwp p}{$r}.\]
