$BR
You can paint a certain room in $a hours.  Your brother can do it in
$b hours.  How long does it take the two of you working together? 

$BR \{ ans_rule(10) \} hours.
EOT
$answer = $a*$b/($a+$b);
ANS(num_cmp($answer));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
Call \(x\) the number of hours it will take the two of you.  Think
about how much of the room you and your brother each can paint in one
hour. 
EOT


$num = $a*$b;
$den = $a+$b;
$nn = $num; $dd = $den;

if ($num < 0) { $nn = -$nn;}

if ($nn < $dd ) { $dummy = $nn; $nn = $dd; $dd = $dummy;}

while ( ( $nn % $dd) != 0) 
   {$dummy = $nn % $dd; $nn = $dd; $dd = $dummy;}

$num = $num/$dd;
$den = $den/$dd;




SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
In one hour you can paint \(\frac{1}{$a}\) of the room, and your
brother can paint \(\frac{1}{$b}\) of the room.  In \(x\) hours the
two of you can paint \(\frac{x}{$a} + \frac{x}{$b}\) of the room.  
You want to paint the whole room, so
\[\frac{x}{$a} + \frac{x}{$b} = 1.\]
Solving this equation gives the answer
\[x=\frac{$num}{$den}\hbox{~hours}.\]
