$BR
You figure that you will buy property many times and you 
endeavor to work out a formula that will tell you the price of 
the land and the price of the buildings any time.

$BR 
So suppose the price for the land and buildings combined is \(S\) (for "sum")
and the land costs \(D\) (for "difference") more than the buildings.


$BR 

Then the price of the buildings is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} dollars
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(S-D)/2", vars=>["S","D"]));

and the price of the land is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} dollars.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(S+D)/2", vars=>["S","D"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Remember that in mathematics upper and lower case letters are distinct.
So make sure that in your formulas you use  upper case letters \(S\) and \(D\),
rather than lower case letters!

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let the price of the
house be \(H\).  Then the price of the land is \(H+ D\) and we have
the equation \[H + (H+D) = S\] which can be rewritten (after
subtracting \(D\) on both sides) as \[S-D = 2H.\]
Thus
\[H=\frac{S-D}{2} \]
and the price of the land is
\[L = H + D = \frac{S-D}{2}+D = \frac{S-D+2D}{2} = \frac{S+D}{2}\]
