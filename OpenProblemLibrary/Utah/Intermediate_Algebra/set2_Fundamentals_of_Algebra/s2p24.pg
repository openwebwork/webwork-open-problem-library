TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you obtain 100 percent credit on all WeBWorK assignments in
this class.  Then the minimum average percentage on the exams
(including the final exam) that will still get you an A in this class
is \{ ans_rule(20) \} percent.  Your answer should be an integer
between 0 and 100.  Compute the percentage to 1 or 2 digits beyond the
decimal point, and then round it to the smallest integer that's no
less than your computed percentage.  The information you need to
answer this question is given
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/1010/sched.pdf", "in your
Syllabus.")\}

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
HINT: The confusing part of this problem is that "percent"
means different things, the overall percentage you get in this course,
and the percentage you get on each of the various assignments.  Think
of the percent you need to get in the course as "points".

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The WeBWorK homeworks account for $ww percent of
your grade, and you need to get $A percent overall to obtain an A.
Think of the percent you need to get in the course as "points".  The
perfect WeBWorK homeworks account for $ww of those $A points, and so
you need $need points more.  The exams account for \(100-$ww=$ex\) points,
and $need is \(\frac{$need}{$ex} \times 100 = \frac{$needb}{$ex} \approx $ans\)
percent of $ex.  On average you need to get $ans% on each test.
