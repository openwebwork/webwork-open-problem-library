TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The $BBOLD proper divisors $EBOLD of a natural number \(n\) are those factors
of \(n\) that are less than \(n\).  For example, the proper divisors
of 10 are 1, 2, and 5.  If the sum of the proper divisors of \(n\) is
larger than \(n\) then \(n\) is said to be $BBOLD abundant $EBOLD .  If the 
sum
is less than \(n\) then \(n\) is $BBOLD deficient $EBOLD .  If the sum 
$BITALIC
equals $EITALIC \(n\), then \(n\) is $BBOLD perfect $EBOLD .

$BR

For example, the proper divisors of 10 add to 1+2+5=8 and so 10
is deficient.  The proper divisors of 12 add to 1+2+3+4+6 = 16, and so
12 is abundant.  The proper divisors of 6 add to 1+2+3 = 6, and so 
6 is perfect.

$BR Perfect numbers have been studied for more than 2,000 years.  It
is still unknown how many perfect numbers exist.  At present only 39
are known and the largest of them has 18,669,112 digits.

ANS(num_cmp(28, mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The next largest perfect number is 28.  Its divisors are
1, 2, 4, 7, and 14, which add to 28.  (The next largest perfect number
is 496.)
