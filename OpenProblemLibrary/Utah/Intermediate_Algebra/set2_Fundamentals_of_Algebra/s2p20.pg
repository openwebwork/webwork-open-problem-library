The last few problems on this set deal with simple percentage 
problems.
$BR
You make $DOLLAR $a a year, and you get a 10% raise. Your new 
salary is $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  (Salaries in these problems are 
randomly chosen and range from $DOLLAR 20,000 to $DOLLAR 100,000.)
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1.1*$a));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR The next year you get a 10% cut.  Your new salary is
$DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(0.99*$a));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
That is \{ ans_rule(5) \}% less than your initial salary.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));
