$BR You and your coworker together make $DOLLAR 16
per hour.  You know your coworker earns 10 percent more than you do.
Your hourly wage is $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(10) \}.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR After taking Math 1010 your hourly wage is
raised to $DOLLAR 12.  This is a raise of \{ ans_rule(10) \}%.
EOT

$b = (1200/$a - 100); ANS(num_cmp($b));

$BR After returning to work you can't help
mentioning casually to your coworker that now you make \{ ans_rule(10)
\}% more than he does.

since now you can figure problems like the ones on this assignment!

$BR HINT: The confusing part here is that the various percentages apply 
to
different base amounts.  Think carefully about what the base amount is
in each case.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Suppose you make \(x\) dollars per hour.  Your coworker makes 10
percent more.  Thus his wage is \(1.1 x\) dollars per hour.  Together
the two of you make \[2.1x = 16 \] dollars.  Thus \(x=\frac{16}{2.1} =
$DOLLAR 7.62\) per hour.  After you take Math 1010 your wage is raised
by $DOLLAR 4.38 to $DOLLAR 12.- per hour.  $DOLLAR 4.38 is
\[\frac{4.38\times 100 }{7.62} = 57.5\] percent of $DOLLAR 7.62.
Quite a nice raise!  Your coworker still makes \[$DOLLAR 16 - $DOLLAR
7.62 = $DOLLAR 8.38\] per hour.  So now you make \[$DOLLAR 12 - $DOLLAR
8.38 = $DOLLAR 3.62 \] per hour more than he does.  $DOLLAR 3.62 is
\[\frac{3.62\times 100}{8.38} = 43.2\] percent of $DOLLAR 8.38.  You
make 43.2% more than your coworker.  As he says, your higher pay is
well deserved!
