TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The purpose of this last and lengthy problem is to help you $BBOLD
prepare for the first exam. $EBOLD  



There will be ten questions, all questions have equal weight, and
you'll be able to use only pen or pencil and the exam itself,
i.e., $BBOLD no notes, books, or calculators! $EBOLD  
To avoid distraction 
and disruption I will
not be able to answer questions during the exam.


Before the exam, read the guidelines for exams on your syllabus.

 Work through the list below and make sure you understand the
described items and can answer questions related to them.





$BR

$BR $BBOLD
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/fractions/",
"Fractions.")\} $EBOLD  You need to be able to add, multiply, subtract, and
divide fractions.  Moreover, you need to be able to recognize 
common factors in numerator and denominator, and cancel them.  
It does not hurt to practice, so here we go:
$BR
\(\frac{2}{7} + \frac{4}{21} = \)  \{ ans_rule(5) \} \(/\)
  \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$BR
\(\frac{2}{7} - \frac{4}{21} = \)  \{ ans_rule(5) \} \(/\)
  \{ ans_rule(5) \}.

$BR
\(\frac{2}{7} \times \frac{4}{21} = \)  \{ ans_rule(5) \} \(/\)
  \{ ans_rule(5) \}.

$BR
\(\frac{2}{7} \div \frac{4}{21} = \)  \{ ans_rule(5) \} \(/\)
  \{ ans_rule(5) \}.


Here is a more complicated fraction problem:

\(\frac{\frac{4}{3}- \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{2}{5}+ \frac{1}{3}} = \)
\{ ans_rule(5) \} \(/\)
  \{ ans_rule(5) \}.






$BR $BBOLD
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/precedence/",
"Language.")\} $EBOLD Understand the language related to the four basic
arithmetic operations.  $BBOLD Don't $EBOLD use embarrassingly juvenile words
like "timesing" and "minussing".  Use the proper terms
"multiplying" and "subtracting".  Understand the words add, multiply,
subtract, divide, sum, difference, product, quotient, factor,
multiple, divisor, dividend.  Also understand and know the names of
the rules of arithmetic: the commutative and associative laws of
addition and multiplication, and the distributive law.  Use the
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/glossary/",
"Glossary")\} and have someone quiz you if you are not sure.  Know
what kind of
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/numbers/",
"numbers")\} (natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real
numbers) there are.



$BR $BBOLD 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/dislaw/",
"The Distributive Law.")\} $EBOLD  Understand how to apply the Distributive
Law to simplify algebraic expressions. 

$BR $BBOLD
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/precedence/",
"Precedence.")\} $EBOLD Understand the conventions of arithmetic precedence.
There are a large number of problems like this on set 1.
Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.  If
there are several operations of the same level of precedence we work
from left to right.  However, anything in parentheses is evaluated
first. Addition and subtraction have the same level of precedence, and
so do multiplication and division.  You can also use superfluous
parentheses to make your meaning clear if you are not sure.

$BR Know how to compute $BBOLD
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/line/index.html#absolute",
"absolute values.")\} $EBOLD of arithmetic expressions. 


$BR There is a word problem on the set.  It's about buying a car,
and I realize that you may never have bought a car.  The problem also
contains some words you may not have seen before, like "invoice price"
(which is the dollar amount the dealer is charged by the manufacturer)
and "factory incentive" (which is a rebate given by the manufacturer
to the dealer).  However, the problem can be solved just using common
sense and understanding
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/percent/", "the
language of percent.")\} 

$BR
Here is another percent problem:
You buy a used car listed as $DOLLAR 10,000 at a discount of 10 percent.
However, you also pay 10 percent sales tax.  Thus you end up writing a
check for $DOLLAR
 \{ ans_rule(6) \}.
