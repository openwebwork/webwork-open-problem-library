TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider the system of equations
\[
\begin{array}{rcrccl}
3x&+&2y&=&1\\
2x&-&3y&=&2\\
\end{array}
\]
Its solution is
$BR
\(x=\)\{ ans_rule(6) \} and

ANS(num_cmp("7/13"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\(y=\)\{ ans_rule(6) \}.  (I would enter my answers as fractions.)
EOT
ANS(num_cmp("-4/13"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
Even though this is a simple problem, use the 
general method for solving linear systems.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

This is a little more complicated.  To obtain an equation 
with only one variable we can for example multiply the first equations with 3 and add twice the second equation.
This gives the table:

\[
\begin{array}{lrrrr}
\hbox{equation}&x&y&\hbox{RHS}&\hbox{RS}\\ \\
{[1]}&3&2&1&6\\
{[2]}&2&-3&2&1\\
{[3]=3[1]+2[2]}&13&0&7&20\\
\end{array}
\]
The last row of this table means that \(13x=7\) or \(x=\frac{7}{13}\).
Substituting \(x\) in the second equation gives
\[\frac{14}{13}-3y = 2\]
or 
\[3y= \frac{14}{13} -2 = -\frac{12}{13}.\]
Hence \[y=-\frac{4}{13}.\] 

$BR

You might say that the above approach was a little contrived.  Who
would come up with the idea of multiplying one row with \(2\), another
with \(3\), and then computing the sum?  Actually, it's a little more
systematic than that.  You settle on a variable that you wish to
eliminate.  Let's say it's \(y\).  (You could pick \(x\), and which
variable you pick in general is mostly determined by convenience.)  We
will get rid of \(y\) by subtracting two equations if we have two
equations that have the same coefficient for \(y\), or by adding two
equations where one coefficient of \(y\) is the negative of the
other. To get there we multiply the two equations with appropriate
factors so that the common coefficient of \(y\) is a common multiple
of the original two coefficients.  We could also, for example, divide
the first equation by \(2\), to make the coefficient of \(y\) equal to
\(1\), and then add \(3\) times that equation to the second to get rid
of \(y\).  This would require fractional arithmetic, and usually it's
easier to avoid fractions until the end. Try out these ideas on this
simple example, since you'll be able to apply them to larger systems
on the next homework.
