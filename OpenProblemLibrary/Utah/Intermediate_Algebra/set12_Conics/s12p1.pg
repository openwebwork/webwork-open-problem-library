Indicate whether the following equations define a straight line (L), a
circle (C), an ellipse (but not a circle) (E), a parabola (P), or a
hyperbola (H).  Remember that WeBWorK is case sensitive, so you must
enter capital letters L, C, E, P, H for your answer to be recognized.
To get you going, on this and the next problem WeBWorK will tell you
about each individual answer whether it is correct, but make sure you
understand what you are doing so that you are prepared for the next
problems.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
$BR
$BR \(3x+4y+5=0\) is a general equation defining a straight line.
Its slope-intercept form is \(y=-\frac{5}{4} -\frac{3}{4}x\).
$BR \((x-1)^2+(y-3)^2=4 \)  defines a circle of radius \(\sqrt{4}=2\)
with the center being the point \((1,3)\).
$BR \(y = -3(x-1)^2 + 4\) defines a parabola that opens down and 
has the vertex \((1,4)\).
$BR \(x^2-y^2=1\) defines a hyperbola.   
$BR \(x^2+\frac{y^2}{2}=1\) defines an ellipse centered at the origin.
Its major axis is vertical and has length \(2\), its minor axis is horizontal 
and has length \(2\sqrt{2}\).
