TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You take a group of 20 people going to the movies.
Kids' tickets cost $DOLLAR 4.- each, and adults tickets $DOLLAR 6.- each.
Your total cost is $DOLLAR 96.- .  The number of kids in your group is
$BR
\{ ans_rule(6) \} 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp("12"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let \(x\) denote the number of kids and \(y\) the number of adults.  
We obtain the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
x&+y&=&20\\
4x&+6y&=&96\\
\end{array}
\]

Solving it shows that there are \(8\) adults and \(12\) kids in your group.
