In this problem you may have to convert the equations
to standard form first before recognizing what kind of graph they
have.  Indicate whether the following equations define a straight line
(L), a circle (C), an ellipse (but not a circle) (E), a parabola (P),
or a hyperbola (H).

If you don't recognize the type of equation right away convert it to
standard form by completing the square.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR
$BR \(3x+4y=5\) defines a straight line whose general equation is 
\(3x+4y-5=0\).
$BR \(x^2+4x+y^2+6y+9=0 \) must define a circle since \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) have the same factor.  Completing the square in \(x\) and \(y\) gives
the equivalent equation \((x+2)^2 +(y+3)^2 = 4\).  Thus the center of the circle is the point \((-2,-3)\) and its radius is \(2\).
$BR \(y = 2x^2-3x+4 \) defines a parabola since there is no square in \(y\).
Moreover, since the coefficient multiplying \(x^2\) is positive the parabola opens upward.
Factoring out \(2\) and completing the square gives
the equivalent equation
\(y=2\left(x-\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 + \frac{23}{8}\).  Hence the vertex
of the parabola is \(\left(\frac{3}{4},\frac{23}{8}\right)\).
$BR  \(x^2+4x-y^2-6y+9=0 \) defines a hyperbola since the coefficients
of \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) have opposite signs. 
$BR \(2x^2+y^2-1=0\) is almost the standard form of an equation
defining an ellipse.  Adding \(1\) on both sides gives
\(2x^2 + y^2 = \frac{x^2}{1/2} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1.\)
The ellipse is centered at the origin.  Its major axis is vertical
and has length 2, its minor axis is horizontal and has length 
\(2\times \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}.\)
