TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Your friend has  a cube of gold.  
You have a cube of gold that  weighs twice as much.  Your
cube is \{ ans_rule(10) \} as long as your friends,
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2**(1/3)));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and it has \{ ans_rule(10) \} times the surface area. You can imagine
how this would work with a spherical diamond, so we won't repeat that
part here.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2**(2/3)));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Here is another question:
The ratio of the weight of your cube and the surface area of your cube is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} times as large as the corresponding ratio of your friend's cube.

ANS(num_cmp(2**(1/3)));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
This is much like the preceding problem, except that since the volume
is doubled the length of the larger cube is obtained by multiplying
that of the smaller cube with \(2^{\frac{1}{3}} \approx 1.26.\) The
ratio of volume (or weight) to area is multiplied by the same factor.
