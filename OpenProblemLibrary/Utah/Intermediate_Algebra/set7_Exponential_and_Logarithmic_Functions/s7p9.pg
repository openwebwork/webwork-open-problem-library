Find two

"natural numbers")\} \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b > a \) and
\[a^b = b^a.\]

Then \(a = \)  \{ ans_rule(4) \}

$BR Hint:  It is not usually true that \(a^b = b^a\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Since \(a\) and
\(b\) are natural numbers it takes only a short
time to find the answer by trial and error: \(2^4 = 4^2\).
It's a little tricky to show that there are no other natural numbers \(a\)
and \(b\) that satisfy \(a^b = b^a\).  There are. however, infinitely
many pairs of $BBOLD real numbers$EBOLD satisfying that equation.
