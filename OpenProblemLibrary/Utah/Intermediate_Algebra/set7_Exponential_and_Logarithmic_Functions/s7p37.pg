TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The effects of scaling, explored in the previous two problems for
cubes and spheres, also apply to odd shaped objects.  Just think of
them as composed of many small cubes and ask what happens to the cubes
as you change their lengths.

In the novel $BITALIC Gulliver's travels $EITALIC by Jonathan Swift, 
Gulliver
visits a country, $BITALIC Brobdingnag $EITALIC , in which everything, 
including
people, plants, buildings, etc., is 12 times as large as in England.
(In that same novel Gulliver visits several other strange countries,
and in a conversation with the King of Brobdingnag casually refers to
the future United States as "our plantations in America".)  Suppose
Gulliver encounters a giant who is shaped exactly like Gulliver,
except he is twelve times as tall.  Then the weight of that giant is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of Gulliver.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(12**3));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The area of the cross section of one of the giant's bones is 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of Gulliver's corresponding bone.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(12**2));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Hence the ratio of the giant's weight and the area of his bone's cross
section is \{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of Gulliver's corresponding
ratio.  What do you think would happen to the giant?


EOT
ANS(num_cmp(12));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Those giants would weigh \(12^3=1728\) times as much as ordinary
human beings, but the cross section of their bones would be multiplied
only with \(12^2=144\).  As a result the giants would be sprawling on
the ground unable to move.  They would also suffocate because their need
of oxygen is multiplied with 1728 but the inner surface of their lungs
is multiplied only with 144.  If they could overcome those obstacles
they would have to spend twelve times as much time as human beings
ingesting food since their need for food is increased by a factor
1728, but the cross section of their esophagus, which determines their
capacity to ingest food, only by 144.  If they could manage that they
would still develop 1728 times as much heat, but they could shed it
only through a surface that is 144 times as large as ours.
So if they somehow did come to exist they would develop a
fever and soon die.

Remarkably, this simple and compelling piece of mathematics and common
sense did not stop Jonathan Swift from writing an entertaining and quite
famous story!
