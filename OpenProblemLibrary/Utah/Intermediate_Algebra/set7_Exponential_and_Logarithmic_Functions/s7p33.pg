TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
It takes you 1 gallon of paint to paint the inside of a box.  The next
day you paint a box that has the same ratios of length to width and
length to height, but it takes you 2 gallons to paint the box.  You
conclude that the total inside area of the larger box is twice that of
the smaller box.  You conclude that the volume of the larger box
equals \{ ans_rule(10) \} times that of the smaller box.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The bigger box has twice the area of the smaller box, so its
linear dimensions are those of the smaller box multiplied with the
square root of 2.  The volume increases as the cube of any factor
multiplying linear dimensions, so in this case the volume of the
larger box equals
\[\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^3 = 2^{\frac{3}{2}} \approx 2.828 \]
times that of the smaller box.  I received a question of whether the
boxes are point only on the inside, or both the inside and the
outside.  Intriguingly, it does not matter!
