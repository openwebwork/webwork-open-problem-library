You have a cube of gold.  Your friend (even though she may not be your
friend much longer) has a cube of gold that is twice as long (and wide
and high).  Your friend's cube weighs \{ ans_rule(10) \} as much as
yours,

You also have a spherical diamond.  Your friend has a spherical
diamond of twice the diameter of yours.  Your friend's diamond weighs \{

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Doubling the radius or length multiplies the
volume with \(2^3=8\) and the surface area with \(2^2=4\).
