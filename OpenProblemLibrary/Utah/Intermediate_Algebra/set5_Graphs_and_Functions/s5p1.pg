$BR Consider the inequality

\[3x + 7 < 2\]

By subtracting 7 on both sides and dividing by 3 we see that this
inequality is equivalent to \[x < -\frac{5}{3}.\]

The first few problems in this set are similar.  In the above example
you would enter \(<\) and \(-\frac{5}{3}\) as your answers.



$BR In the actual first problem of this set consider the inequality 
\[ $a x + $b < $c \]
Below insert the appropriate symbol 
\(<\) or \(>\) and the appropriate number such that the two
inequalities are equivalent.
$BR \( x \)  \{ ans_rule(1) \} (insert symbol)

ANS(str_cmp("<"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(10) \} (insert number)

$BR As usual I recommend that you enter non-integer answers as fractions
rather than decimal expressions. 

EOT

$answer=($c-$b)/$a;
ANS(num_cmp($answer));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: Figure out what bothers you and get rid of it 
by doing the same thing on both sides of the inequality.

\[x < $answer.\]
