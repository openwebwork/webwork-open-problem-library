TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

You are going to drive 480 miles today at an average speed of 
60 miles per hour.  Thus you are going to drive for a total of
\{ ans_rule(5) \} hours.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The diameter of the wheels on your car (including tires) is 25 inches.
Thus each wheel is going to turn a total of  \{ ans_rule(10) \} times today.



EOT



ANS(num_cmp(480*5280*12/25/3.141593, relTol=>0.1));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

At one turn each wheel of your car  rolls a distance that
equals its circumference.  
So to obtain the number of turns we need to
divide the distance covered by the circumference of the wheel.  For
this division to make sense we have to express both lengths in the
same units.  The circumference of the wheel equals its diameter times
\(\pi\).  (That's actually the definition of \(\pi\), it's the ratio of
the circumference of a circle and its diameter.)  So the circumference of
your wheels equals \(25 \pi \) inches.  There are 5280 feet in a mile
and 12 inches in a foot.  The number of turns therefore equals
\[\frac{480\times 5280 \times 12}{25 \pi} \approx 387228.\]
(The symbol \(\approx\) means "equals approximately".)
