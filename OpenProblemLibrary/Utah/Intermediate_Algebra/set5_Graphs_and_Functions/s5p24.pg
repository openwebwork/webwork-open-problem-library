You are working on a new temperature scale that will unify the earth.
After some thought you decide to call 
it the $BBOLD $studentName-universal-scale. $EBOLD  Let \(F\) denote the
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and let \(X\) denote your new
temperature scale.  You want it to be such that
if \(F=0\) then \(X=$a\) and if \(F=100\) then \(X=$b\). 
You also want \(X\) to be such that if you plot \(X\) against \(F\)
you obtain a straight line.  (This is described as "linear
interpolation" in the textbook.) You obtain the formula
$BR
\(X = m F + b \) 
$BR
where
\(m\) =  \{ ans_rule(20) \} 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp("($b-$a)/100"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR 
and
\(b\) =  \{ ans_rule(20) \} 

EOT

ANS(num_cmp("$a"));

$BR Hint:
Think of this problem as one of finding the slope-intercept form of a
straight line in the \( (F,X) \) plane given two points on the line.
