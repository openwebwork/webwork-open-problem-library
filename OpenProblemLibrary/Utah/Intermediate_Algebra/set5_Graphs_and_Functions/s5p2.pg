$BR Consider the inequality 
\[ -$a x + $b < $c \]
Below insert the appropriate symbol 
\(<\) or \(>\) and the appropriate number such that the two
inequalities are equivalent.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: Figure out what bothers you and get rid of it 
by doing the same thing on both sides of the inequality.  Think
carefully about the effect of what you are doing.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Subtract $b on both sides and then divide by -$a.
Since we are dividing by a negative number we reverse the inequality and obtain
\[x > $answer.\]
EOT
