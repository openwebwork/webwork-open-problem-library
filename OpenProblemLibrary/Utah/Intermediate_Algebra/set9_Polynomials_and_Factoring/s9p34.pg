Here is a small challenge for your entertainment and gratification.
For any natural number \(n\), let \(f(n)\) denote the sum of the
numbers from 1 to \(n\).  Thus \(f(1) = 1\), \(f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3\),
\(f(3) = 1 + 2 + 3=6\), \(f(100) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 100 = 5050\),
etc.
$BR
It turns out that \(f\) is a  polynomial of degree 2 in \(n\).  
Figure out the coefficients of \(f\):
$BR \(f(n)=\) \{ ans_rule(3) \}\(n^2\)

$BR There is a story about Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) who may
have been the most outstanding mathematician in human history.
According to the story, when Gauss was seven years old, his teacher at
one stage was unhappy with the class and as a punishment he asked
them to compute \(f(100)\).  Gauss' class mates started writing the
numbers from 1 to 100 on their paper, and adding those numbers.  Gauss
stared at the ceiling and then wrote the single number \(5050\) on the
sheet and handed it in.  You aren't Gauss, but you also aren't seven
years old, so maybe you can figure out what he was thinking!

Think about how to do this in your head for large values of \(n\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The story goes that 7 year old Gauss reasoned as follows: add 1
and 100 to get 101.  Add 2 and 99 to get 101.  Add 3 and 98 to get
101.  You form 50 pairs of numbers, each of which has a sum of 101.
The total sum is \[50 \times 101 = 5050.\] For general \(n\) we can
argue as follows: Add the first and last number to get \(n+1\).  Add
the second and next to last to get \(n+1\).  Continue doing so.  You
form \(n/2\) pairs, each of which has a sum of \(n+1\).  The result is
\[f(n) = \frac{n}{2}(n+1) = \frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{2}.\] You might
want to ponder what happens to this argument when \(n\) is odd and you
can't form a natural number of pairs.  The formula still works,
however.
