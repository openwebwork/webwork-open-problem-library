You fire a rifle straight up.  Your bullet leaves your gun at a

Consider the muzzle of your gun to be at height zero.
The bullet will reach its maximum altitude of  \{ ans_rule(10) \} feet

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
It's easier first to figure out at what time the bullet reaches its maximum altitude.
At that time its speed is zero, so we solve 
\(0 = $v - 32t \) which gives 
\(t=\frac{$v}{32} = $t\) seconds. 
Substituting this value of \(t\) in the
height formula gives 
\(h($t) = 0+$v \times $t - 16 \times $t^2 = $h\) feet.
