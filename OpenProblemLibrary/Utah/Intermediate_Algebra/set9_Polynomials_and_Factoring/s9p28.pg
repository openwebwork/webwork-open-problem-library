an example where it does not hold.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR
$BR The graph of a linear polynomial is a straight line. Yes!  
Home work 5 and the associated material
discussed at great length the correspondence between linear functions
and their graphs.

$BR The degree of a trinomial is at least 2.   Yes, because with a
polynomial of degree less than 2 you can have at most 2 terms.

$BR The product of two polynomials is always a polynomial.  Yes.

$BR The quotient of two polynomials is always a polynomial.   No,
for example not in the case \[f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x+2}.\]

$BR The sum of two polynomials is always a polynomial.  Yes.

$BR The difference of two polynomials is always a polynomial. 
Yes. So you can add, subtract and multiply polynomials, and you'll
still have a polynomial.  You cannot always divided them and still
have a polynomial.
