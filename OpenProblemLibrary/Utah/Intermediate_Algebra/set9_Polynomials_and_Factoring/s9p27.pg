SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD

$BR

$BR The product of 2 linear polynomials is quadratic.  Yes, you get
an \(x^2\) term.

$BR The sum of two cubic polynomials cannot have a degree greater
than 3.  That's true since adding does not change the exponents.
When adding numbers we can trade low powers of 10 for higher powers of
10, but the analog is not true for polynomials.

$BR The sum of two cubic polynomials may have a degree less than 3.
Yes, if the leading terms cancel.  For example, \[(x^3+1) +(- x^3 )=
1.\] The sum has degree 0.

$BR The sum of a cubic and a quartic polynomial may have a degree
different from 4.  No.  The cubic polynomial cannot change the
leading term of the quartic polynomial.

$BR The product of two monomial is a monomial.  yes - the new
exponent is the sum of the two original exponents.

$BR The product of two binomial is a binomial.  Not in general,
although for example \[(x+1)(x-1) = x^2-1.\] So in this case the
product is a binomial.  On the other hand, \[(x+1)(x+2) = x^2 + 3x +
2.\]
