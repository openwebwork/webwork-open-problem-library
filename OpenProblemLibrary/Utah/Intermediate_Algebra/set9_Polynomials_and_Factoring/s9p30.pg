Suppose you add a polynomial of degree \(m\) to  a polynomial of degree \(n\)
where \(m > n \).  Then the result is a polynomial of degree

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
 Look at the example \(p(x) = x^3\) and \(q(x) = x^2\).  The degree
of \(p\) is \(m = 3\) and that of \(q\) is \(n= 2.\) The degree of the
sum \(p(x)+q(x) = x^3 + x^2\) is 3.  In general the leading term of
the higher degree polynomial is unaffected by the lower degree
polynomial, and the degree of the sum is \(m\),
