TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that as you throw the rock in the preceding question, you also give it a forward motion of 20 feet per second. The rock will hit the ground
\{ ans_rule(10) \} feet away from you, measured horizontally.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(80));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The rock remains in the air four 4 seconds.  During that time it
moves horizontally at 20 feet per second, for a total distance of 80
feet.
