TEXT(beginproblem());

$t=random(15,25,1);
$v=16*$t;
$d=$t*$v;

BEGIN_TEXT
You fire a rifle at an angle of 45 degrees.
Thus the initial horizontal and vertical velocities of your bullet
are the same. Suppose they each equal $v feet per second.
Again ignore air resistance. Assume you are shooting from ground level
(height 0).
Your  bullet will hit the ground   \{ ans_rule(10) \} feet from your
current position.
END_TEXT
ANS(num_cmp($d));

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Again, we have to figure out how long the bullet is in the air,
and then how far it travels during that time.  To find the time it's
airborne we set \(h\) to zero: \(0 = 0 + $v t - 16 t^2 \) which means
\(t=$t\). During that time the bullet travels \($t\times $v = $d\)
feet. Some rifle!
