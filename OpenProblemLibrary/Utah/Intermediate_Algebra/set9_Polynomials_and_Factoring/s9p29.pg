TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you multiply a polynomial of degree \(m\) with a polynomial of degree \(n\).  The result is a polynomial of degree
\{ ans_rule(5) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The highest power of \(x\) in the product of the two polynomials
is the product of the leading terms.  You multiply powers with the
same base by adding the exponents.  Thus the exponent of the leading
term is the sum of the exponents of the leading terms of the two polynomials.
