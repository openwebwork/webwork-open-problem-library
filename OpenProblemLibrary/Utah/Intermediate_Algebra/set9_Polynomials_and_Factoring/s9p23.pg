TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This may be a little more challenging, but $BBOLD you do not need to 
expand 
this polynomial to standard form! $EBOLD
Let the polynomial \(p\) be defined by
\[p(x) = (x+2)^{17}.\]
The degree of \(p\) is
 \{ ans_rule(4) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(17));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR its leading coefficient is  \{ ans_rule(4) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR and its constant term is  \{ ans_rule(4) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2**17));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
There are \(17\) factors \((x+2)\). If we expand \(p\) we obtain the
highest power of \(x\) by picking \(x\) from each factor, which gives
\(x^{17}\).  The constant term is obtained by picking \(2\) from each
factor which gives \(2^{17} =  131,072.\)


It is not necessary to compute the standard from of \(p\), but here it
is for your information and entertainment:
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
&p =
x^{17} + 34x^{16} + 544x^{15} + 5,440x^{14} + 38,080x^{13} \\ 
&+ 198,016x^{12} + 792,064x^{11} + 2,489,344x^{10} \\
&+ 6,223,360x^{9} 
+ 12,446,720x^{8} + 19,914,752x^{7}\\ 
&+ 25,346,048x^{6} + 25,346,048x^{5} + 19,496,960x^{4} \\
&+ 11,141,120x^{3} + 4,456,448x^{2} + 1,114,112x \\
&+ 131,072.\\
\end{array}
