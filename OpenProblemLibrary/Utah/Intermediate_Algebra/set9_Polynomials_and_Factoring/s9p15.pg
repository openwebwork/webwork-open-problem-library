SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
There are four linear factors.  The highest power of \(x\) can be
obtained by picking the factor \(x\) from each of the individual
factors, which gives a degree of \(4\).  All those terms \(x\) have
the factor \(1\), and so the leading coefficient is \(1^4=1\).  The
constant term is the product of the constant terms of the individual
factors, i.e., it is 24.

However, if this argument mystifies you you can obtain the same result
by converting the polynomial to standard form.

We obtain
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
p(x) &=& (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) \\
&=& \left(x^2-3x+2\right)\left(x^2-7x+12\right) \\
&=& x^4 -3x^3 +2x^2 \\
&&\phantom{x^4} -7x^3+21x^2 -14x \\
&&\phantom{x^4-7x^3}+12x^2 -36x+24 \\
&=& x^4-10x^3+35x^2-50x+24.
\end{array}
\]

It is often the case in mathematics (and elsewhere) that 
brute force works and gives the desired results, but 
a lot of work can be saved by applying insight instead.
