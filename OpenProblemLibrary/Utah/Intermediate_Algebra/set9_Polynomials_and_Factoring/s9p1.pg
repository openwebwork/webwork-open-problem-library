BEGIN_TEXT
The height \(h(t)\) at the time \(t\) of a rock tossed into the
air at time \(0\) from an initial height \(h_0\) 
at an initial velocity \(v_0\)  is given
by \[h(t) = h_0 + v_0t - 16 t^2.\]
where time is measured in seconds, height in feet, and velocity in feet per
second.  The positive direction is up, so if the rock is moving down
then its velocity is negative. The magic number 16 in this equation is due
to the mass and radius of earth and would be different for example on
Mars or on the Moon.  The velocity of the rock at time \(t\) is given by
\[v(t) = v_0 -32t.\]
Suppose you throw a rock upward from a height of 64 feet with an initial velocity of 48 feet per second.  The rock will hit the ground after
\{ ans_rule(10) \} seconds.

ANS(num_cmp(4));

BEGIN_HINT
Solve a quadratic equation
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Mathematically the ground corresponds to the
height of zero.  We simply set \(h\) to zero in the height formula and
obtain: \[0 = h_0 + v_0t - 16 t^2= 64 +48t -16t^2.\] This is a
quadratic equation that has the solutions \(t=-1\) and \(t=4\).
The negative solution has no physical significance.  Thus the rock
hits the ground after 4 seconds.  (You can get this result also by
applying the quadratic formula
