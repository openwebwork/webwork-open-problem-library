A linear system may have a unique solution, no solution, 
or infinitely many solutions.  Indicate the type of the system for the
following examples by $BITALIC U $EITALIC , $BITALIC N $EITALIC , or  
$BITALIC I $EITALIC , 
respectively.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: 
This is like the preceding problem.  If you are stuck, solve the
linear systems and see if you come up with a contradiction (i.e., no
solution), a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The following list contains more examples than are given in your
problem.
It does include your particular  problems, however.

$BR
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}-2x+y&=&5\\ 2x-y &=& -5\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
There are infinitely many solutions since the second equation is
equivalent to the first, from which it can be obtained by multiplying
with \(-1\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&0\\ 2x+4y &=& 0\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
The unique solution of this system is \(x=y=0\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x-3y&=&5\\ 4x-6y &=& 10\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
There are infinitely many solutions since the second equation is
equivalent to the first, from which it can be obtained by multiplying
with \(2\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}x-3y&=&5\\ x+3y &=& 5\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
The unique solution of this system is \(x=5\) and \(y=0\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}x-y&=&15\\ y-x &=& 15\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
There is no solution since the left hand sides are negatives of each other,
whereas the right hand sides are not.
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&0\\ 4x+6y &=& 0\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
There are infinitely many solutions since the second equation can be
obtained form the first by multiplying with 2.
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&1\\ 4x+6y &=& 1\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
There is no solution since the left hand sides of the second equation
is twice the left hand side of the first, but the corresponding right
hand sides are equal.
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}2x+3y&=&5\\ x+6y &=& 7\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
The unique solution of this system is \(x=y=1\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}x+y&=&5\\ x+2y &=& 10\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
The unique solution o f this system is \(x=0\) and \(y=5\).
$BR \(\begin{array}{rrcl}7x+3y&=&\pi\\ 4x-6y &=& \pi^2\\ \end{array}\) 
$BR
This system has a unique solution.  This follows from the fact that
the left hand sides are not multiples of each other.  However you can
also see this by actually solving the system which gives \[x=
\frac{\pi^2+2\pi}{18}\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad
y=\frac{-7\pi^2+4\pi}{54}.\]
