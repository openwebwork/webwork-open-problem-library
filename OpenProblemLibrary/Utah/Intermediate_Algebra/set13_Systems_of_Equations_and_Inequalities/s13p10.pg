TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The cubic polynomial \(p\) satisfying
\[p(x) = 2^x\quad\hbox{for}\qquad x = 0,1,2,3\]
is
EOT

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(p(x)=\) \{ ans_rule(60) \}.  
$BR 
Enter your solution as
an algebraic expression in \(x\).  
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(x^3+5x+6)/6"));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's say our cubic polynomial is of the form
\[p(x) =  ax^3 +bx^2 + cx + d.\]
Then we need to solve the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrcl}
& & & d & = & 1 \\
+a & +b & +c & +d & = & 2 \\
 +8a & +4b & 2c & +d  & = & 4 \\
 +27a & +9b & +3c & +d  & = & 8 \\
\end{array}
\]
This can be done like illustrated in the preceding homework problems
and it gives the solution
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
a &=&\frac{1}{6}, \\
b &=& 0 ,\\
c &=& \frac{5}{6},\\
d &=& 1\\
\end{array}
\]
and hence 
\[p(x) = \frac{x^3+5x+6}{6}, \qquad(*)\]
which you can enter into WeBWorK as
$BR
$BITALIC(x**3+5x+6)/6$EITALIC
$BR
(This expression is displayed in this unusual format so you can cut
and paste it into the above answer window.) 


However, we already have the quartic
\[q(x) = \frac{x^4-2x^3+11x^2+14x+24}{24}\]
which does more than \(p\) and satisfies 
\[q(0) = 1,\quad q(1) = 2, \quad q(2) = 4, \quad q(3) =8, \quad\hbox{and}\quad q(4) = 16.\]
Can we modify \(q\) to get \(p\)?  Yes! Consider
\[p(x) = q(x) - \frac{x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}{24}.\]
The term we subtract will cancel the leading coefficient of \(q\).
Also note that it is zero when
\(x=0,1,2,3\).  Thus 
\[\begin{array}{rcrcl}
p(0) &=& q(0) &=& 1, \\
p(1) &=& q(1) &=& 2, \\
p(2) &=& q(2) &=& 4,\\
p(3) &=& q(3) &=& 8.\\
\end{array}
\]

You can easily work out that \(p\) defined in this manner is indeed
equal to \(p\) defined in equation \((*)\) above.
but you can make your life easier and enter the solution directly as
$BR
$BITALIC (x**4-2x**3+11x**2+14x+24)/24-x*(x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)/24$EITALIC
$BR
Try cutting and pasting it in the answer window.

As an exercise for you entertainment you may want to use a similar
idea to find a quintic polynomial \(r\) that satisfies \[r(x) =
2^x\quad\hbox{for}\qquad x = 0,1,2,3,4,5.\] Let me know if you do find
it!
