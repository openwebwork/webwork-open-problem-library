The ubiquitous 12oz aluminum cans used to distribute drinks in this

For completeness let me recall how we optimized the can.


The volume \(V\) and the area \(A\) of our cans is given by
\[V= \pi r^2 h = {\pi\over 4} d^2 h \quad\hbox{and}\quad A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = \pi
\left({d^2\over 2} + dh\right) \] where \(r\) is the radius of the
can.  The standard way of approaching this problem would be to use the
volume formula to express \(d\) or \(h\) in terms of the other, substitute
in the area formula, differentiate the area with respect to the
remaining variable (\(h\) or \(d\), respectively), find out where the derivative is
zero, then compute the previously eliminated variable, and finally
compute the optimum ratio.  We expect that ratio to be independent of
the volume of the can.  In other words, the optimal $BITALIC shape$EITALIC of the
can should be independent of its volume.
We used this approach in class on Monday, and it
works just fine.

However, just to illustrate another possibility, let's approach the
problem more directly.  Let's give a name 
\[\alpha = {d \over h}  \]
to the quantity we want to find, and express everything directly in
terms of that quantity, \(\alpha\).

It follows that \[d = \alpha h \quad\hbox{and
thus} \quad V= {\pi \alpha^2 \over 4} h^3. \]
Hence \[h^3 = {4V \over \pi\alpha^2} \quad\hbox{and}\quad h = \left({4V \over
\pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^{-2/3}. \]
We also obtain
\[d = \alpha\left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^ {-2/3} =
\left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^ {1/3}. \]

Hence the area that we want to minimize is given by
\[A = \pi \left({1\over 2} \left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{2/3} \alpha
^{2/3} +\left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{2/3}\alpha^{1/3}\alpha^{-2/3}\right)
\]
\[ = \pi \left({4V\over
\pi}\right)^{2/3}\left({1\over 2} \alpha^{2/3} +
\alpha^{-1/3}\right). \]
For this expression to be minimized, the factor containing \(\alpha\),
i.e.,
\[F(\alpha) = {1\over 2} \alpha^{2/3} +
\alpha^{-1/3} \]
must be minimized.
Differentiating and setting the derivative to zero gives
\[F'(\alpha) = {1\over 3} \alpha^{-1/3} - {1\over 3} \alpha^{-4/3} = 
{\alpha^{-4/3}\over 3} (\alpha -1 ) =0. \]
The best ratio \(\alpha\) is clearly some positive real number, so
the only critical point is \[{\alpha = {d \over h} = 1} \]
and so those optimal cans are as tall as they are wide. 


Now let's turn to the potential savings of aluminum.


Clearly, the cans used in the US do not have what we computed as the
$BITALIC optimal shape$EITALIC in the preceding problem.  Since we figure the
savings as a percentage of the total amount of aluminum used currently
we can work with the function \(F\) rather than the area itself.  For
the common cans \[\alpha = { d
\over h} = {2.75 \over 5} = {11\over 20}.\]  For that value
\[F(\alpha) = {1\over 2} \left({11\over 20}\right)^{2/3} +
\left({11\over 20}\right)^{-1/3} \approx 1.5562. \]
On the other hand, the minimum value of \(F\) is
\[F(1) = {1\over 2} + 1 = 1.5. \] Therefore the potential savings
\(p\) figured as an approximate percentage are
\[p=100 \times {1.5562 - 1.5 \over 1.5} = 3.74\hbox{percent}. \] We could
only save a little less than 4$PERCENT of the aluminum using those optimal cans, and of
course there are other considerations like attractiveness as a
drinking vessel and similarly arcane marketing and consumer appeal
considerations.  Besides, it would cost a vast amount of
money to reconfigure the existing infrastructure of manufacturing and
distributing equipment at this stage.  Still, 4$PERCENT of the aluminum used
in this country to make cans is a lot of aluminum!
