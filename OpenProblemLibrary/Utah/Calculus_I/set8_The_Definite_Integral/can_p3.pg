TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In the preceding two problems we define a can to be optimal if it has the
least surface area for a given volume.  In this problem we assume
the real issue in can manufacturing is cost, and the industry has
figured out which shape minimizes the cost of making the cans.
(Of course there are other issues, like how the can fits into one's
hand and whatever marketing appeal a given shape might have. Also
consider that once the country is saturated with vending machines it
would be very expensive to make substantial changes in the shape of
the can.)

The familiar 12oz aluminum can is made of two parts, a shell and a lid.
Assume that the total manufacturing cost for the lid and the shell is 
\( C = 6.5 \) cents. $BR

The manufacturing cost of the lid consists of a fixed 
cost of \( M_{L} = 4.24 \) cents per lid, and an additional cost that
is proportional to the area of the lid. Thus the total cost is
\[ C_{L} = M_{L} + \kappa_{L} \pi \frac{d^2}{4}\] cents per lid, for some
constant \(\kappa_L\).  $BR

Similarly, the 
manufacturing cost of the shell consists of a fixed cost 
of \( M_{S} = 1.185 \) cents per shell, and an additional cost that is 
proportional to the surface area of the shell. Thus the total cost is
\[ C_{S} = M_{S} + \kappa_{S} [\pi h d + \pi \frac{d^2}{4}]\] cents per
shell, for some constant \(\kappa_{S}\). $BR

Assuming that the total manufacturing cost of the can is minimized
for a diameter of 2.75 inches and a height of 5.0 inches, what are 
the variable costs involved with the manufacture of the cans?$BR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We start with the total cost \(C\) being
\[C=M_L + \kappa_L\frac{\pi d^2}{4} + M_S +\kappa_s\left(\pi hd+
\frac{\pi d^2}{4}\right)\quad (*)\]

To get a handle on the shape of the can we need to get rid of \(h\) or \(d\). 
The volume,\(V\), of the can is
\[V = \frac{\pi d^2h}{4}.\]
Thus
\[h = \frac{4V}{\pi d^2}.\]
Substituting for \(h\) in the cost equation gives
\[C = M_L +
\kappa_L\frac{\pi d^2}{4}+M_S+\kappa_s\left(\frac{4V\pi d}{\pi d^2}+
\frac{\pi d^2}{4}\right).\]
This can be simplified and rearranged to give:
\[\frac{\pi d^2}{4}\kappa_L + \left(\frac{4V}{d}-\frac{\pi
d^2}{4}\right)\kappa_S = C-M_L -M_S.\quad(**)\]

The key assumption in this problem is that the dimensions of the can
are chosen so as to minimize the cost of making them.  Thus the
derivative of the cost with respect to the diameter is 0:

\[\frac{dC}{dd} = \frac{\pi d}{2} \kappa_L + \left(\frac{\pi d}{2} +
\frac{4V}{d^2} \right) \kappa_S = 0. \quad(***)\]
\((**)\) and \((***)\) are two linear equations in the unknowns
\(\kappa_L\) and \(\kappa_S\).  To solve it we multiply in \((***)\)
wit \(\frac{d}{2}\) which gives

\[\frac{\pi d^2}{4}\kappa_L+\left(\frac{\pi d^2}{4} - \frac{2V}{d}
\right) \kappa_S = 0.\] 

and subtract this equation from  \((**)\) which gives
\[\frac{6V}{d}\kappa_s = C-M_L-M_S\]
i.e,
\[\kappa_S = \frac{d}{6V}(C-M_L-M_S).\]

Substituting our numbers 
\[C= 6.5, \quad M_L=4.24,\quad M_S = 1.185,\quad r=2.75, \quad h=5\]
gives
\[\kappa_S=0.01659.\]
Substituting \(\kappa_s\) in \((*)\) and solving for \(\kappa_L\)
gives
\[\kappa_L = 0.04374.\]
