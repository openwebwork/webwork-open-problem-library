TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A can manufacturer located in Oklahoma City produces aluminum cans for
one major cola company.  The distribution area for these cans 
includes about 13$PERCENT of the US population located in
New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas,
Louisiana and southwestern Missouri. $BR

Inside the plant, there are eight stamping presses that manufacture 
can lids.  Each press stamps two lids per stroke and on average runs
at 500 strokes per minute.  The machines run 24 hours a day for an
average of 300 days per year.  (The only time that the machines stop
running is for two two week maintenance breaks, 10 holidays, and 
an additional 27 days due to miscellaneous break downs.) $BR

If the total volume of aluminum for one can is
\( V_{c} = 8.69 \times 10^{-7} \) cubic meters and the cost of 
processed aluminum is 6210.00 dollars per cubic meter,
how many dollars would be saved by changing the design of the can? $BR

Savings equals \{&ans_rule(20)\} dollars. $BR
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3456000000*.000000869*6210*$p));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The total amount \(A\) spent per year on aluminum
is
\[
A=2\times 8 \times 500 \times 60 \times 24 \times 300 \times 8.69
\times 10^{-7} \times 6210 \approx \$ 18,650,269.
\] 
We saw
earlier that the optimal cans use about 3.744 percent less aluminum.
This corresponds to a saving of almost 700,000 dollars.  A tidy
amount, but we'd all have to drink out of disk shaped cans!
