The graph of the equation 
\[x^2+xy+y^2=9\]
is a slanted ellipse illustrated in this figure:
$BR

\{image("fig.gif", height => 512, width => 512);\}


Think of \(y\) as a function of \(x\).  Differentiating 
implicitly and solving for \(y'\) gives:
$BR
\(y'=\)  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
(Your answer will depend on \(x\) and  \(y\).)


EOT
ANS(multivar_function_cmp("-(2*x+y)/(x+2*y)",["x","y"],[[1,2],[1,2]]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The ellipse has two horizontal tangents.  The upper one has the equation

$BR \(y=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(12)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR The right most vertical tangent has the equation
$BR \(x=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(12)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR That tangent touches the ellipse where 
$BR \(y=\) \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-sqrt(12)/2));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The horizontal tangent is of course
characterized by \(y'=0\).  To find the vertical tangent use symmetry,
or think of \(x\) as a function of \(y\), differentiate implicitly,
solve for \(x'\) and then set \(x'=0\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Differentiating implicitly in
\[x^2+xy+y^2=9\]
gives
\[2x + y + xy' +2yy' = 0.\]
Solving for \(y'\) gives 
\[y' = -\frac{2x+y}{x+2y}.\]
Setting
\[y'=0\] and solving for \(x\) gives
\[2x+y = 0\quad \Longrightarrow \quad x = -\frac{y}{2}.\]
Substituting in the original equation
gives
\[\frac{y^2}{4}-\frac{y^2}{2} + y^2 = 9.\]
Thus 
\[\frac{3y^2}{4} = 9\]
or
\[y^2 = 12.\]
Hence the horizontal asymptotes have the equations
 \[y = \pm \sqrt{12}.\]
The plus sign gives the upper asymptote, the minus sign the lower.
By  symmetry the vertical asymptotes have the equations
\[x = \pm \sqrt{12}.\]
The rightmost vertical asymptote with the equation
\[x = \sqrt{12}\] touches the ellipse in the point where
\[y = -\frac{x}{2} = - \frac{\sqrt{12}}{2} = -\sqrt{3}.\]
