TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The period of a simple pendulum of length \(L\) feet is given by
\[T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \hbox{~seconds.}\]
We assume that \(g\), the acceleration due to gravity on the surface
of the earth, is 32 feet per second per second.  If the pendulum is
that of a clock that keeps good time when \(L = 4\) feet, how much time
will the clock gain in 24 hours if the length of the pendulum is
decreased to 3.97 feet?  (Use differentials and evaluate the necessary derivative at \(L=4\) feet.)

Your answer: \{&ans_rule(5)\} seconds.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Note that there are \(24\times 60\times 60 = 86,400 \) seconds in a day.
Let \[T(L) = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = 2\pi \left(\frac{L}{g}\right)^{1/2}.\]
Then
\[T'(L) = \pi \left(\frac{L}{g}\right)^{-1/2} \times \frac{1}{g}.\]
The  approximate time discrepancy is
\[\frac{T'(4)(4-3.97)}{T(4)}\times 86,400 = 324 \hbox{~seconds.}\]
