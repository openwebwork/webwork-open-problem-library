TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity says that the mass \(m\) of an
object moving at a velocity \(v\) is given by the formula \[m =
\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}=m_0\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^{-1/2}.\]
Here \(m_0\) is the rest mass (mass at velocity 0) and \(c\) is the
velocity of light. Use differentials to estimate the percentage
increase of the object as its velocity increases from \(v=0.94c\) to
\(0.95c\).  Evaluate the necessary derivative at \(v=0.94c\).

$BR Your answer: \{&ans_rule(5)\} percent.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \[m(v) =
m_0\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^{-1/2}.\] Then \[m'(v) =
-\frac{m_0}{2}\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^{-3/2}\times
\left(-\frac{2v}{c^2}\right)= \frac{m_0 v}{c^2}
\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^{-3/2}.\] We want to compute \[p =
\frac{100\times w'(0.94)\times (0.95-0.94) }{w(0.94)}\approx 8.08
\char37.\]

$BR Note: Since we are computing a percentage the value of the rest
mass \(m_0\) does not matter.  We could simply set it equal to 1.
