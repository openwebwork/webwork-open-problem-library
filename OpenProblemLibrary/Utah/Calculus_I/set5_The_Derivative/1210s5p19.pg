TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The altitude of a triangle is increasing at a rate of \(!{$altSpeed:%5.1f} \)
centimeters/minute while the area of the triangle is increasing at a rate
of \(!{$areaSpeed:%5.1f}\) square centimeters/minute.  At what rate is the base
of the triangle changing when the altitude is \(!{$alt:%5.1f}\) centimeters and
the area is \(!{$area:%5.1f}\) square centimeters?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The area \(A\) of a triangle with base \(b\)
and height \(h\) is given by \[A = \frac{1}{2}bh.\] Differentiating
implicitly gives \[A'=\frac{1}{2}(b'h+bh').\] Solving for \(b'\)
gives \[b'=\frac{2A'-bh'}{h}.\] In this expression, we know \(A'\),
\(h'\) and \(h\).  We don't know \(b\) but we do know \(A\).  Solving
the area formula for \(b\) gives \[b=\frac{2A}{h}.\] Thus
\[b'=\frac{2A'h-2Ah'}{h^2}.\] Substituting
\[A'=$areaSpeed,\quad h=$alt,\quad h'=2, \quad\hbox{and}\quad A=$area\]
gives
\[b'\approx !{$ans:%5.3f}\hbox{~centimeters per minute.}\]
Note that the base is shrinking, as indicated by the negative sign.
