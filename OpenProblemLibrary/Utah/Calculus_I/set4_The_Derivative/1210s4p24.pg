TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Newton's Method will converge to a true solution if you have a good initial approximation.
If you don't it may not converge at all.  Consider, for example, the equation
\[f(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)=x^3-x = 0.\]
Obviously, the solutions are \[x=\quad -1,\quad 0, \quad 1.\]
If we start Newton's Method with \(x_0\) being close to one of these solutions we will get convergence to that solution.  On the other hand,
note that 
 \[f'(x) = 3x^2-1 \]
is zero when \[x=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.\]
Thus the tangent will be horizontal in those two cases, and Newton's can't even be carried out.

$BR In this problem we'll investigate what happens in the contrived
case that \[x_0= \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}.\] 
You can enter \(x_0\) into WeBWorK as
$BITALIC sqrt(5)/5. $EITALIC  Try it:

$BR
\(x_0 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \},  
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($x));

Now do your computations using exact
arithmetic, and you'll recognize a pattern:


$BR
\(x_1 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \},  
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(-$x));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(x_2 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \},  
EOT

ANS(num_cmp($x));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(x_3 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \},  
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-$x));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(x_4 = \) \{ans_rule(10) \},  
$BR Draw a picture to see what's going on.  Note, however, that
Newton's method may fail in many different ways.  A detailed analysis
of Newton's method and related methods is a huge subject and well
beyond the scope of our class.
