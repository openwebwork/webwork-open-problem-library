TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
As discussed in class, there may be more variables floating around than the one with respect to which we differentiate.  In that situation it is important to 
be aware with respect to which variable we differentiate.

$BR

For example, the volume of a square box width \(s\) and height \(h\)
is given 
\[V = s^2 h.\]
Thus
$BR
\(D_s V = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("2*s*h", limits=>[[1,10],[1,10]], vars=>["s","h"]));

and $BR
\(D_h V = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("s*s", limits=>[[1,10],[1,10]], vars=>["s","h"]));
