You are wondering how inaccuracies in the radius or height of your can effect 
the volume of the can.  Use differentials to answer the questions below.

$BR

An error of \(p\) percent in the radius will cause an error of approximately
\{&ans_rule(5)\} percent in the volume of the can.

EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("2*p", vars=>["p"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR

An error of \(p\) percent in the height will cause an error of approximately
\{&ans_rule(5)\} percent in the volume of the can.

$BR  Note that although the sentences above contain the word "approximately",
the answers are actually determined precisely by the procedure with which we compute them.  
For example for the dependence on the radius you consider \(h\) constant,
and you use the differentials \[d V = V'(r) d r.\]
The percentage of the error in \(v\) is
\[\frac{100 \hbox{dV}}{V}\] and you know that 
\[p = \frac{100 d r}{r} \quad\hbox{and}\quad 
d V = \frac{d V}{d r}{d r}.\]
Your answer will depend on \(p\).  
Proceed similarly for the dependence of the error on \(h\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
If \(r\) is the radius of the can, and \(h\) its height, then its volume is 
\[V = \pi r^2 h.\]
Let's first consider the dependence of the volume on the radius.  We
have for the relative change in the volume: \[\frac{\d V}{V} =
\frac{\frac{d V}{\displaystyle d r} d r}{V} = \frac{2\pi r h d r}
{\pi r^2 h} = 2 \frac{d r}{r}.\] A change of \(p\) in the radius will 
give a change
of \(2p\) percent in the volume.

$BR Proceeding similarly for a change in the height we obtain:
\[\frac{d V}{V} = \frac
{\frac{d V}{d h} d h}{V} = \frac{\pi r^2  d h}{\pi r^2 h} = 
\frac{d h}{h}.\]

 A change of \(p\) in the radius will give a change of \(p\) percent
in the volume.  If it matters you want to be more careful about the
radius than the height of the can.
