Suppose you drop a rock into the center
of a very deep well with a diameter of 2 feet, located on the equator.
Suppose there is no air resistance.  (Think of the well as being
sealed or located at the moon.)  Enter T or F for the following
statements.
$BR
 The top of the well rotates with the Earth towards the East. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The top of the well rotates with the Earth towards the West. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The top of the well rotates with the Earth towards the South. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The top of the well rotates with the Earth towards the North. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The rock will fall straight down until it hits the center of the bottom of the well. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The rock will hit the East wall of the well. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The rock will hit the West wall of the well. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The rock will hit the North wall of the well. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 The rock will hit the South wall of the well. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
 None of these statements are true. \{ans_rule(3)\}
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));
