TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The function \[f(x) = x^3+x-1\]
has a root between 0.6 and 0.8.  It is:
\{ans_rule(10)\}.
Enter your answer with at least three digits.  You can compute it
using the bisection method described in class.  (You might also find a
more efficient way, but the bisection method is sure to work!)
