TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The ceiling of an
attic makes an angle of \(40^\circ\) with the floor.  A pipe of radius
6 inches is placed along the edge of the attic in such a way that the
pipe touches both the ceiling and the floor of the attic. The distance
from the edge of the attic to the point where the pipe touches the
floor is
 \{ ans_rule(20) \} inches.

$Pi = 2*acos(0.0);
$answer = 6/tan(20/180*$Pi);

ANS(num_cmp($answer));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The line from the edge of the attic to the
center of the pipe bisects the angle of 40 degrees.  It forms a right
triangle with the floor and the vertical radius of the pipe.  If the
required distance is \(x\) then \[\frac{6}{x} = \tan 20^\circ, \] and
hence 
\[x = \frac{6}{\tan 20^\circ } \approx 16.48\hbox{inches}.\]
