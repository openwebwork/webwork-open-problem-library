TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The next few problems are simple exercises in logic.  Section 1.1 of the
textbook discusses the concept of the $BITALIC converse$EITALIC, the 
$BITALIC
contrapositive, $EITALIC
and the $BITALIC negation$EITALIC of a statement.  
For example,
consider the statement $BITALIC all natural numbers are real numbers.$EITALIC
(This is a true statement, but this is actually not important for this
discussion.)  This statement can be put as an implication: $BITALIC if
\(x\) is a natural number, then \(x\) is a real number. $EITALIC  The 
$BBOLD converse$EBOLD
of this statement is $BITALIC all real numbers are natural numbers$EITALIC, or
$BITALIC if \(x\) is a real number then it is a natural number$EITALIC, 
(which is a false statement), the $BBOLD contrapositive$EBOLD is $BITALIC 
if \(x\) is not a real
number then it isn't a natural number $EITALIC (which is a true 
statement), and
the $BBOLD negation$EBOLD of the statement is $BITALIC some natural 
numbers are not
real numbers $EITALIC (which is a false statement).  

$BR The purpose this particular problem is to illustrate the pattern
of the next couple of problems.  You already know the answers, so it
is just a matter of entering them.  In this problem, WeBWorK will tell
you separately for each answer whether it is correct or not, but in
the next two you will have to enter everything correctly to get
credit.

$BR

Let \(S\) be the statement:
$BITALIC All natural numbers are real numbers.$EITALIC

$BR 

Complete the sentences below, filling in A-G from the following list,
and T or F for true or false, as appropriate.

$BR

$BR$BBOLD A.$EBOLD Numbers aren't natural.

$BR$BBOLD B.$EBOLD All real numbers are natural.

$BR$BBOLD C.$EBOLD Some natural numbers aren't real numbers.

$BR$BBOLD D.$EBOLD Some real numbers aren't natural numbers.

$BR$BBOLD E.$EBOLD No real number is natural.

$BR$BBOLD F.$EBOLD A number can't be natural if it isn't real.

$BR$BBOLD G.$EBOLD A number can't be real  if it isn't natural.

$BR

$BR

\(S\) is  \{ ans_rule(3) \} (true or false).
