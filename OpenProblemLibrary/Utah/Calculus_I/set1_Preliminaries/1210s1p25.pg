TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
City B is 10 miles downstream from city A and on the opposite side of
a river half a mile wide.  Mary will run from city A along the river
for 6 miles, and then swim diagonally (i.e., along a straight line)
across the river to city B.  If she runs at 8 miles per hour and swims
at three miles per hour she will reach City B after
 \{ ans_rule(20) \} hours.  Assume that the current is negligible.

$BR
$BBOLD Note$EBOLD that unless otherwise specified WeBWorK expects your answer to be 
within "one tenth of one percent" of the "true answer" which is the
answer it has been given by the author of the problem.  Practically
speaking this means you should specify at least 4 digits total
(including any before the decimal point).  To be safe, you want to
compute your answer with your calculator much more accurately.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Mary runs 6 miles along the river at 8 miles
per hour.  Her course across the river is the hypotenuse of a right
triangle where the two short sides are half a mile and four miles
long, respectively.  The length of that hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{4^2 +
(1/2)^2}\).
Since she swims at 3 miles per hour the total time \(t\) for her trip is
\[t = \frac{6}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{16+\frac{1}{4}}}{3} \approx
2.094\hbox{hours}.\]
Mary is quite an athlete!
