The purpose of this problem is to help you prepare for exam 3.  Some
of the exam questions will not have been covered by the time this home
work set opens (but of course they will be covered before the exam).

Here is a list of topics.  Make sure you understand everything about
them.

$BR

$BR Finding indefinite integrals (antiderivatives).  On the test,
don't forget the integration constant!  To try your hand, enter here 
any particular indefinite integral of 
\(f(x) = \sin x \cos x\) (without the integration constant).
$BR
\(\int\sin x \cos x \hbox{d}x = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}.


$BR Collapsing sums, particularly how to compute them.

$BR Interpreting Riemann Sums as a definite integral.

$BR Evaluating definite integrals

$BR The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

$BR





EOT
$antideriv = "(sin(x)**2)/2";

ANS(fun_cmp($antideriv, mode=>"antider"));
