This problem demonstrates a WeBWorK True/False question. $PAR
Enter a T or an F in each answer space below
to indicate whether the corresponding statement is true or
false.$BR
You must get all of the answers correct to receive credit.

## First we set up our variables.
$a = random(1,5,1);
$b = random(6,10,1);
$c = random(-10,-1,1);
$d = random(-10,-1,1);
$e = random(1,10,1);

$questStr1 = EV2(" \(-$a \lt -$b\)");
$ansStr1 = "F";
$questStr2 = EV2(" \($c \leq $c\)");
$ansStr2 = "T";
$questStr3 = EV2(" \($d \lt $d\)");
$ansStr3 = "F";
$questStr4 = EV2(" \(\pi \geq 3.1416\)");
$ansStr4 = "F";
$questStr5 = EV2(" \($e-1 \leq $e\)");
$ansStr5 = "T";

@questions =( $questStr1,$questStr2,$questStr3,$questStr4,$questStr5);
@answers =( $ansStr1,$ansStr2,$ansStr3,$ansStr4,$ansStr5);

## Now choose randomly 4  questions out of the 5 question strings above.

@slice = NchooseK(scalar(@questions),4);

## Next we output the 4 chosen questions.  #match_
TEXT(
&match_questions_list(@questions[@slice])
);

ANS(str_cmp([ @answers[@slice] ] ));
TEXT(<<EOT);
$PAR Notice that if one of your answers is wrong then, in this problem, WeBWorK will tell you which
parts are wrong and which parts are right.  This is the behavior for most problems, but for true/false 
or multiple choice questions
WeBWorK will usually only tell you whether or not all the answers are correct.
It won't tell you which ones are wrong.  The idea is encourage you think rather than to just try guessing.
$PAR 
In every case all of the
answers must be correct before you get credit for the problem.
