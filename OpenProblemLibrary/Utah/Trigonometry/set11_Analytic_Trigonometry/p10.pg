TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you are given a triangle where:
\(A=45^\circ\) and \(b=10\).
Then there is one and only one value of \(a\) that is less than \(b\)
and for which there is a unique triangle with the data \(A\), \(a\),
and \(b\).  That value of \(a\) is \{ans_rule(12) \}.

ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(50)));

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Look for a right triangle.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The solution is the right triangle where 
\(B=90^\circ.\).  Since the other two angles are \(45^\circ\) we have 
\(b=c\). By the Pythagorean Theorem, 
\(b^2+b^2 = 2b^2 = a^2 = 100.\)
Thus \(b=\sqrt{50}.\)
