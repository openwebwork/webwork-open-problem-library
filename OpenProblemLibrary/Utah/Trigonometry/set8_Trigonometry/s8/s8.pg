$BR
You are hiking along the west shore of a river that's flowing due north.
You notice a tree on the far shore at a bearing of 30 degrees.  You
walk on for another 100 feet and you are stopped by an unclimbable
cliff.  You contemplate swimming across the river and wonder how wide
it is.  The tree on the other side now appears at a bearing of 45
degrees.  Remembering your trig class, you figure out that the river is
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} feet wide.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  
Again, consider two right triangles.  One of them is isosceles, which
simplifies things.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The situation is described in this Figure:
\{image("p8.gif", height => 500, width => 550);\} $BR We know that
\[\frac{x}{x+100} = \tan 30^\circ.\] Solving for \(x\) as indicated in
the Figure gives \[x= \frac{100 \tan 30^\circ}{1-\tan30^\circ} \approx
136.6'.\] You can swim that far!
