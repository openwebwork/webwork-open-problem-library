TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The diameter of the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion is
approximately 200 million miles.  It's distance from earth is
approximately \(3 \times 10^{15}\) (3 quadrillion) miles (about 507
light years).  It subtends the angle \{ ans_rule(12) \} seconds of
degree.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A penny has a diameter of 0.75 inches.  You figure that Betelgeuse
subtends the same angle as a penny at a distance of \{ ans_rule(12) \} miles.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp($DB*$dP/$dB));

One degree is 3600 seconds of degree.  
For the second part of the problem think in terms of
similar triangles.
