You are on a stationary fishing boat, and you send out your life boat
to retrieve some gear.  The boat moves one nautical mile east, and
then 1.5 nautical miles northeast.  Then it stops.  You can see the
boat at a bearing of \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees

Draw a picture.  Consider two right triangles.  Apply the Pythagorean
Theorem and an inverse trig function.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The solution is indicated in this low tech figure:
\{image("p6.gif", height => 626, width => 501);\} 
There are two right triangles, labeled I and II.  
Triangle I is isosceles, and by the Pythagorean 
Theorem the length of its short side \(y\) equals 
\(y=\frac{3}{\sqrt{8}}\) nautical miles.
Once we know \(y\) we can figure out the length \(d\) of the hypotenuse of triangle II by the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[d=\sqrt{(1+y)^2 + y^2 } = \sqrt{\left(1+\frac{3}{\sqrt{8}}\right)^2 +
\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{8}}\right)^2} \approx 2.318\quad\hbox{nm}.\]
The angle \(\alpha\) in the picture is given by
\[\alpha = \arcsin\frac{y}{d} \approx 27.24^\circ.\]
The bearing \(\beta\), therefore, is
\[\beta= 90^\circ - \alpha \approx 62.76^\circ.\]
