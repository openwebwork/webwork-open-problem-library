TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The diameter of the moon is approximately 2,160 miles. Its average distance
from earth is approximately 236,000 miles.  Consider the angle
\(\theta\) at the
tip of the isosceles triangle formed by your eyes, and the North and
South extremities of the moon.  It is approximately 
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} minutes of degree.    (We say that the moon $BITALIC
subtends $EITALIC the angle \( \theta \).)
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(2*atan(1080/236000)/$pi*180*60));

The diameter of the sun is approximately 864,000 miles. Its average
distance from earth is approximately 92,900,000 miles.  It subtends an
angle of \{ ans_rule(12) \} minutes of degree.
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(2*atan(432/92900)/$pi*180*60));




TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Draw the height in that isosceles triangle and
compute the angle at the top of the triangle.  Multiply with 2.  A
degree has 60 minutes of degree.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Following the hint we see that the angle subtended by the moon is 
\[\theta_{{\hbox{moon}}} = 2\arctan\left(\frac{1080}{236000}\right)\approx
31.46\quad\hbox{minutes of degree}\]
and
\[\theta_{\hbox{sun}} = 2\arctan\left(\frac{432000}{92900000}\right)\approx
31.97\quad\hbox{minutes of degree}.\]

$BR Actually, the orbits of the moon around earth, and that of earth
around the sun are ellipses rather than circles, and so the angles
subtended by these two bodies vary somewhat.  Still, it is
amazing that two such different celestial bodies subtend almost
identical angles (about half a degree) in the Sky.
