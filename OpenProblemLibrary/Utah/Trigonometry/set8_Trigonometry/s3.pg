TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The Great Pyramid of Cheops has a square base with a length of 756
feet.  Its height is 482 feet.  If you walk straight up from the
center of the north side to the top of the pyramid you have to climb
an angle of
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(atan(482/378)/$pi*180));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
You decide to simplify your life and walk up along one of the ridges.
Thus you have to climb only at an angle of
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(atan(482/378/sqrt(2))/$pi*180));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
On your way up the ridge you walk a distance of 
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} feet.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(482**2+756**2/2)));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  For the first two parts draw right triangles
and use an inverse trig function.  For the third part just use the
Pythagorean Theorem. 
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD For the first part consider the right
triangle formed by your starting point, the tip of the pyramid, and
the point directly underneath the tip on the base of the pyramid.
The vertical edge of that triangle forms the the height of the pyramid
and has a length of 482 feet.  The horizontal edge of that triangle
has a length that equals half the length of the base of the pyramid,
i.e., 378 feet.  Thus your climbing angle is
\[\arctan\left(\frac{482}{378}\right) \approx 51.90^\circ.\] If you start 
in
a corner of the base you get another triangle with the same vertical
edge, but a horizontal edge of length \(\sqrt{378^2+378^2}\).
Thus the corresponding angle is 
\[\arctan\left(\frac{482}{\sqrt{378^2+378^2}}\right) \approx 
42.04^\circ.\]
The length \(L\) of the ridge going to the top can be obtained by
applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice.  It is
\[L = \sqrt{378^2+378^2+482^2} \approx 719.8 \quad \hbox{feet}\]
