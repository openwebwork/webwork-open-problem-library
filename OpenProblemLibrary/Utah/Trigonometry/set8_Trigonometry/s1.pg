TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are building a (rectangular) pool in your backyard.  It measures
30m in the north-south direction and 25 meters east-west.  (Some
pool!)  The bottom of the pool is a slanted plane so that it's 1m deep
along the southern edge and 10m deep along the northern edge.  (As I
said, some pool!)  $BR To build the pool you compute the angle of
depression of a line from the southeast corner to the northeast
corner. It is
 \{ ans_rule(24) \}degrees,
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(atan(9/30)/$pi*180));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The line drops by 9 nine meters over the
length of the pool which is 30 meters.  The tangent of the angle of
depression is 9/30.  The angle therefore is
\[\arctan\left(\frac{9}{30}\right) \approx 16.70^\circ.\]
