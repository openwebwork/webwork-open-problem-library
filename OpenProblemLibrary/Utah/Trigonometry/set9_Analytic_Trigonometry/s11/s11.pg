It's a beautiful day for flying your Cessna.  Your instruments
indicate that you are moving at a bearing of 310 degrees and a speed
of 100 knots, both with respect to the surrounding air.  Ground
control tells you that there is a south wind blowing at a speed of 20
knots.  You figure out that your are moving at a bearing of \{
ans_rule(12) \} degrees and a speed of

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The south wind blows from south due north.  Draw
a picture. Think of the south wind broken into two components, one
with a bearing of 310 degrees, and one perpendicular to that bearing.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Proceed as suggested in the hint and
consider this figure:
$BR
\{image("p11.gif", height => 389, width => 527);\} 
$BR

  Let \(y\) be the component of the south
wind in the direction of our nominal bearing of \(310^\circ\), and
let
\(x\) be the component perpendicular to it.   Then
\[x=20 \sin 50^\circ\quad \hbox{and}\quad y = 20 \cos 50^\circ.\]
The wind adds an angle
\[\alpha = \arctan\frac{x}{100+y}\] to our bearing.  By the
Pythagorean Theorem our speed \(v\) is
\[v=\sqrt{(100+y)^2 + x^2}.\]
Plugging these expressions into our calculator gives
\[\hbox{bearing} = 310^\circ + \alpha \approx 317.73^\circ\]
and
\[v \approx 113.89\quad\hbox{knots}.\]
