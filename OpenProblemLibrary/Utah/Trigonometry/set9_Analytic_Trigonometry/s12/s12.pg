TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Consider two fire towers in the Canadian wilderness.  Tower B is 40
miles due East of tower A.  The  guards notice a fire that 
appears at a bearing of 70 degrees from Tower A, and a bearing of 310
degrees from Tower B.

The fire is at a distance \{ ans_rule(12) \} miles from the tower B
(the closer of the two towers).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
The situation is illustrated in this figure:
$BR
\{image("p12.gif", height => 664, width => 501);\} 
$BR
We have a triangle where the angle at tower A is 20 degrees, and the
angle at fire tower B is 40 degrees. Using the notation as indicated
in the Figure we have
\[\frac{h}{y} = \tan 40^\circ\]
and 
\[\frac{h}{x} = \frac{h}{40-y} = \tan 20^\circ.\]

Thus \[y\tan40^\circ = (40-y)\tan20^\circ.\]

This equation can be solved for \(y\) giving
\[y = \frac{40\tan 20^\circ}{\tan 40^\circ + \tan 20^\circ}\]

Hence
\[h =\frac{40\tan 40^\circ\tan 20^\circ}{\tan 40^\circ + \tan
20^\circ}\]
and, finally, the distance \(d\) from tower B to the fire is

\[d= \sqrt{y^2+h^2 }\approx 15.80 \quad\hbox{miles.}\]
