WeBWorK has the usually useful feature that it will not distinguish
between any equivalent expressions. For example if I asked you to
express \(\sin^2 x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), and told ww that the
correct answer is \(1- \cos^2 x\), then WeBWorK would be just as happy if
you typed \(sin^2 x\), and so bypassed the entire problem!

$BR

To finesse this feature we have to do something contrived.  In each of
the next few problems I will tell you to use a different variable for
certain things.

$BR Here is an easy warm up question and illustration:

$BR

Use \(C\) to denote \(\cos x\), and express \(\sin^2 x \) in terms of
\(C\): \(\sin^2(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(12) \}.  $BR Since
\(\sin^2x+\cos^2 x = 1\), in this case you would of course enter
\[1-C^2\] as your answer. You can type it, for example, as $BITALIC
1-C**2 $EITALIC.  If you feel adventurous 
you can also type 
$BITALIC (1-C)(1+C), $EITALIC but you must use \(C\) instead of \(\cos 
x\)!

$BR
Note that $BBOLD mathematics and WeBWorK are case sensitive
$EBOLD, so you must use
upper case $BITALIC C $EITALIC in this problem.  For the fun of it you 
might check
the cryptic error message you get when you use a lower case $BITALIC c
$EITALIC or
some other variable!

$BR

Computers are fun!

EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("1-C*C", vars=>["C"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Let's see if you got all this.  Use \(S\) to denote \(\sin x\), and
express \(\cos^2 x \) in terms of \(S\): \(\cos^2(x) = \) \{
ans_rule(12) \}.  


EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("1-S*S", vars=>["S"]));
