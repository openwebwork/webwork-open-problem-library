TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Sometimes, however, things are simpler than they appear.
Using the results of the preceding problem, simplify as much as possible:
$BR
 \((1-\sin x)(1+\sin x)(1+\tan^2(x)) = \) \{ ans_rule(12) \}
EOT

ANS(num_cmp( 1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
This is a little more tricky:
Simplify as much as possible:
$BR
\(\sin^4x - \cos^4 x-\sin^2x +\cos^2x = \)
\{ ans_rule(12) \}
EOT

ANS(num_cmp( 0));
