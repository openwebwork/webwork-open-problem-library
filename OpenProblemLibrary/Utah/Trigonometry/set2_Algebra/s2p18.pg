TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Quadratic equations do not always occur 
in standard form.  Sometimes they have to be converted to standard
form using our basic 
principle of doing the same thing on both sides to get where we
want to go.

The equation \[x+\frac{1}{x} = 2\] has only one solution.  It is
$BR\(x=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \}.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
When you see the solution you will say "of course".  As
a first step, multiply with \(x\) on both sides.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Multiplying with \(x\) on both sides of the equation gives \[x^2+1 =
2x.\] Subtracting \(2x\) on both sides gives \[x^2 - 2x +1 = (x-1)^2 =
0.\] Hence \(x=1\).  We check this by substituting \(x=1\) in the
original equation.  It works!
