TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The first few problems in this set are meant to help you recognize and
avoid common pitfalls in doing algebra.  For each statement below
enter a $BITALIC T$EITALIC (true) if the statement is true and an $BITALIC F$EITALIC (false)
otherwise.  In this problem WeBWorK will tell you for each answer if
it's correct, but don't just try out the possibilities, make sure you
understand why the statement is true or false.  (In the following problems
you will have to get everything right before you get credit.)


$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} For all real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \[a+b = b+a.\]
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("T"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} For all positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), 
\[\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = a+b.\]
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("F"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR   \{ ans_rule(4) \} For all positive real numbers \(a\) 
\[a^0=1.\]

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$BR 
$BR \(a+b = b+a\) for all real numbers \(a\) and
\(b\).  This is $BITALIC the commutative law of addition.$EITALIC  
$BR
\(\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = a+b.\) only if \(a\) or \(b\) is zero.  For example, if
\(a=b=1\) we get \[\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \sqrt{2} \neq 2 = 1+1.\] 
$BR
\(a^0=1\) because if we defined it any other way we would not have the
property \[a^ma^n = a^{m+n} \] which follows from the definition of
powers when \(m\) and \(n\) are natural numbers.
