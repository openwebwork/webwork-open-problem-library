The next few problems will ask you to solve quadratic equations.
Some such equations can be solved by factoring, but most require that
you complete the square or apply the quadratic formula.  As you know,
I recommend that you complete the square, because most people cannot
remember the quadratic formula correctly and permanently. 

$BR When asked to enter numbers in increasing sequence remember that a
number \(b\) is larger than a number \(a\) if \(a\) is to the left 
of \(b\) on the number line.  So, for example, \(1\) is larger than
\(-10000\).
When the answers involve square roots, like \(1+\sqrt{5}\), you can
compute and enter decimal approximations, but it's easier to enter an
expression like $BITALIC 1+sqrt(5). $EITALIC




The equation \[x^2+2x-3 = 0 \] has two solutions.  Enter the smaller

and the larger here
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
