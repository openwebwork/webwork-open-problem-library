$BR
The solution of the equation
\[ \frac{1}{x-$a} = \frac{2}{x+$b} \]
$BR
is \(x = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
EOT

$answer = 2*$a+$b;


ANS(num_cmp($answer));

$a2=2*$a;

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Take reciprocals on both sides.
EOT


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We start by taking the reciprocal on both sides
of the equation.  This gives the equivalent equation
\[x-$a = \frac{x + $b}{2}.\]
Multiplying with \(2\) on both sides gives
\[2x-2\times $a = {x + $b}.\]
Subtracting \(x\) and adding \(2\times $a = $a2\) on both sides gives
\($answer = x. \)
EOT
