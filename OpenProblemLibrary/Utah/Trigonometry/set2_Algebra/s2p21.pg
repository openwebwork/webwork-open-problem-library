You are on a pleasure cruise through the universe and you crash in the
ocean of an unknown planet.  Your spaceship floats on the water and
its top is $h feet above the surface of the water.  You swim away from
the spaceship until you see its top on the horizon.  Your laser range
meter tells you that your eyes are $d miles away from the top of the
space ship. (You are a capable--if reckless and curious--swimmer.)
The radius of the planet is \{ ans_rule(10) \} miles.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let \(r\) denote the radius of the planet, \(d\) the distance
between your eyes and the top of your ship, and \(h\) the height of your
ship above the water.  Consider the right triangle formed by your
eyes, the top of your space ship, and the center of that planet.  Its
sides have length \(r\), \(r+h\), and \(d\).  Thus, by the Pythagorean
Theorem, \[(r+h)^2 = d^2+ r^2.\] We know \(d\) and \(h\), and we
want to compute \(r\).  So we solve this equation for \(r\): 
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
(r+h)^2 &=& d^2+ r^2 \\
r^2 + 2rh + h^2 &=& d^2+r^2 \\
2rh + h^2 &=& d^2 \\
 2rh &=& d^2 -h^2\\ 
 r &=& \frac{d^2-h^2}{2h}
\end{array}
\] 
On your particular planet, measuring
everything in miles, we obtain \[r = \frac{$d^2 - \left(\frac{$h}{5280}
\right)^2} {2 \times \frac{$h}{5280} } \approx
$rint~\mbox{miles.}\]
