 The essence of algebra is the manipulation of algebraic expressions.
One application of algebraic expressions is the statement of formulas
that describe general facts.  The next few questions will ask you to
enter some simple algebraic expressions.  Just enter them like you
might type them on paper, without quotation marks, using the basic four
operations, a double asterisk to denote exponentiation, and ``pi''
(without the quotation marks) to denote \(\pi\).

$BR


Enter here \{ans_rule(20) \} an algebraic expression that gives the
area of a rectangle with a length of \(a\) and a width of \(b\).  (Use
an asterisk to denote multiplication.)
