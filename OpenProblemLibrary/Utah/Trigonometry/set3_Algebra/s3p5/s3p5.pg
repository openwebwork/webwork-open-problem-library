TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider again the function  \[f(x)=x^2.\]  
The Figure 
$BR
\{image("p5a.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
shows the graphs of \(f\) and also the graphs of
\[g_1(x) = 2x^2 \quad\hbox{and}\quad g_2(x) = \frac{x^2}{2},\]
which are obtained by scaling the graph of \(f\) vertically by a factor 
\(2\) or \(1/2\), respectively.  

The graph in this Figure is obtained from that of \(f\) by a combination
of scaling and shifting:
$BR\{image("p5b.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
It is the graph of the function
$BR
\(g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(15)\}

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Figure out the scale by going \(1\) unit to the right from the vertex,
and see what happens to the function value.  Consider the location of
the vertex.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The vertex of the modified function is at \((-1,-1)\).
When \(x=0\) then \(g(x) = 1\), which is \(2\) more than
\(-1\).  The scale factor, therefore, is \(2\).
Hence the Figure shows the graph of the equation
\[g(x) = 2(x+1)^2 -1 = 2x^2+4x+1.\]
Either form can be entered into WeBWorK.
