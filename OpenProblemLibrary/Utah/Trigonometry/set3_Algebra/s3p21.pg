TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You have a 5 foot long ladder, and you lean it against a wall such
that the bottom of the ladder is 3 feet away from the wall.  The top
of the ladder touches the wall at a height of \{ ans_rule(5) \} feet.

ANS(num_cmp(4));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD


$BR
The ladder, the piece of the wall from the
floor to the top of the ladder, and the horizontal piece of the floor
from the wall to the bottom of the ladder form a right triangle whose
hypotenuse has length 5, and one side has length 3.  Let's say the
third side has length \(x\).  Since the long side has length \(5\)
we know that 
\[x^2+3^2=25\]
and hence
\[x^2 = 25 - 9 = 16 \qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad x = 4.\]
The ladder touches the wall at a height of four feet.
