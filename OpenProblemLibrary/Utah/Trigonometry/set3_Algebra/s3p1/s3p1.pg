TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider the function  \[f(x)=x^2.\]  Its graph is the standard parabola shown 
in this Figure:
$BR
\{image("p1a.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR

The graph in this Figure 
$BR\{image("p1b.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
has been obtained by shifting the first graph one unit to the right,
and one unit down.  (Don't get confused by the fact that the scales on
the two axes are different.)  It is the graph of the function
$BR
\(g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(15)\}
EOT


ANS(fun_cmp("(x-1)**2-1", vars=>["x"]));
 
TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Ask what happens to the vertex of the graph.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The vertex of the modified function is at \((1,-1)\).
To move it there we replace \(f(x) = x^2\) with
\[g(x) = (x-1)^2 -1 = x^2-2x.\]
Either form can be entered into WeBWorK.
