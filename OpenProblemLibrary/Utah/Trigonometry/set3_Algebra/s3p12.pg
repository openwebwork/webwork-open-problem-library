TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
An $BITALIC isosceles triangle$EITALIC is one where two sides have the same
length and the third side has a possibly different length.
Suppose you have an isosceles triangle where two sides have length 
\(a\) and the base has length \(b\).  Then the height of that triangle is
\(h=\)  \{ ans_rule(24) \}.
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt(a**2-b**2/4)", limits=>[[4,5],[1,2]], vars=>["a","b"]));

The area of your triangle is
\(A=\)  \{ ans_rule(24) \}.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Draw the right triangle and its height.  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.
Use \(sqrt(...)\) to enter the square root of something.  The area of
a triangle is one half times base times height.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Denote the height by \(h\).  It forms a right triangle where the other
short side has length \(a\) and   the hypotenuse has length \(b\).  Thus
\(h\) satisfies the equation
\[h^2+\frac{b^2}{4} = a^2\]
which has the solution \[h=\sqrt{a^2-\frac{b^2}{4}}.\]
Substituting in the area formula for the triangle we obtain
\[A=\frac{b}{2}h = \frac{b}{2}\sqrt{a^2-\frac{b^2}{4}}.\]
