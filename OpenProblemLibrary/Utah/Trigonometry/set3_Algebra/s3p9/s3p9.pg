The Figure
$BR
\{image("p9a.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
shows the $BITALIC unit circle$EITALIC, i.e., the circle around the origin with radius \(r=1\).
It is defined by the equation \[x^2+y^2=1.\]
As with any equation, other circles can be obtained by scaling and shifting.
The circle in this Figure 
$BR\{image("p9b.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
is the graph of the equation

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Obtain from the Figure the center and the radius of the circle, and
then write down the standard equation of the circle.  Notice that some
of your results may be negative.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The center of this circle is at \(2,-3\) and its radius is 2.  Thus the
standard form of its equation is
\[(x-2)^2 + (x+3)^2 = 2^2.\]
