Consider the circle with the equation
\[(x-3)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 49.\]
Its center is

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
The circle with radius \(r\) and center \((x_C,y_C)\) is the 
set of all points that are at a distance \(r\) from the center.  It is
the graph of the equation
\[(x-x_C)^2+(y-y_C)^2 = r^2.\]

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
For the equation
\[(x-3)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 49.\]
to match the standard equation of a circle
\[(x-x_C)^2+(y-y_C)^2 = r^2\]
we have to have 
\[x_C=3,\quad y_c=5,\quad\hbox{and}\quad r=\sqrt{49}=7.\]
The center of the circle is \((3,5)\) and its radius is
\(7\).
