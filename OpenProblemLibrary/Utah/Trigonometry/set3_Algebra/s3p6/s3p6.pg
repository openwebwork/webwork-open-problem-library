TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The graph in this Figure is obtained from that of \(f(x)=x^2\) by a combination
of scaling and shifting:
$BR\{image("p6.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
It is the graph of the function
$BR
\(g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(15)\}
EOT


ANS(fun_cmp("-3*(x-1)**2+4", vars=>["x"]));
 
TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Figure out the scale by going one unit to the right from the vertex,
and see what happens to the function value.  Consider the location of
the vertex.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The vertex of the modified function is at \((1,4)\).
When we go one unit to the right from the vertex we have to go \(3\)
units down to get back to the graph of the function.  The scale
factor, therefore, is -3.  Hence the Figure shows the graph of the
equation
\[g(x) = -3(x-1)^2 +4 = -3x^2+6x+1.\]
Either form can be entered into WeBWorK.
