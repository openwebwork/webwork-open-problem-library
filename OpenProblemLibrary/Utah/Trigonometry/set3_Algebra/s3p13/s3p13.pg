TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Assume you inscribe a regular hexagon inside a circle of radius \(r\),
as shown by the green hexagon in this Figure:

$BR
\{image("hex.gif", height => 320, width => 352);\} 

$BR (The yellow hexagon $BITALIC circumscribes$EITALIC the circle.)

The area of the inscribed hexagon is
\(A=\)  \{ ans_rule(24) \}.
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("3*sqrt(3)/2*r^2", vars=>["r"]));

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
A hexagon is a polygon with six sides.  A regular hexagon is a hexagon
where all sides and all interior angles are equal.  A regular hexagon
inscribed in a circle is the largest regular hexagon that fits in the
circle.  Think of the hexagon as consisting of 6 equilateral
triangles.  Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle
that you obtained in an earlier problem.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The hexagon consists of 6 equilateral triangles with sides of length
\(r\).  According to an earlier the problem, the area of one of those
triangles is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}r^2.\) Multiplying with \(6\) gives
\[A= 6\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}r^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}r^2\]
for the area of the inscribed regular hexagon.
