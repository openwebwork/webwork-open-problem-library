The graph in this Figure 
$BR\{image("p4.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
$BR
is the graph of the function
$BR
\(g(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(15)\}
EOT


ANS(fun_cmp("-(x-1)**2+1", vars=>["x"]));

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Ask what happens to the vertex of the graph, and
what it means algebraically when we flip the parabola upside down.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The vertex of the modified function is at \((1,1)\).
The parabola is also flipped upside down which 
corresponds to a factor \(-1\) multiplying the perfect square.
Thus the Figure shows the graph of the function
\[g(x) = -(x-1)^2 +1 = -x^2+2x.\] 
Either form can be entered into WeBWorK.
