TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

An $BITALIC equilateral triangle$EITALIC is one where all sides have equal length.
Suppose you have an equilateral triangle where each side is 2 feet long.
Its area is 
\{ ans_rule(12) \} square feet.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(3)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
Actually, we might do a problem like this more generally.
Suppose your equilateral triangle has sides of length \(s\) feet.
Then its area is
\(A=\) \{ ans_rule(24) \} square feet.

$BR (The following similar problems will not have the special case to
begin with.  But if you like work a specific problem first on graph
paper, and measure the distances involved to see if your figuring is
reasonable.)
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt(3)/4*s**2", vars=>["s"]));


 
TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Draw the right triangle and its height.  The area of the triangle
equals of base times height.  You know the base.  Use the Pythagorean
Theorem to figure out the height.  Use \(sqrt(...)\) to enter the square root of something.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Denote the height by \(h\).  It forms a right triangle where the other
short side has length \(s/2\).  The hypotenuse has length \(s\).  Thus
\(h\) satisfies the equation
\[h^2+\frac{s^2}{4} = s^2\]
which has the solution \[h=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s.\]
Substituting in the area formula for the triangle we obtain
\[A=\frac{1}{2}\times s\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2.\]
