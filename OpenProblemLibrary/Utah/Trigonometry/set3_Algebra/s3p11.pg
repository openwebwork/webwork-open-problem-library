BEGIN_TEXT
An $BITALIC equilateral triangle$EITALIC is one where all sides have equal length.
Suppose you have an equilateral triangle where each side is 2 feet long.
Its area is 
\{ ans_rule(12) \} square feet.
END_TEXT
ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(3)));

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR
Actually, we might do a problem like this more generally.
Suppose your equilateral triangle has sides of length \(s\) feet.
Then its area is
\(A=\) \{ ans_rule(24) \} square feet.
END_TEXT
ANS(fun_cmp("sqrt(3)/4*s**2", vars=>["s"]));
 
BEGIN_HINT
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Draw the right triangle and its height.  The area of the triangle
equals of base times height.  You know the base.  Use the Pythagorean
Theorem to figure out the height.  Use \(sqrt(...)\) to enter the square root of something.
END_HINT

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Denote the height by \(h\).  It forms a right triangle where the other
short side has length \(s/2\).  The hypotenuse has length \(s\).  Thus
\(h\) satisfies the equation
\[h^2+\frac{s^2}{4} = s^2\]
which has the solution \[h=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s.\]
Substituting in the area formula for the triangle we obtain
\[A=\frac{1}{2}\times s\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2.\]
