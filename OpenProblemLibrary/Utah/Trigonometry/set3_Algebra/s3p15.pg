TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR
Suppose you circumscribe a regular hexagon around a circle of radius
\(r\).  Thus the circle is inscribed the hexagon.  The area of that hexagon is
$BR
\(A=\) \{ ans_rule(24) \} square feet.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("6*r^2/sqrt{3}", vars=>["r"]));


 
TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Use the formula for  the area of an equilateral triangle with a given height, as obtained in an earlier problem.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Think of the hexagon as consisting of \(6\) equilateral triangles of
height \(r\).  As seen earlier, the area of one of those triangles is
\(\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{3}}.\) Multiplying with \(6\) gives the area of the
hexagon: \[A=\frac{6r^2}{\sqrt{3}}= \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}r^2.\] Either form
can be entered into WeBWorK.
