TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
You are walking in a city.  You are 6 feet
tall and you cast a shadow that's 8 feet long.  You notice that one of
the buildings casts a shadow that's 160 feet long.  The height of that
building is  \{ ans_rule(10) \}  feet.

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD this is the first problem in this class to come with a
$BBOLD Hint$EBOLD.  
Many problems in this class will have hints.  Most problems
will also have $BBOLD solutions$EBOLD that you can see after the set closes.
(Click on "Show Solution" and once again submit an answer---but
remember that this works only after the deadline for this set.)  After
the deadline you can also see the "answers" of a question which are
the numbers (or words or choices) that WeBWorK expects you to enter.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD 
Draw a couple of similar triangles.  Assign a variable to the unknown
height, write down an equation involving that variable, and solve the
equation for the variable.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We know that in similar triangles ratios of
corresponding sides are equal.  Denoting the unknown height by \(h\) we
obtain that \[\frac{6}{8} = \frac{h}{160}\] Multiplying with \(160\)
on both sides gives: \[h = \frac{6}{8} \times 160 = 120.\] The height
of the building is 120 feet.
