This figure 
$BR
\{image("p6.gif", height => 300, width => 500);\} 
$BR
shows the graph of the function 
$BR
\(f(x) = \) \{ans_rule(24) \}
$BR
Your answer may be of the form \(f(x) = a\sin(bx+c)\) where \(a\),
\(b\), and \(c\) are small integers or \(\pi\).  

$BR
In the actual exam you will also be asked to draw a graph with a given
function, but a problem like that is difficult to
put into WeBWorK.
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
