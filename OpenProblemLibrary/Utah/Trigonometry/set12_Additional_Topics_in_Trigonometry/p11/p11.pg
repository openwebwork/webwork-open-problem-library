TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose the speed of the wind is \(w\), the speed of the plane is \(p\), and the
ground speed is \(g\).  Let \(A\) denote the angle you plane needs to
make with the wind,  and \(B\) the angle that the wind makes with your
desired direction of travel, as illustrated in this Figure:
$BR
\{image("p11.gif", height =>148, width => 419);\}

{\bf For simplicity assume that the angles are measured in radians so that
you can use the WeBWorK trig functions and their inverses without
conversion.} 

Then
$BR
\(A=\) \{ans_rule(36) \}.

$BR
Your answer will be a mathematical expression in \(B\), \(p\) and \(w\).
$BR Once you have the angle \(A\) you can compute your ground speed using either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 

$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The law of sines gives
\[A=\arcsin\frac{w\sin B}{p}\]
and the law of cosines gives
\[g=\sqrt{p^2+w^2-2pw\cos(\pi-A-B)}.\]
