Calculating the necessary aircraft heading to counter a wind velocity
and proceed along a desired bearing to a destination is a classic
problem in aircraft navigation. It makes good use of the law of sines
and the law of cosines.

Suppose you wish to fly in a certain direction relative to the ground.
The wind is blowing at 50mph at an angle of 40 degrees to that
direction.  Your plane is flying at 100mph with respect to the
surrounding air.  The situation is illustrated in this Figure (where
your desired direction of travel is due East):


\{image("p10.gif", height =>195, width => 518);\}


Then you head into the wind at an angle of


$BR
\{ans_rule(12) \} degrees (enter your value of \(\alpha\)),

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(asin(50*sin(40/180*$pi)/100)/$pi*180));

and your ground speed is 
\{ans_rule(12) \} miles per hour (enter your value of \(x\)).
EOT

$beta=40/180*$pi;
$alpha= asin(50*sin($beta)/100);
$gamma = $pi-$alpha-$beta;
$v=sqrt(50**2+100**2-2*50*100*cos($gamma));
ANS(num_cmp($v));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Apply the Law of Sines to get the angle
\(\alpha\) and the law of cosines to get the ground speed.  
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The law of sines tells us that
\[\frac{\sin\alpha}{50} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{100}.\]
Thus 
\[\alpha = \arcsin\frac{50\sin40^\circ}{100} \approx 18.74^\circ.\]
Let \(x\) denote the ground speed. that
The law of cosines tell us
\[x=\sqrt{50^2+100^2-2\times 50 \times 100 \times\cos(180^\circ-\alpha - 40^\circ)}
\approx 133~\hbox{mph}\]

These results are consistent with our drawing.
