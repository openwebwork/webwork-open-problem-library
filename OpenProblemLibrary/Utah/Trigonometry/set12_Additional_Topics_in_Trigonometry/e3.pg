$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Its
focus will be on solving triangles.  A triangle has three sides and
three angles.  The awkward phrase "solving a triangle" means given
three of those data, find the other three.  (It may also include
finding other quantities, like finding some or all of the heights, or
finding the area.)  $BR In this problem, as usual, the angles are
labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), and the sides opposite these angles
have lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), respectively.  In abstract
problems the lengths aren't specified in any particular units, but we
assume that the units are same for all lengths involved.
We can distinguish a number of cases for the three given data.  For
each cases we proceed differently.  The cases are:

$BR

$BR $BBOLD abc$EBOLD. Three sides and no angles are given.  In that case
any two sides have to add up to more than the third side.  (For
example, there is no triangle for which two sides are one foot long,
and the third has a length of one mile.)  If so there is a unique triangle
with those three sides.  You can find the angles using the Law of
Cosines.  For example, suppose \[a=3,\quad b=4,\quad c=6.\] Then $BR
\(B=\) \{ans_rule(12) \}degrees.  (You can compute \(A\) and \(C\)
similarly.)  

EOT

ANS(num_cmp(acos((9+36-16)/2/3/6)/$pi*180));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

$BR$BBOLD Axy$EBOLD One angle and two sides are given.
There are two subcases:

$BR

$BR $BBOLD abC$EBOLD The two sides make up the angle.  There is a unique
triangle.  Find the opposite side using the law of cosines.  Then find
the other angles using the either the law of sines or the law of
cosines. For example, suppose 
\[a=3,\quad b = 4, \quad C= 40^\circ.\]
Then \(c=\) \{ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(3**2+4**2-2*3*4*cos(40/180*$pi))));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


$BR $BBOLD abA$EBOLD One of the sides is opposite the angle.  Apply the law
of sines.  There are several subcases:

$BR 
$BR \(a\) is too small, there is no solution.  
$BR \(a\) is just large enough so that there is a unique right triangle.
$BR \(a< b\) but it's large enough so that there are two triangles.
$BR \(a=b\) There is one isosceles triangle. 
$BR \(a > b\) There is a unique triangle.

$BR 

For example, suppose \(A=40^\circ\) and \(b=5\).
Then there will be no triangle if 
\(a < \) \{ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT

$critical = 5*sin(40/180*$pi);
ANS(num_cmp($critical));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
 If in fact \(a\) equals that critical value then
\(c=\) \{ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT

$ccrit=$critical/tan(40/180*$pi);
ANS(num_cmp($ccrit));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

If \(a\) is greater than that critical value, but less than \(5\), for example, if \(a=4\),
then there are two triangles, with two possible values of \(B\).
The smaller of these two values is 

\(B=\) \{ans_rule(12) \} degrees
EOT

$B=asin(1.25*sin(40/180*$pi))/$pi*180;
ANS(num_cmp($B));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

and the larger is  \{ans_rule(12) \} degrees.

EOT

ANS(num_cmp(180-$B));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

$BR

$BR $BBOLD ABx.$EBOLD If we know two angles then we know all three angles.
Given two angles and one side we can use the Law of Sines to find all
sides, and there is unique angle.  Of course the given two angles need
to add to less than 180 degrees, otherwise there is no triangle.
For example, if \[A=30^\circ, \quad B=80^\circ, \quad c=3,\]
then
\(a\)=  \{ans_rule(12) \}.

EOT

ANS(num_cmp(3/sin(70/180*$pi)*sin(30/180*$pi)));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 



$BR $BBOLD ABC.$EBOLD If we only know three angles (adding to 180 degrees)
and no sides then there are infinitely many triangles with those
angles.  Those triangles are called $BITALIC similar$EITALIC.  They have the
property that ratios of corresponding sides are equal.



$BR

On the exam there will be a problem for each of the above cases, and
one simple word problem involving the solution of a triangle.
