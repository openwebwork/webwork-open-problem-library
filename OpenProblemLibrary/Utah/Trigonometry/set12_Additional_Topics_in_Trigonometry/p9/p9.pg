TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Call the radius of the orange
\(r\), the radius of the melon \(R\), and assume \[r<R.\] Then the
radius of the cone is 
$BR
\{ans_rule(36) \}.
$BR  (Assume all radii are
measured in the same units, e.g., inches.)

Your answer will be a mathematical expression involving \(r\) and
\(R\).  It can be quite long.  You may want to edit it in a separate
window and then cut and paste it into WeBWorK.  However, if you are
ambitious you can simplify it so that it will fit easily into the
given text window.  (The "official" answer that I told ww consists of
just 13 characters. Check the solution for details after the set
closes.)

orange and the melon meet the cone perpendicularly where it touches 
fruit.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We denote the radius of the orange by
\(r\) and the radius of the Melon by \(R\).  Let \(\alpha\) be half the
angle at the tip of the cone, \(x\) the depth of the tip above the
orange, and \(y\) the radius of the cone.  This notation is described
in this Figure

$BR


$BR
We have 
\[\sin \alpha = \frac{r}{r+x} = \frac{R}{R+2r+x}. \]
Taking reciprocals gives
\[\frac{r+x}{r} = \frac{R+2r+x}{R}. \]
Multiplying on both sides with \(r\) and \(R\) gives
\[(r+x)R = (R+2r+x)r.\]
This is a linear equation that can be solved for \(x\):
\[\begin{array}{rclcl}
(r+x)R &=& (R+2r+x)r &|& \hbox{distribute} \\
rR+xR &=& Rr + 2r^2+xr &|& - Rr - xr \\
xR - xr &=& 2r^2 &|& \hbox{factor} \\
x(R-r) &=& 2r^2 &|& \div (R-r) \\
x &=& \frac{2r^2}{R-r} \\
\end{array}
\]

$BR
To find the radius of the cone first note that 
\[\alpha = \arcsin\frac{r}{x+r}.\]
Moreover,
\[\frac{y}{2(R+r)+x} = \tan \alpha.\]
Thus
\[y = (2(R+r)+x)\tan \left(\arcsin\frac{r}{x+r}\right).\]

Substituting for \(x\) gives

\[y = (2(R+r)+\frac{2r^2}{R-r})\tan \left(\arcsin\frac{r}
{\frac{2r^2}{R-r}+r}\right).\]

$BR
This expression can be entered into WeBWorK,
for example as
$BR
$BITALIC (2(R+r)+(2r**2)/(R-r))*tan(asin(r/((2r**2)/(R-r)+r))) $EITALIC


$BR However, you may be amazed to see how much this expression can be
simplified.  In the following, \(\times A\) means multiply numerator
and denominator with \(A\).

\[
\begin{array}{rclcl}
y &=& (2(R+r)+x)\tan\arcsin\frac{r}{x+r} &|& \tan = \sin/\cos \\ \\
&=& (2(R+r)+x)\frac{\sin\arcsin\frac{r}{x+r}}
{\sqrt{1-\sin^2\arcsin\frac{r}{x+r}}}&|& \sin\arcsin u = u \\ \\
&=& (2(R+r)+x)\frac{\frac{r}{x+r}}
{\sqrt{1-(\frac{r}{x+r})^2}}&|& \times (x+r) \\ \\
&=& \frac{(2(R+r)+x)r} {\sqrt{(x+r)^2 - r^2}}&|& \hbox{simplify} \\ \\
&=& \frac{2Rr+2r^2+xr} {\sqrt{(x^2+2rx}}&|& x=\frac{2r^2}{R-r} \\ \\
&=& \frac{2Rr+2r^2+\frac{2r^3}{R-r}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{2r^2}{R-r}\right)^2
+\frac{4r^3}{R-r}}} &|& \times (R-r) \\ \\
&=& \frac{(2Rr+2r^2)(R-r)+2r^3}{\sqrt{4r^4+ 4r^3(R-r)}} 
&|& \hbox{simplify} \\ \\
&=& \frac{2R^2r+2r^2R-2Rr^2-2r^3+2r^3}{\sqrt{4r^4+4r^3R-4r^4}} 
&|& \hbox{simplify more} \\ \\
&=& \frac{2R^2r}{2r\sqrt{Rr}} &|& \hbox{cancel \ } 2r \\ \\
y&=& \frac{R^2}{\sqrt{Rr}} &|& \hbox{very simple!} \\ \\
\end{array}
\]

So instead of the lengthy expression above you can also just enter

$BR
$BITALIC R*R/sqrt(R*r) $EITALIC

(Try it, cut and paste this into the answer field.)

$BR If you are still curious about this problem figure out the
significance of our assumption \(r<R\).  What happens if \(r>R\)? What
if \(r=R\)?  Email me your explanations!
