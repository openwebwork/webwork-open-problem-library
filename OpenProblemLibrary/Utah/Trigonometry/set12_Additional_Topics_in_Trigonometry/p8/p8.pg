TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You have a cone shaped bag. At the bottom of the bag is an orange with
a radius of 2 inches.  On top of the orange is a melon with a radius
of 6 inches.  It touches the orange and fits snugly in the bag,
touching it in a ring around the orange.  Its top is at the same 
level as the top of the bag. All of this is illustrated in this crude figure:

The height of the cone is

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let's denote the radius of the orange by
\(r\) and the radius of the Melon by \(R\).  Let \(\alpha\) be half the
angle at the tip of the cone, \(x\) the depth of the tip below the
orange, and \(y\) the radius of the cone.  This notation is described
in this Figure

$BR
We have 
\[\sin \alpha = \frac{r}{r+x} = \frac{R}{R+2r+x}. \]
Taking reciprocals gives
\[\frac{r+x}{r} = \frac{R+2r+x}{R}. \]
Multiplying on both sides with \(r\) and \(R\) gives
\[(r+x)R = (R+2r+x)r.\]
This is a linear equation that can be solved for \(x\):
\[\begin{array}{rclcl}
(r+x)R &=& (R+2r+x)r &|& \hbox{distribute} \\
rR+xR &=& Rr + 2r^2+xr &|& - Rr - xr \\
xR - xr &=& 2r^2 &|& \hbox{factor} \\
x(R-r) &=& 2r^2 &|& \div (R-r) \\
x &=& \frac{2r^2}{R-r} \\
\end{array}
\]

$BR
This tells us the height of the cone:
\[\hbox{height} = 2R+2r+x = 18.\]

$BR
To find the radius of the cone first note that 
\[\alpha = \arcsin\frac{r}{x+r}.\]
Moreover,
\[\frac{y}{2(R+r)+x} = \tan \alpha.\]
Thus
\[y = (2(R+r)+x)\tan \left(\arcsin\frac{r}{x+r}\right).\]
This is enough information to compute \(y\).  It equals approximately
10.39 inches which is consistent with the pictures.

$BR
See the solution of the next problem for a simplification of the above
expression.
