TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BITALIC Orienteering$EITALIC is a sport in which competitors use a map and a
compass to find their way through unfamiliar terrain.  Your task to is
to travel along a triangular course.  The first leg is due west, and
6,000 meters long.  The other two legs are north of the first leg.
The second leg is 4,000 m long, and the third leg is 5,000 meters
long.  Your compass bearing (the direction in which you are moving)
during the second leg is \{ans_rule(12) \}degrees
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
$bearing= 90-acos((4**2+6**2-5**2)/2/4/6)/$pi*180;
ANS(num_cmp($bearing));

$BR During the third leg of your course your bearing is 
\{ans_rule(12) \}degrees.
$BR Enter your answers with at least 2 digits beyond the decimal point.
