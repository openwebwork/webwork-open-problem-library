TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));


This problem outlines how Eratosthenes of Cyrene approximated the
diameter of the earth in approximately 200BC.  By observing the shadow
of the sun at noon he recognized that his home town of Alexandria was
approximately \(7.2^\circ\) north of the town of Syene.  He paid
somebody to walk and measure the distance between Syene and
Alexandria.  Suppose it is 787 km.  Based on these figures, the
circumference of the earth is  \{ ans_rule(12) \} kilometers.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Observe that \(7.2^\circ\) is to 360 degrees as walking 787 km is to
walking the entire circumference.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Following the hint, and denoting the circumference by \(c\),  we have the 
equation
\[\frac{7.2}{360} = \frac{787}{c}.\]
Solving for \(c\) gives
\[c = \frac{360\times 787}{7.2} = 39,350\hbox{~km}.\]

$BR
The modern value is a little over 40,000km. Indeed, the French
originally defined one meter to be 1/10,000,000 of one quarter around
the equator. If there measurements had been exact, the circumference of
the earth around the equation would be 40,000km.  Their instruments
and techniques weren't as accurate as modern devices.  Also the earth
is not spherical, its North South circumference is a little less than
the length of the equator.
