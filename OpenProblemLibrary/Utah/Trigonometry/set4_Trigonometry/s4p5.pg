TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Occasionally you may encounter an angle that's given in the old fashioned 
degrees/minutes/second form, as described in the box on page 286 of
the textbook. A degree is divided into 60 minutes (or minutes of
degree), and a minute (of degree) is divided into 60 seconds.

$BR Let \[a=3^\circ 5' 17''.\]
Then 
\(a= \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees (in decimal notation) 
EOT
$b=3+5/60+17/3600;
ANS(num_cmp($b));



TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
and
\(a= \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} radians.
$BR
Again, enter your answers showing at least 4 digits.
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp($b/180*$pi));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
One minute is 1/60 of a degree, and 1 second is 1/3600 of a degree.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
\[a=\left(3 + \frac{5}{60} + \frac{17}{3600}\right)^\circ\approx 3.0881^\circ \approx 0.05390\hbox{~rad}.\]
EOT
