You can answer some of these questions simply by keying things into 
your calculator.  However, the purpose of these problems is to help you 
get familiar with the definitions of the basic trigonometric functions, 
and to improve your ability to work with those definitions. All the 
questions can be answered straight from the definitions of the 
trigonometric functions, perhaps after drawing a simple picture, without 
the aid of a calculator, and I recommend that you don't use one.  Use 'pi' 
to enter the value of \(\pi\) and use $BITALIC
sqrt(...) $EITALIC to enter the square root of something.

$BR
A line drawn from the origin and forming the angle of
\(t=\frac{7\pi}{6}\) with the \(x\)-axis intersects the unit circle at
the point \(\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\right)\).
Complete the following equations:
$BR
\(t=\) \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.

EOT

$BR

\(\cos t = \)\{ ans_rule(12) \}.


EOT

ANS(num_cmp(-sqrt(3)/2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR

\(\sin t = \)\{ ans_rule(12) \}.


EOT

ANS(num_cmp(-1/2));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\tan t = \)\{ ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/sqrt(3)));
