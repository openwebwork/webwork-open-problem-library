TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The diameter of the wheels on your car (including the tires) is 25 inches.  
You are going to drive $d miles today.  Each of your wheels is going
to turn by an angle of \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.



EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
$degs=int($d*12*5280*360/$pi/25+0.5);
ANS(num_cmp($degs));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD A mile has 5280 feet, a foot has 12 inches,
and the circumference of a
circle with a diameter \(d\) equals \(\pi d\).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We need to figure
out the number of times our wheels rotate, as in an earlier problem,
and then multiply with \(360\) to get the angle in degrees.  To get
the number of rotations we convert the distance to inches, and divide
by the circumference of the our wheels, which equals \(25\pi\) inches.
Thus the angle \(x\) that our wheels turn is \[x = \frac{$d\times 5280
\times 12\times 360}{25\pi} = $degs.\]
