TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

We need to be able to convert radians to degrees and vice versa.
Below you can enter radians as decimal approximations, but I recommend that
you enter 
arithmetic expressions like $BITALIC pi/2 $EITALIC
for \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).  I
trust that you can compute a decimal value on your calculator if
required.  However, if you do enter a decimal approximation compute
and enter at least four digits.  WeBWorK will consider your value
correct if it is within one tenth of one percent of the answer that it
has been told.

In this problem WeBWorK will tell you for each answer whether it's
right or wrong, in the next problem you will have to get everything
right before getting credit.

$BR
\(90^\circ = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} rad
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp($pi/2));

$BR
\(60^\circ = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} rad
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($pi/3));

$a=random(1,359,2);

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\($a^\circ = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} rad
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($a/180*$pi));

$a=-random(361,719,2);

$BR
\($a^\circ = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} rad
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($a/180*$pi));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD
Everything follows from the fact that 
\[360^\circ = 2\pi \hbox{~rad}.\]
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
To convert \(x\) degrees to radians use the formula
\[x^\circ = \frac{\pi x}{180} \hbox{~rad}. \]
EOT
