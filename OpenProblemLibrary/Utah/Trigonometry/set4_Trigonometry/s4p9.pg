You travel again in your trusty car with the 25 inch wheels.  You
installed a nifty gadget that measures how often your wheels turn each
hour.  It shows that right now they turn $n times per hour.  You
figure you are going at a speed of
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} miles per hour.  (Round your answer to the nearest
tenth of a mile per hour.)

$pi=2*acos(0.0);
$b = int(10*$n*25*$pi/12/5280+0.5)/10;

ANS(num_cmp($b));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Multiply the circumference of the wheel with the number of rotations per hour.
Convert inches to miles.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
We travel \($n \times 25 \pi\) inches per hour, which 
is \($b\) miles per hour, since a mile has 5,280 feet and a foot has 12 inches.
