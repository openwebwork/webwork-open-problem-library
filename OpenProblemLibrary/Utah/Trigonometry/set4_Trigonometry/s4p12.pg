TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Consider a regular 12 hour clock, and measure time in hours starting from noon.
Let \(m\) denote the angle that the minute hand makes with the top
position (12). Similarly, let \(h\) be the angle that the hour hand
makes with the vertical position.  In this case, suppose we measure
the angle clockwise, so that the angles involved are positive.

$BR

At 2:30pm we have

$BR \(h=\)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(75));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
At that time the minute hand has completed two and half rotations, and
so the angle 
$BR \(m=\)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.  (Enter a number between 
720 and 1080.)
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(900));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
In general, at time \(t\) 
$BR \(h=\)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees, and
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("30t", vars=>["t"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \(m=\)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("360t", vars=>["t"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR

There is a time \(t\) between \(2\) and \(3\) pm  at which the minute
hand is on top of the hour hand.  At that time the hour hand forms an
angle \(x\) of  \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees with the vertical.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(720/11));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Set up and solve an equation for the time where the two hands point in the same
direction, and then multiply the time with 30 to get the required angle.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Clearly, \[m=360t \quad\hbox{and}\quad h = 30t.\]
At the time \(t\) between 2:00 and 3:00 pm where the two hands are on top of
each other, the minute hand has completed and just exceeded 2 full
rotations.   We need to subtract 720 degrees from \(m\) to get the two
angles to agree.  Thus we have to solve the equation
\[360t - 720 = 30t\]
which has the solution \[t = \frac{24}{11}\approx 2.182 \hbox{~hours}.\]
The corresponding angle is 
\[x = \frac{24 \times 60}{11}\approx 65.45\hbox{~degrees}.\]
