TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Positions on earth are defined by their $BITALIC longitude$EITALIC (how far east or west
you are) and $BITALIC latitude$EITALIC (how far north or south you are).  Both
latitude and longitude are angles.  

A $BITALIC nautical mile$EITALIC is one minute of degree of longitude along the
equator.  (A nautical mile is a little more than a regular mile.)
Traveling at \(x\) knots means traveling at \(x\) nautical miles per
hour.

Suppose you fly in a Lockheed SR-71 (the fastest jet ever built) along
the equator at a speed of 1,800 knots (roughly the top speed of the
SR-71).

Ignoring issues of refueling and such, it takes you 
\{ ans_rule(4) \} hours to fly once around the world.  You leave
after breakfast and are back in time for a late dinner. Some airplane!

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Flying once around the equator you cover 360 degrees of longitude.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We travel at 1800 knots, or minutes of
degree per hour.  That's 30 degrees per hour.  To cover 360 degrees of
longitude we travel for 12 hours.
