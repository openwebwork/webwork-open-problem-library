TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Geographic directions are described in degrees, counting clockwise
from a line going due north.  Thus, for example, due north is zero
degrees, east is 90 degrees, and southwest is 225 degrees.

$BR
All distances in this question are measured horizontally as you would
measure them on a map.  You can also think of flying at the altitude
of the peak in question, instead of driving along the highway.  The
direction in which you see the peak is called its $BITALIC bearing$EITALIC.  So a
bearing of 135 degrees means it's southeast of you. Enter your answers
as mathematical expressions (recommended) or as decimal approximations
with at least 4 digits total. 

$BR
You are driving at a constant speed of sixty miles per hour along a
straight road going north.  You see a prominent peak at a bearing of
45 degrees, 
and you know that that peak is 10 miles east of the road. At
this time your distance from the peak is 
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} miles.  
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(10*sqrt(2)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Five minutes later you see the peak at a bearing of 
 \{ ans_rule(24) \}
degrees.
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(atan(2)/$pi*180));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
After another five minutes the peak is due east of you.  At that
precise spot there is a historical marker that tells you about the
peak.  7 minutes after you pass the marker the peak is at a bearing of
\{ ans_rule(24) \} degrees.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(90+atan(7/10)/$pi*180));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You sit back in your car and reflect on the pleasant fact that the
trigonometry class you are taking makes it possible for you to figure out
that \(t\) minutes after you pass the historical marker the bearing of
the peak is \{ ans_rule(24) \} degrees.  (Enter a mathematical
expression involving the variable \(t\).)
EOT

ANS(fun_cmp("90+atan(t/10)/$pi*180", vars=>["t"]));

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Draw a picture.  Think of the Pythagorean Theorem. 60 miles per hour
means a mile a minute.  For the last two parts of this problem think
of the angle you need to add to 90 degrees to get the bearing of the
peak.  You will need to use an inverse trig function.  Remember that
in WeBWorK the inverse trig functions return an angle measured in
radians.  You will need to $BBOLD convert it to degrees.$EBOLD
