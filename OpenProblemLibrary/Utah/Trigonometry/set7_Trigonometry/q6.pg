TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You just took off in your trusty Lockheed SR-71. It's a fine windless
day.  Your instruments indicate a true air speed (speed relative to
the surrounding air) of 400 miles per hour and a climb rate (vertical
speed) of 10,000 feet per minute. You figure that your flight path
makes an angle of \{ ans_rule(24) \} degrees with the horizontal.
(Enter a mathematical expression or a decimal approximation with at
least one digit beyond the decimal point.)

ANS(num_cmp($alpha));
$alpha= int(10*$alpha)/10;



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Draw a triangle showing your ascent and the distance along your flight
path that you travel in one minute.  Apply an inverse trig function.

$hh=int(400*5280/60);
SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
In one minute we climb 10,000 feet.  In that same minute we
cover a distance of 
\[\frac{400\times5280}{60} = $hh \quad\hbox{feet}.\]
Our climb angle  \(\alpha\) is therefore
\[\alpha = \arcsin \left(\frac{10000}{$hh}\right) \approx $alpha^\circ.\]
