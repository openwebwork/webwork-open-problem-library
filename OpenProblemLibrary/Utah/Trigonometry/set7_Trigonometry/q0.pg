TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Let's revisit our clock problem from homework 4.  There is a time
between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock where the hour hand and the minute
hand overlap. Specifically, this happens 
\{ ans_rule(12) \} minutes and
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(10));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(12) \} seconds past 2 o'clock. Enter the seconds as a fraction
(recommended) or with at least two digits beyond the decimal point.
EOT

ANS(num_cmp( 10/11*60));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR At the time that the minute and hour hand overlap, the second hand
forms an angle of \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees with the vertical.
(Remember that in this problem, since we are dealing with a clock, we
measure angles $BITALIC clockwise$EITALIC.  Enter a number between 0 and 360. I
recommend you enter a fraction. Otherwise enter at least one digit
beyond the decimal point.)
EOT

ANS(num_cmp( 3600/11));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Go back to the solution of the previous problem and translate the time you computed there into minutes and seconds.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD As described earlier, the minute and hour
hand overlap at \[t=\frac{720}{330} \quad \hbox{hours.}\] We need to
translate that time into hours, minutes, and seconds.  Subtracting 2
hours from \(t\) leaves us with \(\frac{60}{330}\) hours which is \(
\frac{60\times 60}{330}\approx 10.91\) minutes.  So the number of
minutes asked for in the problem is 10.  Subtracting those 10 minutes
leaves us with \(\frac{300}{330}\) minutes which is \(\frac{300\times
60}{330}= \frac{600}{11} \approx 54.55\) seconds.  Since the second
hand covers 6 degrees per second, at the time \(t\) it makes an angle
of \[\frac{6\times 600}{11} = \frac{3600}{11} \approx 327.3^\circ\]
with the vertical.
