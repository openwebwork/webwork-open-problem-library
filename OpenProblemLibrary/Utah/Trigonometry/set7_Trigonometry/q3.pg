TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are driving along the highway and see a sign indicating that you
are about to enter a downhill slope of 10$PERCENT.  You realize that you are
going to travel downward at an angle of \{ ans_rule(12) \} degrees to
the horizontal. (Enter your answer as a mathematical expression or
with at least two digits beyond the decimal point.)

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(atan(0.1)/$pi*180));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
A descent of 10$PERCENT means that you are going to descend by 1 foot for
every ten feet that you travel in a horizontal direction.  The angle of
your descent is the acute angle that the highway makes with a horizontal
line.  Draw a picture and use an inverse trig function.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We simply compute the inverse tangent of of 0.1, which is approximately 5.71 degrees.
