$v=random(200,400,10);
$h=random(70,80,2);

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are about to land your Cessna airplane in Salt Lake City.  You are
approaching the runway at a ground speed of $h miles per hour and you
are sinking at $v feet per minute. (The ground speed is the speed of
the point on the ground directly underneath your plane.  You can also
think of it as the horizontal component of your current velocity.)
You are going to hit the runway at an angle of \{ ans_rule(24) \} degrees.
(Enter your answer as a mathematical expression, or with at
least three digits beyond the decimal point.)
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
$alpha =atan($v*60/5280/$h)/$pi*180;
ANS(num_cmp($alpha));
$alpha= int(1000*$alpha)/1000;



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Draw a triangle showing your descent and the horizontal distance you
cover in one minute.

EOT

$hh=$h*5280/60;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
In one minute we sink $v feet.  In that same minute we
cover a horizontal distance of 
\[\frac{$h\times5280}{60} = $hh \quad\hbox{feet}.\]
Our angle of approach \(\alpha\) is therefore
\[\alpha = \arctan \left(\frac{$v}{$hh}\right) \approx $alpha^\circ.\]
