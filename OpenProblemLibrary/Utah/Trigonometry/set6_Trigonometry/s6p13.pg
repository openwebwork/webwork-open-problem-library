TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A room measures 12 feet in the North-South direction, 15 feet in the
East-West Direction, and its ceiling is 10 feet high.  Let \(t\) denote the
the angle that the line from the bottom Southeast corner to
the top Northwest corner of the room forms with the floor.  Then
$BR \(\tan t = \)
 \{ ans_rule(24) \}.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  This is much like the box problem on set 3.  
Consider the right triangle formed by the line from the bottom
Southeast corner to the bottom Northwest corner, the line from the
bottom Southeast Corner to the top Northwest corner, and the line
from  the bottom Northwest corner to the top Northwest corner.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Proceed as suggested in the hint.  Let \(a\)
be  the length of the line from the bottom Southeast corner to the
bottom Northwest corner, and \(b\) the length of the vertical line
from the bottom Northwest corner to the top Northwest corner.  By the
Pythagorean Theorem \[a=\sqrt{12^2+15^2} = \sqrt{369}\hbox{~feet},\]
and, obviously, \[b=10\hbox{~feet}.\]
We obtain
\[\tan t = \frac{b}{a} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{369}}\approx  0.520579.\]
