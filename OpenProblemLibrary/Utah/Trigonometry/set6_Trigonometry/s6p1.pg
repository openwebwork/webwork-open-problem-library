TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

One of the interesting aspects of trigonometric functions is that
their representation is not unique.  For example,
we saw in class that \[\cos x = -\cos(x+\pi).\] There are many more so
called $BITALIC trigonometric identities$EITALIC about which we will learn later in
this course.

If functions can be represented differently you may be worried that
you get the right answer, but WeBWorK won't recognize it because it
thinks of a different representation of the answer than you do.

Remember how WeBWorK tests algebraic expressions that you enter: It
evaluates your expression, and the expression that it has been given,
at several random values of the variables, and compares the results.
If they agree it deems your expression correct, no matter how you
wrote it.  So you need not worry about the precise form in which you
enter an answer!


The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate that capability of
WeBWorK, and to reassure you.

Enter here
$BR
  \{ ans_rule(24) \} 
$BR 
the expression \[\cos x\] Write it as $BITALIC
cos(x), $EITALIC or just $BITALIC cos x, $EITALIC and you'll see that 
WeBWorK will accept
your answer.



Now enter  your answer also as
$BR

$BR \(-\cos(x-\pi)\) --- written as $BITALIC -cos(x-pi)
$EITALIC (cut and paste 
this expression),

$BR \(\cos (x+100\pi)\) --- written as $BITALIC cos(x+100*pi),
$EITALIC and

$BR \(\sin \left(x+\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \)  --- written as 
$BITALIC sin(x+pi/2). $EITALIC

$BR

Finally, here's a little hocus-pocus: enter the expression
\[2\cos^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)-1\] (written as $BITALIC
2*cos(x/2)**2-1 $EITALIC ) and notice that as far as WeBWorK (and 
mathematics)
is concerned, this is the same as \(\cos x\).  If you believe this is
a trick question, and ww will simply accept anything in this question,
try it!  Enter anything other than the expressions listed here.  If
you are enterprising, try to come up with some other expressions that
do work.  If you do send me an email!

WeBWorK will accept any and all of these expressions, because they are
all equal  (and the functions defined by them have the same graph).
