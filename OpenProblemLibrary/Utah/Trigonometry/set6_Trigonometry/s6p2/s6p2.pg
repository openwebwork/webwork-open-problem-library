TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In the next few problems all the answers are expressions of the form
\[a\sin(bx-c)+ d \quad\hbox{or}\quad a\cos(bx-c)+ d \] where the
parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) are simple numbers.

$BR Often they are very simple, for example the choice \[a=b=1, \quad
c=d=0 \] in the first expression just gives \(\sin x\).  In any case,
you are not asked to enter values of the parameters, your answers
should be algebraic expression involving the trigonometric functions.

$BR
The graphs may show up more clearly in a browser than on the printed
hard copy of this assignment.

The figure
$BR
\{image("p2a.gif", height => 200, width => 900);\} 
shows the graph of the function
$BR
\(f(x)=\)  \{ ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("sin(x)", vars=>["x"]));
