TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Consider the problem of finding all angles \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\)
such that \[\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}.\] We obtain one such angle by
applying the inverse cos function: \[\theta = \arccos\frac{1}{2} =
\frac{\pi}{3}.\] Note that the function \(f(x) = \cos x\) is symmetric
about the vertical line \(x=\pi\).  Thus the other angle in the given
interval with cos equal to one half is \(\theta = 2\pi-\frac{\pi}{3} =
\frac{5\pi}{3}.\) You can solve problems like this by finding one
solution (using an inverse trig function) and then finding the others
by looking at the graph of the original function or the unit circle.
Try your hand on this problem: There are two angles
\(0^\circ\leq\alpha < 360^\circ\) such that 
\[\sin \alpha = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.\]
The smaller is 
\(\alpha = \) \{ans_rule(12) \} degrees and the larger is

$BR For some particular angles we know exact values of the 
trigonometric functions, and these of course give rise to correspond
statements bout inverse trigonometric functions.  For example we know
that
\[\cos\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{1}{2} ~\Longleftrightarrow~
\arccos\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\pi}{3}.\]
Think about these relationships for the angles 
\(0\), \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), and 
\(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

$BR We are considering only three trigonometric functions, sin, cos,
and tan.  The cos and sin are the coordinates of a point on the unit
circle and tan is the ratio of sin and cos.  Everything flows from
there.  If for a given angle you know any two of sin, cos, and tan,
you can compute the missing value.  For example, suppose you know that 
\[\tan x = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\quad\hbox{and}\sin x =
-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}.\]
$BR
Then \(\cos x = \)
 \{ans_rule(12) \}.

$BR A big subject in trigonometry is $BBOLD trigonometric identities.$EBOLD
There are very many of them, too many to remember. However, they are
highly interdependent, and some are much more important than others.
Easily the two most important are \[\sin^2 u + \cos^2 u = 1\] and
\[\tan u = \frac{\sin u}{\cos u}.\] which flow directly from the
definitions of the trigonometric functions. These two identities are
so basic and used so frequently that by now they should be as familiar
and natural to you as the multiplication table.  Some other identities
like those expressing the facts that the sin and tan are odd, the cos
is even, adding pi to an angle changes the sign of sin and cos, but
not the sin of tan, follow immediately by looking at the unit circle.
Others, like the effects of shifting a graph by \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) left
or right can be easily verified and derived if necessary by looking at
the graphs of the trigonometric functions.  I will assume that you
know or can derive these formulas.  The third tier of identities, like
the sum and difference formulas will be listed on the exam if they are
needed.  Look at the exercises of section 5.2, and do those that only
involve sin, cos, and tan.

$BR $BBOLD Solving trigonometric equations.$EBOLD  The basic principle of
equation solving holds for trigonometric equations just like any
other:  To isolate the variable figure out what bothers you and 
then get rid of it by doing the same thing on both sides of the
equation.  For trigonometric equations you need to apply inverse trig
functions in some places.  Also keep in mind that trigonometric
equations usually have many solutions, and make sure you understand
whether the questions asks for just one solution, all solutions in
some interval, or all solutions.

$BR For example,  measuring angles in radians, the smallest positive number \(x\) such that
\[3\sin(2x-1)=1\]
is
\(x = \)
 \{ans_rule(12) \}.

$BR $BBOLD Graphing functions.$EBOLD We have worked long and frequently
with the graphs of the trigonometric functions.  The inverse trig
functions also have their graphs, and you should be familiar with
them.  Make sure you understand that and how you have to reduce the
domain of or range of some functions to define the inverses of the
trigonometric functions.  There is a problem on the test that involves
the graph of a trig function and its inverse. The solutions show these
graphs in black and white.  Visit the solutions of this problem after
the set closes to see a colored version of those graphs.

$BR A major application area of trigonometric functions is the
geometry of $BBOLD right triangles$EBOLD.  There will be two very simple word
problems taken directly from the textbook.
