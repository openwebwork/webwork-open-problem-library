A ship is moving due
west at 8 knots.  You are in a speed boat \(\sqrt{2}\) nautical miles
directly southeast of the ship.  (Thus your bearing as seen from the
ship is 135 degrees.)  You need to catch up with the ship, and you can
move at a speed of 16 knots.  So you take off at a bearing of \{
ans_rule(24) \} degrees, and you

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD You can solve this particular problem more easily, 
but in order to set up the next problem, which is different for each student, 
I had to consider a more general problem, as
illustrated in this Figure:

\{image("p.gif", height =>200, width => 464);\}

Suppose the ship is moving at a speed \(v_1\) and your boat moves at a
speed \(v_2>v_1\).  Also assume that you bearing from the ship is
\(\beta\) and your distance is \(d\).  Then the direction in which you
move is 270 degrees plus an angle \(\alpha\).  Let \(a\) and \(b\)
denote the east/west and north/south components of your distance from
the ship, as indicated in the Figure.  Furthermore, let \(x\) be the
distance that the ship covers before you catch up with it.  You
yourself cover a distance \[y= \frac{v_2}{v_1} x.\]

We are done if we can figure out the angle \(\alpha\).  So we need to
set up some equations.  We obtain directly from the Figure:

\[a=d \cos\left(\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = d\sin\beta,\]
\[b=d \sin\left(\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -d\cos\beta,\]
and
\[(x+a)^2+b^2 = {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2\]


The third of these equations is a quadratic equation for \(x\), and we
can solve it by completing the square:

\[\begin{array}{rclcl}
(x+a)^2+b^2 &=& {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2  &|& \hbox{expand} \\ \\
x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2 &=& {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2  &|& -{\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2 \\ \\
x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2 - {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2 &=& 0 &|& \hbox{simplify} \\ \\
(1-{\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}) x^2 +2ax + d^2 &=& 0  &|& \times (-1) \\ \\
({\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}-1) x^2 -2ax - d^2 &=& 0  &|& \gamma={\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}-1 \\ \\
\gamma x^2 -2ax - d^2 &=& 0  &|& \div \gamma \\ \\
 x^2 -\frac{2a}{\gamma}x - \frac{d^2}{\gamma} &=& 0  &|& +\frac{d^2}{\gamma}+\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 \\ \\
 x^2 -\frac{2a}{\gamma}x +\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &=& \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &|&\hbox{perfect square}  \\ \\
\left(x-\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &=&  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &|& \sqrt{~~~} \\ \\
x-\frac{a}{\gamma} &=&\pm\sqrt{  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2} &|& + \frac{a}{\gamma} \\ \\
x &=&\frac{a}{\gamma}\pm\sqrt{  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2} &|&  \\ \\
\end{array}
\]

Of these two solutions one is negative (query: why?) and so we need to
consider only the solution with the plus sign:

\[x=\frac{a}{\gamma}+\sqrt{ \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+
\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2}\]

which allows us to compute \(x\) by substituting the expressions 
\(a= d\sin\beta\). 

The time to intercept, \(t\), is given simply by \[t=\frac{x}{v_1}.\]

For this particular problem, 
\[\beta=135^\circ,  \quad d= \sqrt{2},\quad v_1 = 8, \quad v_2=16,\]
and
\[x=1.25, \quad \alpha = 24.30^\circ, \quad t= 9.11\hbox{minutes}.\]

The required bearing is 294.3 degrees.
