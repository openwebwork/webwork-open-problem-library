TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Let \[f(x) = 2x-1\]

$BR
The smallest positive number for which
\[f\left(\cos\left(f(x)\right)\right)=0 \] is \(x=\) \{ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp((1+acos(1/2))/2));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Begin by using the definition of \(f\) to remove 
\(f\) from the equation.  Then solve a linear equation for \(\cos(2x-1)\).  Then solve for \(x\).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Using the definition of \(f\) our equation turns into
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
f\big(\cos\big(f(x)\big)\big)&=& 2\cos(f(x)) -1 \\
&=& 2\cos(2x-1)-1 \\
&=&  0 \\
\end{array}
\]
This can be solved as usual, by isolating the variable in stages:

\[
\begin{array}{rclcl}
 2\cos(2x-1)-1 &=&0 &|& +1 \\ \\
 2\cos(2x-1) &=&1 &|& \div 2 \\ \\
\cos(2x-1) &=&\frac{1}{2} &|& \arccos() \\ \\
2x-1 &=&\arccos\frac{1}{2} &|& +1 \\ \\
2x &=&1+\arccos\frac{1}{2} &|& \div 2 \\ \\
x &=&\frac{1+\arccos\frac{1}{2}}{2} &|& \hbox{the answer} \\ \\
\end{array}
\]

Thus \[x\approx 1.023.\]

This is in fact the smallest positive solution, as can be verified looking at the relevant part of the graph of 
\[y=2\cos(2x-1)-1:\]

\{image("p8.gif", height =>300, width => 300);\}


Note that there is a negative solution close to the origin, but it's
definitely negative since the graph is symmetric with respect to the
line \[x=\frac{1}{2}\] and the solution we computed is (just barely)
larger than 1.
