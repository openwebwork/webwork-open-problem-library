SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  The graph of
\(y=3\sin (2x-5)\) is the graph of \(y=3\sin 2x\) shifted
\(\frac{5}{2}\) units to the right.  So let's find the solutions of
\[3\sin 2x = 1\qquad(*),\] add 2.5 to those, and then go from there.


One solution of \((*)\) is of course
\[x= \frac{1}{2}\arcsin\frac{1}{3}.\]
A key property of the sin function is that
\[\sin (\pi-u) = \sin(u).\]
Thus \[3\sin(2x) = 3\sin(\pi-2x)\]
and solving \[3\sin(\pi-2x) = 1\]
equation gives
\[x = \frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\arcsin\frac{1}{3}.\]

We can obtain all solutions of our original equation \[3\sin(2x-5) =
1\] by adding \(\frac{5}{2}\) and any integer multiple of \(\pi\) to
the solutions of \((*)\).  (We can add integers of \(\pi\) since
\(\sin(2x-5)\) is \(\pi\)-periodic.)  After examining a few
possibilities we find that the smallest positive solution is
\[x=\frac{5}{2}-\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \arcsin\frac{1}{3}.\]

Thus \[x\approx 0.7593.\] This is indeed the smallest positive
solution, as is confirmed by the graphs of \[y=3\sin(2x-5 )
\quad\hbox{and}\quad y=1\] in this Figure:
