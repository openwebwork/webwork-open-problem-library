SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
To begin with we think of \(\cos x\) as our variable.  For clarity let's denote it by \(z\):
\[z= \cos x.\]
Our equation becomes
\[4z^2 -9z+2 = 0. \]
This can be factorized
\[4z^2 -9z+2 =(4z-1)(z-2)=0.\]
Thus \(z=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(z=2\).  There is no number \(x\) whose cosine equals 2, and so the 
only equation we need to solve is 
\[\cos x = \frac{1}{4}.\]
The smallest positive solution of that equation is 
\[x=\arccos\frac{1}{4} \approx 1.318.\]
