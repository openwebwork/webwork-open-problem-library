TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are flying a kite on a line that is \(350\) feet long.  Let's
suppose the line is perfectly straight (it never really is) and it
makes an angle of \(65\) degrees with the horizontal direction.  The
kite is flying at an altitude of \{ ans_rule(21) \} feet.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Consider the right triangle formed by your position, the kite, and
the line vertically down from the kite to the ground.
Let \(h\) denote the unknown height of the kite.  Then 
\[\sin(65^\circ) = \frac{h}{350},\]
i.e.,
\[h = 350 \times \sin(65^\circ) \approx 317.2 \hbox{~feet}.\]
