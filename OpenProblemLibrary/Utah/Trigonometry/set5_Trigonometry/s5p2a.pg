A question like this is unlikely to arise in an application, but we do
need to learn to keep straight the different ways of measuring
angles.

$BR
Suppose you have a triangle in which one angle is \(\frac{\pi}{6}\),
and another is \(40^\circ\).  Then the third angle is
 \{ ans_rule(6) \} degrees, or
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(110));
$pi=2*acos(0.0);

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(12) \} radians. 
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(110/180*$pi));
