The purpose of this problem is to help you prepare for Exam 1.  It
will address some topics that we will cover only after this set opens,
and that therefore you won't be familiar with, but we will cover them in
class before the exam.

The exam will take place on Monday, February 26, during our regular
class session, after the set has closed.

I want to encourage you to work closely with the textbook, and in
particular to make use of the exercises at the end of each section.
Therefore, the problems on the exam will be taken verbatim from the
exercise sets of sections 4.1--6.  (I may use only parts of an
exercise, or combine several exercises into one exam question.)  To
make best use of the exercises I recommend you do the following:

$BR

$BR Before you come to class read the section that we are going to
cover on that day.  You'll be be better able to make sense of the class.

$BR After class go over the section and make sure you understand
what we did in class.

$BR Look at the exercises in the back of the sections.  They divide
into groups.  Do one of each group and decided whether you can handle
the kind of questions in that group.  If you are sure, skip that
group.  If you are not, do some more exercises in that group.  If you
have no clue what the exercises are about go back over your notes and
the section, and figure out what you missed.

$BR Some of the exercises in the textbook involve topics that we did
not cover in class, for example exponential and logarithmic functions.
(Those are covered in Math 1050.)  Don't worry about those problems.
Also, don't worry about cosecant, secant, and cotangent.

$BR

The exam will be closed books and notes, and no electronics.
in degrees.

There will be 11 questions on the exam.  Most are very simple, a
couple are a little more involved.  All questions have equal weight.
You should have plenty of time to do the problems.  Before taking the
exam, read (and heed) the instructions for taking exams on your
syllabus.  In particular, arrive on time, and after you done spend the
remaining time checking your answers.  Don't just rush through the
test to get it over with.

Here is a rundown of the topics covered on the exam.  There will be a
question for each of these topics.  A few similar questions are part of
this WeBWorK problem.

$BR 

$BR Know how to sketch an angle that is given in degrees or radians.

$BR Given an angle, know how to estimate it in degrees or radians. 

$BR Know how to convert an angle from degrees to radians.


For example, 
$BR
\(300^\circ = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} rad
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0); 
ANS(num_cmp(300*$pi/180));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR Know how to convert an angle from radians to degrees. For example,


$BR
\(1\hbox{rad} = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} \({}^\circ.\)
EOT

$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(1/$pi*180));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

(Enter your answers with at least 4 digits.)

$BR Understand the symmetry of the trigonometric functions (e.g.,
sin is odd, cos is even) and how to work with it.

$BR Given a right triangle and the lengths of its sides, know how to 
compute the trigonometric functions of its angles.  
For example, suppose you have a right triangle whose two short sides
have lengths 5 feet and 12 feet, respectively.  Then the length of the
hypotenuse is
\{ ans_rule(12) \} feet.  (Use the Pythagorean Theorem to figure this out.)
EOT


ANS(num_cmp(13));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Now let \(t\) be the angle in that triangle opposite the side of
length 5.  Then 

$BR
\(\cos t = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \}, 
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(12/13));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));


$BR
\(\sin t = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \},  and
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(5/13));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR
\(\tan t = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \}.  
EOT

ANS(num_cmp(5/12));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR Know how to use the definition of the trig functions to compute 
some missing quantities in a right triangle.  For example, given one
short side, and an angle, know how to compute the other short side or
the hypotenuse.


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
Given the value of one trigonometric function (and possibly some extra
information about the sign of another), know how to figure out the
values of the other trigonometric functions, without knowing the
angle.

For example, suppose \(t\) is an angle whose terminal side is in the
second quadrant, and \(\sin t = \frac{1}{2}.\)  Then
$BR
\(\cos t =  \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} and 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-sqrt(3)/2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\tan t =  \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-1/sqrt(3)));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR Know how to recognize the algebraic form of a modified sin or cos
function function given 
a graph.  For example, suppose that 
\{image("e1.gif", height => 400, width => 400);\} 
the graph in the nearby Figure is the graph of the function
\[f(t) = a\sin(bt-c)\]
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive integers.  You should be able to
figure out \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\).  In this case,
$BR
\(a =  \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(b =  \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(c =  \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR Given a modified sin function, sketch its graph.  Do this
reasonably accurately so I can tell from your graph amplitude, phase
shift, and period.

$BR Know how to do the same for modified graphs of the tan function.
