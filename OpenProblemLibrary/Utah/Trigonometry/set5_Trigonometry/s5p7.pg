TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));

Suppose you have an isosceles triangle, and each of the equal sides
has a length of \(1\) foot.  Suppose the angle formed by those two
sides is \(45^\circ\).  Then the area of the triangle is \{
ans_rule(21) \} square feet.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Draw the triangle.  Draw the height.  It divides
the triangle into two congruent right triangles.  Compute the missing
lengths of the sides of that triangle using the trigonometric
functions. Then compute the area of one of those two triangles, and
multiply with 2.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Drawing the picture as indicated in the hint gives a right triangle
whose hypotenuse has length 1.  The angle at the tip of the triangle
is \[\alpha=\frac{45^\circ}{2} \] degrees.  The two short sides have
lengths \(\sin \alpha\) and \(\cos \alpha\).  The area of that right
triangle equals \[\frac{(\sin \alpha)(\cos \alpha)}{2}\] Since there
are two such triangles, the area \(A\) of the original triangle is \[A
= \sin \left(\frac{45^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left(\frac{45^\circ}{2}
\right) \approx 0.353553 \hbox{square feet}.\]
