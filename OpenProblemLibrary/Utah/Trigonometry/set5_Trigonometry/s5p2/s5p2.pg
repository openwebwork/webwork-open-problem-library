TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

We use a standard notation:
\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) denote the sides of the triangles and their
lengths, and \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\)  denote the angles opposite \(a\),
\(b\), and \(c\), respectively, as indicated in the nearby figure.

$BR
\{image("fig.gif", height => 292, width => 387);\} 
$BR
Thus \(a\) and \(b\)
are the lengths of the two short sides, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.
Use the Pythagorean Theorem to compute any missing length.  Assume
also that \(A\) denotes the angle opposite \(a\), \(B\) the angle
opposite \(b\), and, of course, \(C\) the right angle.

$BR

I recommend that in this problem you enter values of the trig
functions as fractions.

$BR

Suppose \(a=5\) and \(b = 12\).

Then
$BR
\(c = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \},
EOT
$pi=2.0*acos(0.0);
ANS(num_cmp(13));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\sin(A) = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} ,
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(5/13));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\cos(A) = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \} , and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(12/13));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
\(\tan(A) = \)  \{ ans_rule(12) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(5/12));
