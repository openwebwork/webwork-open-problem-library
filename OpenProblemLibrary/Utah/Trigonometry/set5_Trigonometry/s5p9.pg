Suppose you have an isosceles triangle, and each of the equal sides
has a length of \(r\) feet.  Suppose the angle formed by those two
sides is \(t\).  Then the area of the triangle is \{
ans_rule(24) \} square feet.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Draw the triangle.  Draw the height.  It divides
the triangle into two congruent right triangles.  Compute the missing
lengths of the sides of that triangle using the trigonometric
functions. Then compute the area of one of those two triangles, and
multiply with 2.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We have a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length \(r\).  The angle
at the tip of the triangle is \[\alpha=\frac{t}{2} \] degrees.  The
two short sides have lengths \(r\sin \alpha\) and \(r\cos \alpha\).
Since there are two such triangles, the area \(A\) of the original
triangle is \[A = r^2\sin \left(\frac{t}{2} \right) \cos
\left(\frac{t}{2} \right)\]
