TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You are hiking along the edge of the Green River (which is running
straight in the area of interest).  Straight across from you on the
opposite shore there is a particularly noticeable boulder at the edge
of the river.  You walk 120 feet along the shore of the river, and now
the line from you to  the boulder makes an angle of
\(35^\circ \) with the edge of the river.  You whip out your trusty
scientific calculator and deduce that the width of the river at this
point is \{ ans_rule(21) \} feet.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Draw a picture.  "Straight across" means that
the line from you to the boulder forms a right angle with the shore of
the river.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Consider the right triangle formed by your initial position, your
position after your 120 feet walk, and the boulder.
Let \(w\) denote the unknown width of the river.  Then 
\[\tan(35^\circ) = \frac{w}{120},\]
i.e.,
\[w = 120 \times \tan(35^\circ) \approx 84.024 \hbox{~feet}.\]
