The next three problems explore some techniques of data analysis.

$BR

According to the \{htmlLink("http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/", "US
Bureau of the Census")\}, the world population in the year 1950 was
\(A=$A\), and in 2000 it was \(B=$B.\) We'll use
\(A\) and \(B\) so we don't have to keep writing those large and
idiosyncratic numbers.  We usually use \(y\) and \(x\) in the equation
of a line, but in this and the following problem let's use \(N\) and
\(t\) instead.  \(t\) stands for time and \(N\) for the size of the
population. 

$BR
If
\[N(t) = mt + b\]
such that \(N(1950) = A \) and \(N(2000) = B\), then

\(m=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}  and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($m));

and 
\(b= \)\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($b));

$BR
Suppose you want to estimate the population in 1975.  To that end you
compute
\(N(1975) \) = \{ ans_rule(10) \}.   
(Round your answers to the nearest integer. The process illustrated in
this problem is called $BITALIC linear interpolation$EITALIC.)
