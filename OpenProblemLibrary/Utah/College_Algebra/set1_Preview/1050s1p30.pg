TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

One pipe can fill a tank three times as fast as another pipe.
If together the two pipes can fill the tank in 36 minutes, how many
minutes would it take the slower pipe to fill the tank by itself?


$BR
Your answer:  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.



EOT

$answer = 144;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Introduce a variable. Then set up an equation by
asking how much those pipes can do in a minute.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Let's suppose it takes the slower pipe \(x\) minutes to fill the tank.
Then the slow pipe can fill \(\frac{1}{x}\) of the tank in one minute,
the fast pipe can fill \(\frac{3}{x}\) of the tank in one minute, and
the two pipes together can fill \(\frac{1}{36}\) of the tank in one
minute.  

$BR
Thus

\[\frac{1}{x}+ \frac{3}{x} = \frac{1}{36}.\]
Multiplying with \(36x\) on both sides gives
\[36 + 108 = 144 = x.\]
The slow pipe will take 144 minutes to fill the tank.
