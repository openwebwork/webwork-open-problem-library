$n = random(601,1000,2);

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The following problem foreshadows (but of course does not require)
another one of our topics, $BBOLD logarithms$EBOLD:


$BR
Supposing the same situation as before, how many rounds need to be
played?
$BR
Your answer:  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.



EOT

$answer = 10;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD This is not as simple as the preceding question.
Unless you see it without it, your best bet is actually to go through
the rounds and
count them.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Each round eliminates about half the remaining players.
Since $n is between \(2^9 = 512\) and \(2^{10 } = 1024\) the
tournament takes 10 rounds.
