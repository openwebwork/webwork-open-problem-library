At the end of December, 2005, about 6,000 pilots of financially
troubled Delta Airlines accepted a 14 $PERCENT pay cut.  Delta
announced that this would save them approximately $DOLLAR 143 million
annually.  Based on this information, the average annual pay of a Delta pilot
before the cut is $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  After the cut it is 
$DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20) \}.

salary is before the cut.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
The average cut for each pilot is $DOLLAR \( \frac{143,000,000}  {6,000} 
\approx 23,833.\) Dividing this number by 0.14 gives a pre-cut salary of 
$DOLLAR 170,238.  Subtracting the cut gives a post-cut salary of
$DOLLAR 146,405.
