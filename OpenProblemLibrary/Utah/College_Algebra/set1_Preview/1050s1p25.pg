TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose you obtain 100 percent credit on all WeBWorK work assignments in
this class.   Then the minimum average percentage on the exams that will
still get you an A in this class is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.  Your answer
should be a number between 0 and 100.  However, the answer is not a
natural number.  You may enter a fraction.  Remember that WeBWorK
expects your answer to be within one tenth of one percent of its
answer.  The information you need to answer this question is given in
your syllabus.

$w=39;
$a=90;

$answer = ($a-$w)*100/(100-$w);




ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

$p = int(100*$answer);
$p = $p/100;
$rem = $a-$w;
$m =100-$w;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The main source of confusion in this problem
is the fact that the word $BITALIC percent$EITALIC means three different things:
the percent you get over all in the class, the percent that the home
works count towards your grade, and the percent you obtain on your
exams.  Let's call the overall percent $BITALIC points$EITALIC.  According to the
syllabus you need $a points to get an A.  The WeBWorK account for $w
points, and since you get all of those (100 percent) you get $w points
from the home works.  So you need $rem more points from the exams.
The maximum number of points from the exams is $m , and $rem is
\[p=\frac{100\times $rem}{$m}\approx $p\] percent of $m points.  So
you need to get at least $p percent on the exams, on average.
