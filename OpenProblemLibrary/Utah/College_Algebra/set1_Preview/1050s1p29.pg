Suppose in a certain season the Jazz average 98 points in their first
three games.
How many points do they have to score in their fourth game to
average 100 points in their first four games?



$BR
Your answer:  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.



EOT

$answer = 106;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD The average number of points is the total number
divided by the number of games.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
To have an average of 100 in four games the Jazz need to score 400
points total.  In the first three games they scored \(3\times 98 =
294\) points, so to reach 400 in the fourth game they to score 106
points.
Another way to look at this is to think of them as aiming to score 100
points in each game.  They miss 6 points in the first three games, so
to make up for the loss they have to score 106 points in the fourth game.
