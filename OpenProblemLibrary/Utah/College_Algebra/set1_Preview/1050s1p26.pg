TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Light travels through vacuum at a speed of approximately 186,000
miles per second.  The distance of the sun from earth is approximately 
93,000,000 miles.  Thus it takes  \{ ans_rule(20) \} minutes for light
to travel from the sun to earth.
EOT

$answer = 93000000/186000/60;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Proxima Centauri, the closest known star other than the Sun, has a distance of 
approximately \(2.5 \times 10^{13}\) miles.  It takes sun light 
 \{ ans_rule(20) \} years to reach Proxima Centauri.
(Assume that a year has 365.25 days.)
EOT

$answer = 2.5E13/365.25/24/3600/186000;
ANS(num_cmp($answer, mode=>"arith"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Distance = speed times time.  There are 
60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 
365.25 days in a year.  Use scientific notation, e.g., 
\[2.5\times10^{13} = 2.5E13.\]
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Basically we have to convert units and keep track of large numbers.
The time \(t\) to travel at the speed of light from here to the sun is
\[t = \frac{93,000,000}{186,000} \hbox{~seconds} = 8.333 \hbox{~minutes}.\]
The time \(T\) for light to travel from here to Proxima Centauri is
\[T = \frac{2.5 \times 10^{13}}{186,000,000\times 365.25 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60} = 4.259 \hbox{~years}.\]
