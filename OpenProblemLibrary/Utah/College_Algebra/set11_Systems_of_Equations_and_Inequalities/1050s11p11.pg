TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

You have boxes of five types.  They are characterized by their length
\(L\), their width \(W\), their height \(H\), their age \(A\), and
their price \(P\), as given in the following table:

\[\begin{array}{cccccc}
\hbox{type} & L & W & H & A & P \\
I & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
II & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 \\
III & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
IV & 1 & 2 & 4 & 1 & 2 \\
V & 1 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 3 \\
\end{array}
\]

$BR So for example, boxes of type IV measure 1 by 2 by 4 feet, are a
year old, and cost\char 36 2.- each.

Suppose the sum of the lengths of your boxes is $L, the sum of their
widths $W, the sum of their heights $H, the sum of their ages $A, and the
total price of those boxes $P.
