Let \(p\) be the quartic (degree 4) polynomial that satisfies
\[p(i) = 2^i,\quad i = 0,1,2,3,4.\]
Then 
$BR
\(p(x) = \)  \{ ans_rule(40) \}.

$BR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD 
You may have a better idea, but a brute force
approach is to write 
\[p(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e\] 
where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), and \(e\), are the unknown coefficients,
and then solve the linear system \(p(0) = 1\), \(p(1) = 2\), \(p(2) =
4\), \(p(3) = 8\), and \(p(4) = 16\) for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\),
and \(e\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
Proceeding as suggested in the hint gives the linear system

\[
\begin{array}{llllllllllllll}
  &  &  &  & e &= 1 \\
a &+ b &+ c &+ d &+ e &= 2 \\
16a &+ 8b &+ 4c &+ 2d &+ e &= 4 \\
81a &+ 27b &+ 9c &+ 3d &+ e &= 8 \\
256a &+ 64b &+ 16c &+ 4d &+ e &= 16 \\
\end{array}
\]

This is a system of five equations in five unknowns, but of course
\(e\) is given explicitly in the first equations, and so we really only
have to solve four equations in four unknowns.  The solution of this
problem is
\[a=\frac{1}{24}, b = -\frac{1}{12}, c = 
\frac{11}{24}, d=\frac{7}{12}, e=1.\]

$BR

  Here is another, more complicated looking, but actually much 
simpler, approach:

Write 
\( p(x) = A + Bx + Cx(x-1) + Dx(x-1)(x-2) + Ex(x-1)(x-2)(x-3).\)
Then we get the $BBOLD triangular$EBOLD linear system
\[
\begin{array}{llllllll}
p(0) &= A &  &  &  &    &= 1 \\
p(1) &= A &+ B &  &  &    &= 2 \\
p(2) &= A &+ 2B &+ 2C &  &    &= 4 \\
p(3) &= A &+ 3B &+ 6C &+ 6D   &  &= 8 \\
p(4) &= A &+ 4B &+ 12C &+ 24D &  + 24E &=16 \\
\end{array}
\]

This system requires no elimination at all, just 
(in this case $BBOLD forward $EBOLD) substitution.

The first equations tells us that \(A=1\).  
Substituting in the second equation and solving for \(B\) gives 
\(B=1\), the third equation gives \(C=1/2\), the fourth \(D=1/6\), 
and the last \(E=1/24\).
Thus 
\( p(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x(x-1) + \frac{1}{6}x(x-1)(x-2) + 
\frac{1}{24}x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3).\)
You can of course convert this polynomial to standard form 
but you can also just enter it as
\( 1+x+1/2x(x-1)+1/6x(x-1)(x-2)+1/24x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\)
