TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You and your friend part at an intersection.  You drive off north at
50 mph, and your friend drives east at 50mph.  After three hours the
distance between you and your friend is
 \{ ans_rule(18) \} miles.
EOT
$ans=sqrt(2*150*150);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Use the Pythagorean Theorem.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD You and your friend each travel 150 miles in the
three hours.  By the Pythagorean Theorem the distance \(d\) between
you and your friend is \[d = \sqrt{150^2+150^2} = \sqrt{45,000}
\approx 212.1 \hbox{~miles}.\]
