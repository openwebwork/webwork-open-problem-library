The next few questions ask about the symmetry properties of
combinations of symmetric functions.  For example, if \(f\) and
\(g\) are both odd, then \(f+g\) is also odd. You can see this as
follows.  We know that \(f(x) = -f(-x)\) and \(g(x)= - g(-x)\), 
since
\(f\) and \(g\) are both odd.  For the sum \(h=f+g\) we get: \[
\begin{array}{rcl}
h(x) &=& (f+g)(x) \\
&=&
f(x)+g(x) \\ &=& -f(-x)-g(-x) \\ &=& -(f+g)(-x) \\ &=&-h(-x),\\
\end{array}\] and hence the sum is odd as well.

$PAR You can see similarly that if \(f\) and \(g\) are both even, then
so is \(f+g\).

$PAR On the other hand, if \(f\) is even and \(g\) is odd then usually
(i.e., always, unless \(f\) or \(g\) is zero) \(f+g\) will be neither
even nor odd, as illustrated, for example by \(f(x) =1\) and \(g(x) =
x\).

$PAR Note that this is counterintuitive: The sum of two odd integers
is even, and the sum of and even and an odd integer is odd.  In those
two cases functions are unlike integers. On the other hand, the sum of
two even integers is even, as is the sum of two even functions.

$PAR
As always, you don't want to memorize rules like that.  You don't even
need to go through the above general argument each time you need a
rule.  Instead, just consider an example.  For example, clearly
\(x+x^3\) is odd, \(x^2+x^4\) is even, and \(x+1\) is neither even nor
odd.  Those examples generalize, but if you are ever in doubt you can
always revert to checking the actual definition, as above.

$PAR
What happens when we subtract instead of add \(f\) and \(g\)?  Let
\[h=f-g.\] Then

$PAR 
\(h\) is \{ ans_rule(2) \} if \(f\) and \(g\) are both even,

$PAR 
\(h\) is \{ ans_rule(2) \} if \(f\) is even and \(g\) is odd, and

$PAR 
\(h\) is \{ ans_rule(2) \} if \(f\) and \(g\) are both odd.


$PAR (As before, and in the following problems, enter $BBOLD E$EBOLD if the
function is even, $BBOLD O$EBOLD if it is odd, and $BBOLD N$EBOLD if it is neither
even nor odd.)
