$BR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD
Observe that we can't divide by zero, and we can't take the square
root of a negative number. To find the interval that's not in the range 
look for critical numbers.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Since the denominator is zero when \(x=\pm2\)
the domain is the set of all real numbers other than \(\pm2\).  As
discussed in class, to find the range we solve the equation
\[\frac{x^2}{4-x^2} = y \] for \(x\).
Multiplying with \((4-x^2)\) gives
\[x^2 = 4y - x^2y\]
This can be rewritten as
\[x^2+x^2y = x^2(1+y) = 4y\]
or \[x^2 = \frac{4y}{1+y}.\]
This equation will have two solutions provided the right hand side is
defined (i.e., \(y\neq -1\)) and nonnegative.  So we need to find the
values of \(y\) for which
\[\frac{4y}{1+y} \geq 0.\]
There are two critical numbers for this inequality: \(y=0\) where we
have equality, and \(y=-1\) where we divide by zero.
So we consider three cases:
$BR 

$BR \(-\infty < y < -1\).  Both the numerator and denominator are
negative, so the ratio is positive, \(y\) does lie in the range.

$BR \( -1 < y < 0 \). The numerator is negative , the denominator
positive, \(y\) does not lie in the range.

$BR \( 0 \leq y < \infty\).  The numerator is nonnegative, the
denominator positive, \(y\) does lie in the range.

$BR

Thus the interval \([-1,0)\) is $BBOLD excluded$EBOLD from the range.
