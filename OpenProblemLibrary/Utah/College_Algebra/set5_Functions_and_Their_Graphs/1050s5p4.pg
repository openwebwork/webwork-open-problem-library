TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You and your friend part at an intersection.  Your friend drives away
north at a constant speed. You linger at the intersection for an hour,
and then drive off due east at a speed that is $d miles per hour
faster than your friend's speed. 2 hours after your friend's departure
the distance between the two of you is $D miles.  Your friend is traveling
at a speed of \{ ans_rule(8) \} miles per hours.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(v\) be your friend's speed.  After 2
hours your friend has traveled \(2 v\) miles.  You start an hour
later and travel faster, so 1 hour after your friend's departure you
have traveled \((v+$d)\) miles.  By the Pythagorean
Theorem the distance between you and your friend $t hours after your
friend's departure equals \[\sqrt{(2 v)^2 + (v+$d)^2} =
$D\hbox{~miles}.\] As before, this quadratic equation can be solved by
squaring on both sides, to get rid of the square root, and then
simplifying and completing the square.  The solution is \[v = $v
\hbox{~miles}.\]
