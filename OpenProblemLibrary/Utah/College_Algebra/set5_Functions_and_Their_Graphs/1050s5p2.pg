TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You and your friend part at an intersection.  You drive off north at
50 mph, and your friend drives east at 60mph.  After three hours the
distance between you and your friend is
 \{ ans_rule(18) \} miles.
EOT
$ans=sqrt(150*150 + 180*180);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD You travel 150 miles in the three hours, and
during the same time your friend travels 180 miles.  By the
Pythagorean Theorem the distance \(d\) between you and your friend is
\[d = \sqrt{150^2+180^2} = \sqrt{54,900} \approx 234.3
\hbox{~miles}.\]
