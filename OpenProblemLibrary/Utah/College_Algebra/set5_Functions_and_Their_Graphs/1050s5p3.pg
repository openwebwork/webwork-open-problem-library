TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You and your friend part at an intersection.  You drive off north at a
constant speed, and your friend drives east at a speed that is $d mph
higher.  After $t hours the distance between you and your friend is
$Dr miles.  You have been driving at \{ ans_rule(18) \} mph.
(Round to the nearest mile).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(v\) be your speed.
In $t hours you travel a distance of \($t v\) miles.  During the same
time, your friend travels a distance of \($t(v+$d)\) miles.  By
the Pythagorean Theorem the distance between you and your friend after $t
hours equals \[\sqrt{($t v)^2 + ($t(v+$d))^2} = $Dr\hbox{~miles}.\] This
quadratic equation can be solved by squaring on both sides, to get
rid of the square root, and then simplifying and completing the
square.  The answer is \[v = $v \hbox{~miles}.\]
That's your speed.
