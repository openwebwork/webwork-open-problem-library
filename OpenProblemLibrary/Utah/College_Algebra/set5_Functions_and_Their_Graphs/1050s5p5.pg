TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You and your friend part at an intersection.  Your friend drives away
north at a constant speed. You linger at the intersection for an hour,
and then drive off due east at a speed that is $d miles per hour
faster than your friend's speed. Two hours after your friend's
departure the distance between the two of you is $D miles.  $t hours
after your friend's departure your distance from your friend is \{
ans_rule(15) \} miles.  (Remember that ww expects your answer to be
within one tenth of one percent of the true answer.)
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($ans));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We can work out your friend's speed as in the
preceding problem.  It is $v mph.  Hence you are traveling at $V mph.
In those $t hours, your friend travels \($t\times $v = $tv\) miles,
and you travel \(($t-1)\times$V = $TV\) miles.  By the Pythagorean
Theorem, the distance \(d\) between you and your friend is \[d =
\sqrt{$tv^2 + $TV^2} \approx $m \hbox{~miles}.\]
