Consider the question of whether an equation
defines one of the variables as a function of the other.  You can
answer all of these questions by seeing if the equation can be solved
for one variable in terms of the other.

$BR 
For example, the equation \[y-x^2=0\] can be rewritten as \[ y = x^2\]
and so any choice of \(x\) uniquely determines \(y\).  We can think of
\(y\) as being given by the function \[y = f(x) = x^2.\] On the other
hand, for a particular value of \(y\), e.g., \(y=1\), there are two
values of \(x\), i.e., \(x=\pm 1\), and so the equation \(y-x^2=0\)
does not define \(x\) as a function of \(y\).  Similarly, by switching
the roles of \(x\) and \(y\) we see that the equation \[y^2-x=0\]
defines \(x\) as a function of \(y\), but not \(y\) as a function of
\(x\).

$BR By contrast, the equation \[3x+4y=5\] determines \(x\) as a
function of \(y\) and also determines \(y\) as a function of \(x\),
while the equation \[x^2+y^2 = 1\] defines neither variable as a
function of the other.

$BR You can verify all of the above statements by applying the
vertical and horizontal line tests.

$BR

For the following equations, enter

$BR

$BR $BBOLD y$EBOLD if the equation defines \(y\) as a function of \(x\) but
not vice versa,

$BR $BBOLD x$EBOLD if the equation defines \(x\) as a function of \(y\) but
not vice versa,

$BR $BBOLD b$EBOLD (for "both") if the equation defines \(x\) as a function
of \(y\) and also \(y\) as a function of \(x\), and

$BR $BBOLD n$EBOLD (for "neither") if the equation defines neither variable
as a function of the other.

$BR

$BR These equations are the same as discussed above, so you can check
that you understand how to answer this and the following questions:

$BR

$BR \(y-x^2 = 0 \) \{ ans_rule(8) \}.

EOT
ANS(str_cmp("y"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \(y^2-x = 0 \) \{ ans_rule(8) \}.

EOT
ANS(str_cmp("x"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \(3x+4y+5=0\)  \{ ans_rule(8) \}.

EOT
ANS(str_cmp("b"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR \(x^2+y^2=1\)  \{ ans_rule(8) \}.

$BR

EOT
ANS(str_cmp("n"));
