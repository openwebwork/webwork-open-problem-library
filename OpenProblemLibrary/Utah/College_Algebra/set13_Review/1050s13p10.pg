TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BBOLD Logarithm Rules. $EBOLD Understand the rules for logarithms.  You 
should be
able to write logarithms as sums, differences or multiples of
logarithms when appropriate.  Or, rewrite expressions in terms of several
logarithms to be in terms of single logarithms.
For example, 

$BR
\(\log_2 32 (a+1)^{-4} = A + B \log_2 (C) \)
where 
\(A = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}  and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(5));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\(B = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} are numbers and
$BR
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-4));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(C=\)  \{ ans_rule(10) \} is an expression in terms of \(a\).
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("a+1", limits=>[[0,5]], vars=>["a"]));
