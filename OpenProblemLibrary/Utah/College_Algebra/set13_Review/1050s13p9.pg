$BBOLD More Graphing. $EBOLD
Know how to graph rational functions and to compute asymptotes and intercepts.
For example the graph of 
\[f(x) = \frac{2x-1}{x-1}\]
has a horizontal asymptote
\(y=\)
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} and a vertical asymptote
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(x=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}.  
$BR Its \(y\) intercept is 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(y=\)
\{ ans_rule(10) \} and its \(x\) intercept is
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(x=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}.  You should also draw the graph.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/2));
