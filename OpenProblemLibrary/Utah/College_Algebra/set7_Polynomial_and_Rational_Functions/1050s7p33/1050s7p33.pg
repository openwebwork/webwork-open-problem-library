TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

A rectangular page is designed to contain 72 square inches of print.
The margins at the top and bottom of the page are each 4 inches deep.
The margins on each side are 2 inches wide.  The dimensions of page
are such that the least possible amount of paper is used.

$BR

Thus the width of the page is \{ ans_rule(3) \} inches,
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(10));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
its height is  \{ ans_rule(3) \} inches, 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(20));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
its total area is  \{ ans_rule(3) \} square inches.  There's a whole lot
of white space on that page, its minimum area not withstanding!
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(200));



TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Let \(x\) be the width of the printed part of
the page, and \(72/x\) its height. Plot the area as a function of \(x\). Also
think about your expectations.  Do you expect the page to be taller
than it's wide, or vice versa?  Why?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Proceeding as suggested in the hint, let \(x\) be the width of the
printed part of the
page.  Since the area of the printed part is 72 square inches, its
height is 72/x inches.  The total area of the page is
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
A(x) &=& (x+2\times 2)(\frac{72}{x} + 2\times 4) \\
&=& 72 +8x + \frac{288}{x} +32 \\
&=& 104 + 8x + \frac{288}{x} \\
\end{array}
\]

That's the function we want to minimize.

$BR

The following three pictures show increasingly smaller portions of the
graph.

$BR The first graphs shows \(A(x)\) where x is in the interval
\([1..10]\)
which seems a reasonable range of possible values for \(x\).  

\{image("1050s7p33-1.gif", height => 512, width => 512);\} 

$BR The graph shows that there is a minimum close to 6.  Plotting
the graph of \(A(x)\) in the interval \([5.5,6.5]\) gives:

\{image("1050s7p33-2.gif", height => 512, width => 512);\} 

$BR The minimum occurs very close to \(x=6\).  Zooming in further, to
the interval \([5.9,6.1]\) confirms our suspicion.

\{image("1050s7p33-3.gif", height => 512, width => 512);\} 

$BR It turns out that at the minimum \(x=6\) exactly, and the minimum
area \(A(6)=200.\)
