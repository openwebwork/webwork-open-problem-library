The equation
\[x^4-9x^3+31x^2-49x+30 = 0\]
has the conjugate complex pair of solutions
\(x=2\pm i\).  The equation also has two real solutions.
The smaller is  \{ ans_rule(10) \}, and the larger is

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
As seen in the previous problem, \((x^2-4x+5)\) is a factor of \(p\).  Long division shows that 
\[p(x) = (x^2-4x+5)(x^2-5x+6).\]
The first factor has the zeros stated in the problem, the second has 
the zeros \(2\) and \(3\).
