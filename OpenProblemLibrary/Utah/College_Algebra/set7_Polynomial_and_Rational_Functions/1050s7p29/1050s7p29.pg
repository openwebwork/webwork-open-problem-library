SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The purple graph has two asymptotes, the
\(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. It's the familiar graph of \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)

$BR The red graph has \(y=1\) as a horizontal asymptote, and no
vertical asymptotes.  The leading terms of numerator and denominator
must be equal, and the denominator is never zero.  So the red graph is
the graph of \(f(x)) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+1}.\)

$BR


The green and yellow graphs each have two vertical asymptotes, at
\(x=\pm 1\).  So their functions are the ones with the denominator
being \(x^2-1\).  The green graph has a slanted asymptote. The
numerator of its function is of degree one larger than the
denominator.  The green graph is the graph of \(f(x) =
\frac{x^3}{x^2-1}.\)  The yellow graph has the \(x\) axis as an
asymptote, it's the graph of \(f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2-1}.\)

$BR The blue graph has the \(x\) axis as an asymptote, and there are
no vertical asymptotes.  It's the graph of \(f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}.\)
