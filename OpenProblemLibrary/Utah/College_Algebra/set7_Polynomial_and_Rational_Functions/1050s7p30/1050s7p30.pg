For the following functions, use "x" to indicate that the \(x\)-axis
is an asymptote, "h" to indicate a horizontal asymptote other than the
\(x\) axis, "v" to indicate a vertical asymptote, "s" to indicate a
slanted asymptote, and "n" the lack of an asymptote.  If the graph of
a function has several types of asymptotes indicate them all in alphabetical order.

$BR

 For example, the function \[f(x) = \frac{x^3}{x^2-1}\] has a slanted
asymptote since the degree of the numerator is one more than the
degree of the denominator, and it also has two vertical asymptotes (at
\(x=\pm1\)).  So you would enter "sv" (without the double quotation
marks.  The graph of \[f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \] has vertical asymptote
(the \(y\)-axis) and the \(x\)-axis as an asymptote, so you would
enter "vx".  On the other hand,  the graph of \[f(x) = \frac{x^3}{x^2+1}\]
has only a slanted asymptote, so you would enter just "s".

To make this clear the following picture shows the graphs involved:

$BR
It may not be clear from the picture that the green graph (of \(f(x) =
\frac{x^3}{x^2+1}\) has a slanted asymptote, to make this clearer the
Figure also contains the (red) graph of its asymptote defined by the
equation \(y=x\).  The yellow graph is the graph of \(f(x) =
\frac{x^3}{x^2-1}\), the blue graph is the graph of \(f(x) =
\frac{1}{x}.\)
