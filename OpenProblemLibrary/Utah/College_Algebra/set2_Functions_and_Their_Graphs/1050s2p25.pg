$BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD
After one year you have your original investment, plus the interest
you earned during that year.  Every year you multiply your current
capital (the amount of money you have in the bank at the beginning of
the year) with the same factor.  Figure out that factor.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD If you invest a capital of \(C\) dollars at
an annual interest rate of \(p\) percent you multiply your capital
each year with a factor \(\left(1+ \frac{p}{100}\right)\).  After \(n\)
years you multiply with \(\left(1+ \frac{p}{100}\right)^n\).  With p
= $p $PERCENT, and investing $DOLLAR $c we obtain $DOLLAR $L1 after one
year\((n=1)\), $DOLLAR $L2 after 2 years \((n=2)\), and $DOLLAR $L10
after 10 years \((n=10)\).
