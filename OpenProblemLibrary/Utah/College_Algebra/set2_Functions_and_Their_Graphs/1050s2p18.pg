TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The next few problems present a sequence of typical equations and ask
you to solve them.  You need to understand the techniques involved and
gain facility in using them.  So you should do these problems by hand
rather than use an advanced calculator or a symbol manipulation
language like Maple.  I recommend you enter answers as exact
arithmetic expressions rather than decimal approximations.  So, for
example, type $BITALIC 3/7$EITALIC instead of 0.42857 or $BITALIC sqrt(3)/2$EITALIC instead
of 0.86602.

The solution of the equation
\[(x-1)(x-2) = (x+2)(x-3)\]
is 
\(x=\)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp("4"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Expand on both sides, collect everything on one
side, and solve the resulting linear equation.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Expanding on both sides gives: \[x^2-3x+2 =
x^2-x-6.\] Subtracting \((x^2-x-6)\) on both sides gives \[-2x+8 =
0.\] Subtracting 8 on both sides and dividing by -2 on both sides
gives the solution: \[x=4.\]
