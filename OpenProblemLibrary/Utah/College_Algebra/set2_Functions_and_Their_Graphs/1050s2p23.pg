TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Your
department sends its copying to the photocopy center of your company.
The center bills your department $DOLLAR $p per page. You have
investigated the possibility of buying a departmental copier for
$DOLLAR $C.  With your own copier, the cost per page would be $DOLLAR
$own.  The expected life of the copier is $L years. You figure that
you must make at least \{ ans_rule(10) \} copies per year to justify
buying the copier. 
$PAR
Your answer should be a natural number.  
$BR
(Of course this question totally ignores the $BITALIC convenience$EITALIC of
having your own copier.  Also, the number of copies is likely to go
up, and so may the price charged by the copy center.)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let \(n\) be the minimum number of copies per year that we need to make 
in order for the purchased copier to be cheaper than the current setup.
The cost \(c\) of using the copier for $L years is 
\[c= $C + $L\times $own \times n.\]
The cost \(C\) of using the copy center is
\[C = $L \times $p \times n.\]
We want 
\[ $L \times $p \times n > $C + $L\times $own \times n \]
Solving this inequality for \(n\) gives 
\[ n > \frac{$C}{$L($p-$own)} \]
and so \(n\) must be at least $answer.
