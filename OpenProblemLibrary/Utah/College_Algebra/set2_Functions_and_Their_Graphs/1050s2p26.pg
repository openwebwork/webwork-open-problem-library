$p = random(5,10,1);
$c = random(500,1000,100);

$L1 = int(100*$c*(1-$p/100)+0.5)/100;
$L2 = int(100*$c*(1-$p/100)**2+0.5)/100;
$L10 = int(100*$c*(1-$p/100)**10+0.5)/100;

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
You have $c micrograms of a certain radioactive material.  In the
course of each year $p percent of the material decays (and turns into
something inert and benign).
$BR
After one year you have 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} micrograms of the material left..
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($L1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
After two years you have
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} micrograms.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($L2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
After 10 years you have 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} micrograms.  
$BR
WeBWorK will accept your answer if it is within one tenth of one
percent of what it believes to be the true answer.  You are safe if
you enter the number of micrograms with 2 digits beyond the decimal
point.  You can also enter an arithmetic expression.

This is like the preceding problem.  Adding interest corresponds to
material decaying.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Each year we multiply the amount of material
with the factor \(\left(1- \frac{p}{100}\right)\).  After \(n\) years you
multiply with \(\left(1- \frac{p}{100}\right)^n\).  With p = $p $PERCENT, 
we
have $L1 micrograms after one year\((n=1)\), $L2 micrograms after 2
years \((n=2)\), and $L10 micrograms after 10 years \((n=10)\).
