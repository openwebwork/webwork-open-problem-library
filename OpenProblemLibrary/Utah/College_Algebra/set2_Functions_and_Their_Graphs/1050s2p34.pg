TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This is one of the more challenging problems promised in your
syllabus.  It looks pretty bewildering but it can be solved by a
straightforward application of one of the main principles we discuss
in this class every day.  Suppose \[x = \sqrt{1+ \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 +
\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{ 1 + \ldots}}}}}\] where $BBOLD the square roots go on
forever. $EBOLD  You may assume (and it is true) that this expression
actually defines a positive number \(x\).  What is it?  Enter it as a
decimal or radical expression: \{ans_rule(15) \}


EOT
ANS(num_cmp((1+sqrt(5))/2));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
We solve equations by applying the same operation on both sides to get
rid of what bothers us.  In this equation, surely what bothers us are
the square roots.  We can get rid of one of them by squaring on both
sides: 

$BR
\[x^2 = 1+ \sqrt{1+ \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{ 1 +
\ldots}}}}}\]
$BR

There are still infinitely many square roots left. But hey, that bunch
of square roots on the right just defines \(x\).  So we have the
equation

\[x^2 = 1 + x.\]

This is just a quadratic equation whose positive solution is \[x =
\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2} \approx 1.618\] which is our desired answer.
[This particular number is sometimes called the $BITALIC golden ratio.$EITALIC
Its reciprocal is variously called the $BITALIC golden section$EITALIC, 
$BITALIC
golden mean, $EITALIC or $BITALIC mean and extreme ratio$EITALIC.]
