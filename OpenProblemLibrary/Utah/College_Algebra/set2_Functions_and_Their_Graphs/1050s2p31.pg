TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In a promotional sale, Roxanne bought one item for its regular price
and a second item for $DOLLAR 1. She paid $DOLLAR 20 for both
items.  What fraction of the price of the first item is the price of
the second item?  \{ans_rule(10) \}
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1/19));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Roxanne paid $DOLLAR 1 for the second item and $DOLLAR 19 for the
first.  (Technically, one can say that \(x\) is the price of the
second item, and the problem tells us that \(x+1=20\), but, surely,
it's obvious that the second item costs $DOLLAR 19.)  The ratio of
these two prices is \(\frac{1}{19}\).  That's what the question means
by 1 being a fraction of 19.
