According to the
\{htmlLink("http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/", "US Bureau of the
Census")\}, the world population in 1950 was 2,555,360,972.  In 2003
it was 6,302,486,693.  (These are 
\{htmlLink("http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popwnote.html",
"estimated midyear figures")\}.  The
\{htmlLink("http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html","table given
by the Bureau")\} also lists projected population figures for
2004-2050.)  Based on these figures, assuming that the population
increased by the same percentage each year from 1950 to 2003, that
yearly increase was
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} percent.

The

figures")\} for the US are populations of 152,271,000 in 1950 and
290,343,000 in 2003.  This corresponds to an annual growth rate of
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} percent.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD
Enter a radical expression, or a decimal approximation with least two
correctly rounded digits beyond the decimal point.  If you believe
that this problem requires logarithms for its solution you are on the
wrong track.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(p\) be the unknown percentage.
Then each year the population is multiplied by the factor
\(\left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)\).  Since the indicated time period is 53 years long we need to solve the equation
\[6,302,486,693 = \left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)^{53} \times 2,555,360,972.\]
Dividing by 2,555,360,972 and taking both sides to the power \(\frac{1}{53}\)
gives
\[\left(\frac{6,302,486,693}{ 2,555,360,972}\right)^{\frac{1}{53}} = 1 + \frac{p}{100}.\]
Subtracting 1 and multiplying with 100 gives the answer:
\[p = 100\times \left(1- \left(\frac{6,302,486,693}{
2,555,360,972}\right)^{\frac{1}{53}}\right) \approx 1.72 \char37.\]


$BR
The corresponding figure for the US is 1.23 $PERCENT.
