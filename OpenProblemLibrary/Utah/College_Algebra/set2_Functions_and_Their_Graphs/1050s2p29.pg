TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Tony is now three years older than Howard.  Five years ago the sum of their ages was 59.  Now, Tony is 
\{ans_rule(10) \} years old.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(36));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Let Tony's current age be \(x\) years.  Then Howard's current age is
\(x-3\) Five years ago they were five years younger, and so their
respective ages were \(x-5\) and \(x-8\). We are told that
\[x-5 + x-8 = 59.\]
This simplifies to 
\[2x-13 = 59.\] Hence \(2x=72\) and 
\[x=36.\]
