TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The fraction \[z=\frac{41}{333} \]
can be written as a repeating decimal
\(z=0.abcabcabc\ldots\)
where

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Of course you can
answer this question by keying \(41 \div 333\) into your calculator.
However, the general result, that every rational number can be written
as a repeating decimal, follows from the fact that when you apply long
division there are only finitely many possibilities for the remainder,
and eventually they must repeat.
