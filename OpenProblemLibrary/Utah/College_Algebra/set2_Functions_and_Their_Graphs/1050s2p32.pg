TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The fraction \[z=\frac{41}{333} \]
can be written as a repeating decimal
\(z=0.abcabcabc\ldots\)
where
$BR
\(a=\)  \{ans_rule(5) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\(b=\)  \{ans_rule(5) \}, and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\(c=\)  \{ans_rule(5) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Of course you can
answer this question by keying \(41 \div 333\) into your calculator.
However, the general result, that every rational number can be written
as a repeating decimal, follows from the fact that when you apply long
division there are only finitely many possibilities for the remainder,
and eventually they must repeat.
