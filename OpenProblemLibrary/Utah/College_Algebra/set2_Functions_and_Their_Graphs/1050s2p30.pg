TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
One can fit \{ans_rule(10) \} cubes, each having a surface area of 54
square inches, exactly inside a larger cube having a surface area of
216 square inches.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(8));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
A cube has six square faces. Therefore the surface area of a cube of
length \(x\) is \(6x^2\).  Let \(L\) be the length of the larger cube,
and \(S\) the length of the smaller cube.  Since \[6L^2 = 216
\quad\hbox{and}\quad 6S^2 = 54\] we have that \[L=6\quad\hbox{and}\quad S=3.\]
Hence we can fit 8 of the small cubes into the large one.

Another approach to this problem consists of using
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/scale/", "the laws of
scaling,")\} but you may not be familiar with them.  The ratio of the
surface areas of the large and small cubes is 4.  The ratio of their
lengths, therefore, is \(\sqrt{4}=2\).  The ratio of their volumes is
\(2^3=8\), and that's the desired answer.
