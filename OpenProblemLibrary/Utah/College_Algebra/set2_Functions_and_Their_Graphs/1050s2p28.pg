TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This problem is adapted from the 2000 edition of the
ARCO GRE GMAT Math Review.  It can be answered by setting up and
solving single equations in one unknown, or you may find an easier way.
$PAR Eddie earns $DOLLAR 12 per hour for a
normal 8-hour workday and \(\frac{3}{2}\) times this rate for hours
worked overtime. On a certain day, Eddie earned $DOLLAR 141 and worked
\{ ans_rule(10) \} hours and
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(10));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} minutes.

EOT
ANS(num_cmp(30));




SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
During the first 8 hours Eddie earns $DOLLAR 96.  During the remaining
\(x\) hours Eddie earns another $DOLLAR 45 at a pay of $DOLLAR 18 an
hour.  Thus \[18x = 45\] or \[x=2.5.\]  Thus Eddie works a total of 10
hours and 30 minutes.
