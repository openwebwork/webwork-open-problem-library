TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Two
planes leave simultaneously from Salt Lake City International, one flying
due north and one due east.  The northbound plane is flying $d miles
per hour faster than the east bound plane. After $t hours the planes
are $D miles apart.  The speed of the slower plane is
\{ ans_rule(10) \} miles per hour.  Round your answer to the nearest
mile per hour.  Assume the earth is flat---this is wildly inaccurate
over a distance of $D miles!

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR
$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let \(v\) be the speed of the slower plane.  In
$t hours it travels a distance of \($t v\) miles.  during the same
time, the faster plane travels a distance of \($t(v+$d)\) miles.  By
the Pythagorean Theorem the distance between the two planes after $t
hours equals \[\sqrt{($t v)^2 + ($t(v+$d))^2} = $D\hbox{~miles}.\] This
quadratic equation can be solved by squaring on both sides, to get
rid of the square root, and then simplifying and completing the
square.  The answer is \[v = $v \hbox{~miles}.\]
