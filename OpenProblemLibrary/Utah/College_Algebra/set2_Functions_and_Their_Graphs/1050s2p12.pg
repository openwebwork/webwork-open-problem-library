$BITALIC Solving an equation$EITALIC means figuring out which values of the
variable make the equation true.  The basic approach to equation
solving consists of applying the same operation on both sides of the equation
until we come up with another equation that has the variable by itself
on one side and an expression not containing that variable on the other.

$BR$BR 
For example, in the (very simple) equation \[x+3 = 5\] we subtract
\(3\) on both sides and obtain the equation \[x=2.\]
$BR$BR 
The latter equation tells us the solution, and we verify that \(x=2\)
does indeed solve the original equation by substituting \(2\) for
\(x\) in \(x+3 = 5\).  Since \(2+3\) does equal 5  we have indeed found the
solution.
$BR$BR 
The preceding two paragraphs are deceptively simple, but they describe
one of the key ideas of algebra.
$BR$BR 
The following problems explore a subtlety of the concept of ''applying
the same operation on both sides of the equation''.  In the above
example, the two equations involved are equivalent, i.e., one implies
the other.  If \(x=2\) then \(x+3 = 5\).  Conversely, if \(x+3=5\)
then \(x\) must be \(2\), there is no other solution.  Sometimes,
however, doing the same thing on both sides of an equation creates a
new equation that is not equivalent to the old one.
$BR$BR
For example, if \(x=3\), then squaring on both sides gives \(x^2=9\).
It is true that \(x=3\) implies that \(x^2=9\).  But the other
direction does not hold, if \(x^2=9\) then \(x\) may be \(-3\) since
the square of \(-3\) also equals 9.  The process of squaring
introduces a $BITALIC extraneous$EITALIC (or sometimes called $BITALIC spurious$EITALIC)
solution.  The existence of such solutions is a major reason why $BBOLD
you always check your answer. $EBOLD
$BR$BR
In this and the next few problems you are asked to decide whether two
equations are equivalent, one implies the other, or neither implies
the other.  Enter (without the quotation marks) "\(==>\)" if the left
equation implies the right, "\(<==\)" if the right equation implies
the left, "\(<==>\)" if either equation implies the other, and
"\(><\)" if neither equation implies the other.  An equation
equation A implies an equation B if B is true for all variables for
which A is true.
$BR$BR
For example,
\[x+3 = 5 \quad <==>\quad x = 2 \]
\[x=2 \quad==>\quad x^2 = 4\]
\[x^2+6=10 \quad<==\quad x = 2\]
\[x+3 = 5 \quad><\quad x^2 = 9\]
Use these statements in the following items:

\(x+3=5\) \{ ans_rule(5) \} \(x=2\).
