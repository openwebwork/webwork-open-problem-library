Many times in this class we will use $BITALIC identities$EITALIC, i.e.,
statements of equality that are true for all values of the variables
involved.
$BR
For example, \[x+y = y + x \] for all real (or complex) numbers \(x\)
and \(y\).  (This particular identity is called the $BITALIC commutative
law of addition $EITALIC . It does not matter in what sequence we add two
numbers.)  In the next few problems, enter the string "=" if the
identity holds and the string "N" (or "n") if it does not.  In all
cases, omit the quotation marks.
$BR
To get the hang of this we start with the above identity:
$BR$BR
\(x+y\) \{ ans_rule(3) \} \(y+x\).
$BR$BR (Enter an equality sign.)
EOT
ANS(str_cmp("="));

$BR$BR
Here is an example of a non-identity (enter an upper case N):
$BR$BR
\(x+y\) \{ ans_rule(3) \} \(x-y\).
$BR$BR
Many algebraic mistakes are caused by equating algebraic expressions
that are not identical.  
$BR
The next few problems illustrate widely used identities and frequently
believed
non-identities.  You could conceivably get credit for these problems
by rushing through the various possibilities, but you should pause
each time that the answer is not what you expect and figure out why
you were wrong and what is really going on.  The benefits from those 
moments of thoughtfulness will be significant and long lasting!
$BR$BR
Unless stated otherwise, identities need to hold for $BBOLD all real
numbers. $EBOLD  This includes positive and negative real numbers.  We 
don't
consider complex numbers.
