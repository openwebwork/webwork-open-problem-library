TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


The relationship between a number of decibels \(\beta\) and the
 intensity of a sound \(I\) (in watts per square meter) is
\[\beta = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\right).\]


$BR The number of decibels for a sound with an intensity of 
\(10^{-6}\) watts per square meter is
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(60));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

$BR A sound with ten times that intensity has
\{ ans_rule(10) \} decibels.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(70));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
In general, a sound with ten times the intensity of a sound with \(n\) decibels has \{ ans_rule(10) \} decibels.

to rewrite the equation given in this problem.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Our equation can be rewritten as \[\beta = 10 \left(\log_{10} I
+12\right).\] Thus if \(I= 10^{-12}\) then \(\beta = 60.\) If \(I\) is
ten times larger, then \(I = 10^{-11}\) and \(\beta =70\). In general,
multiplying the intensity with \(10\) adds \(10\) to the number of
decibels.
