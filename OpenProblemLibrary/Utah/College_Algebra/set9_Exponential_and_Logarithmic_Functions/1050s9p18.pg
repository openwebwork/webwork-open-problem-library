TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

The equation 
\[\ln(x+1) -\ln(x-2)  = \ln x\]
has the solution \(x=\)
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(3/2+sqrt(13)/2, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:  First use the properties of logarithms, then apply the exponential on both sides.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Since the logarithm of the quotient equals
the difference of the logarithms we have 
\[\ln\frac{x+1}{x-2} = \ln x.\]
Applying the natural exponential on both sides gives \[\frac{x+1}{x-2} =
e^x.\] Multiplying with \(x-2\) on both sides gives the quadratic
equation \[x+1 = x(x-2).\] 
This equation has the solutions
\[x= \frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{13}}{2}.\]
However, only the solution with the plus sign can be substituted in
the original equation, the other leads to the logarithm of a negative
number.

$BR  
Thus the solution of our equation is 
\[x = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{13}}{2}\approx 3.303\]
