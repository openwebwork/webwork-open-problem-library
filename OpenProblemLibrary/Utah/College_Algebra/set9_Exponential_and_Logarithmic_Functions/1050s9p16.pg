The equation 
\[2^{2x} -5\times 2^x + 6 = 0\]
has two solutions.  The smaller is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} and the larger is
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\{ ans_rule(10) \}.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(log(3)/log(2), mode=>"strict"));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD The substitution
\[z= 2^x\]
changes our equation
\[z^2-5z+6 = 0.\]
We have seen this quadratic equation before, and in any case we can solve it.
Its solutions are \(z=2\) and \(z=3\).  In the first case, \(x=1\), in the second,
\[x= \log_2 3 = \frac{\ln 3}{\ln 2} \approx 1.585.\]
