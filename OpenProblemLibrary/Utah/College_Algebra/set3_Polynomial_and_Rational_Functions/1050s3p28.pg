You are working in a room whose long side runs south to north.  The
room is $L feet long, and $W feet wide.  You have an exquisitely
accurate laser range finder that tells you that the distance from the
lower southwest corner to the upper northeast corner of the room is
\(\sqrt{$S}\) feet.  The height of the room is 
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet.
