TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
At a party, your friend tells you that her banker told her that
her investment will $BBOLD triple$EBOLD in $d years.  Her annual interest rate is
\{ans_rule(20) \}  percent.

EOT

ANS(num_cmp((3**(1/$d)-1)*100));

$a = (int((3**(1/$d)-1)*100)*1000)/1000;

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Write down an equation in \(p\) and take both
sides to a suitable power.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
We have to solve the equation
\[\left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)^{$d} = 3.\]
Tanking both sides to the power \(\frac{1}{d}\), subtracting 1, and multiplying with 100 gives the answer:

\[p = 100 \left(3^{\frac{1}{$d}}-1\right) \approx $a $DOLLAR.\]
