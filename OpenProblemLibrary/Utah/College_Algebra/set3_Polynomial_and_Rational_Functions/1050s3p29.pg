TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This delightful problem is taken from a collection of 200 "problem
solving cards" designed for eighth grade.  It's the hardest problem of
that set, but of course you are well beyond eighth grade!
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/1050/bb200.gif",
"Consult the original card here")\}.  The problem statement below does not say
that the tank is lying on one of its three sides, but it's clear from the
picture on the card.

$BR$BR
A fuel storage tank is in the shape of an equilateral triangular prism.
The prism is 8 feet high and 10 feet long.  When the tank is half-full, 
the depth of the fuel is  \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet.

ANS(num_cmp((1-1/sqrt(2))*8));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD It does not really help that the height of
the tank is a specific number, so let's suppose it's \(h\).  Clearly
the length of the tank is irrelevant, and it's enough to look at the
area of a vertical cross section.  This is a triangle, and we ask when
is half of it covered with fuel.  If the tank is half full to a depth
\(d\), say, then the upper part of it is a similar triangle with
height \(h-d\) whose area is one half of that of the overall triangle.
The areas of similar triangles relate like the squares of the
heights (since base and height are multiplied by the same factor).
Thus we have the equation

\[\frac{(h-d)^2}{h^2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]

We can solve this equation for \(d\), giving \[d =
\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)h.\] For the particular height given
in the problem, the depth of the half full tank is
\[d=8-8\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \hbox{~feet} \approx 2.343
\hbox{~feet}.\]
