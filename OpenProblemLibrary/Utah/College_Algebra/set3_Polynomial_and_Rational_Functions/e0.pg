TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

  The purpose of this special problem is to help you prepare for Exam 1.
It will take place Tuesday, January 31, in our regular classroom.  

  You can use a calculator, but no notes or books.  All you need to
bring to the exam is you calculator and a writing utensil.  We'll
spend the whole 50 minutes on the exam.  I won't be able to answer
questions during the exam.

  This WeBWorK question does contain some mathematical questions, but
their purpose is only to outline the subject covered on the exam.
The exam will not just contain the same questions with different
numbers!  However, if you go over this outline, revisit Appendix A in
the textbook, go over your notes, and make sure you understand
everything you'll do just fine on the exam.

  Review the following topics:

$BR

$BR The language of the number system, including: natural numbers,
integers, rational numbers, real numbers, addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, add, subtract, multiply, divide.

$PAR Fill in the missing word in this sentence:  The most general kind of numbers we have considered in this class so far are 
 \{ ans_rule(4) \} numbers.

$BR The concept of the real number line, including inequalities,
intervals, absolute values.

$PAR Fill in the following equation: \(\big|3 - |-4| \big| = \) \{
ans_rule(4) \}.


$BR The laws governing powers.  Know how to combine and evaluate powers.

$PAR For example, in the equation \(\big(\left(u^3\right)^2 \times
u^4\big)^{1\over 2} = u^n\) where \(n=\) \{ans_rule(4) \}.  (Here you
need to enter an actual number, not just an arithmetic expression.)

$PAR Also, complete the following equation by entering a fraction:
\(27^{-2/3} =\) \{ ans_rule(4) \}.


$BR The concept of polynomials, how to write them in standard form,
and how to add and multiply them.  Know the meaning of the terms
degree, leading coefficient, leading term, constant term, linear,
quadratic, cubic, quartic, and quintic.

$PAR For example, the polynomial \(p(x) = (x+2)(x-3)+(2x-1)(3x-2) \) can be written in standard form as 
\[p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \] where 
\(a =\)  \{ ans_rule(4) \}, 
\(b =\)  \{ ans_rule(4) \}, and
\(c =\)  \{ ans_rule(4) \}.

$PAR Let \(q(x) = 17x^{12} + 3x^2 - 5.\)  Then the degree of \(q\) is
  \{ ans_rule(4) \}, it's leading coefficient is 
  \{ ans_rule(4) \}, and its constant term is
  \{ ans_rule(4) \}.

$BR Similarly, the concept of rational functions.

For example, the function

\[r(x) = \frac{2x-1}{3x+2}-\frac{4x+3}{x^2+1}\]

can be written as 
\[r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\]
where the leading coefficient of \(p\) is 2, 
\(p(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} and
\(q(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}.



$BR Solving Linear Equations.

$PAR For example, the solution of the equation 
\(\frac{x+3}{2x+1} = 2\) is 
\(x = \)  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.


$BR Solving Quadratic Equations.

$PAR For example, the quadratic equation
\[6x^2 -7x -20 =0\]  has two solutions.  The larger one is
\(x=\)  \{ ans_rule(20) \}.


$BR Manipulating and Solving Inequalities.

$PAR For example, the inequality
\[2x+4 > 5x-3\] is equivalent to the 
inequality
$PAR
\(x \)  \{ ans_rule(1) \} \{ ans_rule(3) \}.
$PAR
Here, in the first answer box you should enter either \(<\) or \(>\), and
in the second answer box you should enter a fraction.


$BR There will also be a simple word problem, leading to a quadratic
or linear equation.
