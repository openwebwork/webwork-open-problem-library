You need to get all answers correct before receiving credit.  All answers need to
be decimal expressions.

You are growing bacteria.  From your initial experiments you know that
these particular bacteria double the size of their population every three 
hours in the presence of unlimited resources.  You start with a
population of \(1\) unit and you let them
grow in an environment that allows a stable population of 500 units.
You model the size of your population with a logistic curve.
Accordingly, the size of your population in your chosen units after
\(x\) hours is given by
\[f(x) = \frac{a}{1+be^{-rx}}\] where
$BR
\(a=\)  \{ ans_rule(10) \},

EOT
ANS(num_cmp(500, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\( b = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(499, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\( r = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \},  $BR and the population after \(24\) hours is
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(log(2)/3, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\( f(24) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} units. $BR After two days the population is
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(500/(1+499*exp(-log(2)*8)), mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\( f(48) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} units. 
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(500/(1+499*exp(-log(2)*16)), mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD First compute \(r\), then \(a\), and then \(b\).
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD \(r\) is such that the population doubles
every three hours.  Thus it is the solution of
\[e^{3r} = 2,\]
in other words, \[r = \frac{\ln 2}{3}.\]
\(a\) is the eventual population, i.e., \[a = 500.\]
At time \(0\) the population is 
\[f(0) = \frac{500}{ 1 + b} = 1\]
Hence \[1+b = 500,\]
or \[b = 499.\]
