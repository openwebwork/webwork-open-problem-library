The $BITALIC logistic curve$EITALIC is the
graph of the function \[f(x) = \frac{a}{1+be^{-rx}} \] where \(a\),
\(b\), and \(r\) are suitable parameters.

$BR

This function may describe, for example, the initial rapid growth of a
population, followed by a slowdown of the growth as resources become
sparse.  Since \(e^{-rx}\) tends to zero as \(x\) tends to infinity
\(f(x)\) approaches \(a\) as \(x \) tends to infinity, and at \(x=0\)
the initial population equals \[f(0) = \frac{a}{1+b}.\] The rate \(r\)
is the usual growth rate that would prevail indefinitely in the
presence of unlimited resources.



$BR
$BR

Suppose \(a=$a\), \(b = $b\), and \(r=0.01\).  
Then the initial population is 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} and as time goes on the population approaches 
but never quite reaches \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
