TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


On your next vacation in Siberia you come across a recently excavated
frozen mammoth where the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 is
\(4.78\times 10^{-14}\).  That mammoth died approximately 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} years ago.

EOT

ANS(num_cmp(-8223*log(0.0478), mode=>"strict"));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We need to solve the equation
\[e^{-t/8223} = 0.0478.\]
Taking the natural logarithm and multiplying with 8223
gives \[t=-8223\ln(0.0478) \approx 25004 \hbox{~years.}\]
(WeBWorK will accept \(25,000\)  as  a correct answer.)
