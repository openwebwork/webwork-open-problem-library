TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
  The brightness \(B\) of a star, called its
"apparent magnitude" \(m\), is expressed on a logarithmic scale:
\[B = a^{-m} B_0\] where \[a=\root 5 \of 100 \approx 2.511886432\] and
\(B_0\) is a reference brightness. Notice the minus sign in the
exponent, the smaller \(m\) the brighter is the object!  For example,
the star Vega has an apparent magnitude close to zero.  The dimmest
stars visible to the naked eye have an apparent magnitude close to
six.  The brightest star in the sky, Sirius, has an apparent magnitude
of \(-1.4\) and Venus may be as bright as \(-4.4\) (depending on its
distance and phase).

$BR

The full moon has an apparent magnitude of \(-12.6\).  It is 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} times as bright as Sirius.

EOT

ANS(num_cmp($a**(12.6-1.4), mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

$BR

 The sun is  449,000 times as bright as the full moon,
thus its apparent magnitude is  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.

EOT

$ans=-12.6-log(449000)/log($a);
