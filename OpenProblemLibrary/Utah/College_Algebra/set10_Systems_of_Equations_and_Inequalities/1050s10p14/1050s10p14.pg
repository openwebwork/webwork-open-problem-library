TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose we are concerned with the function
\[f(x) = 2^x.\]  We can evaluate \(f\) at natural numbers \(x\).
Indeed,

$BR


$BR  \(f(1) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR  \(f(2) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(4, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR  \(f(3) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \},
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(8, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR  \(f(4) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \},
$BR
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(16, mode=>"strict"));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR
We are going to approximate \(f\) by three polynomials, of degrees 1,
2, and 3.  Let's call them \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\),
respectively.

$BR

\(p_1\) will be determined by the requirement that
\[p_1(1) = f(1) \quad \hbox{and}\quad p_1(4) = f(4).\]


$BR

\(p_2\) will be determined by the requirement that
\[p_2(1) = f(1), ~p_2(3) = f(3) \quad \hbox{and}\quad p_2(4) = f(4).\]

$BR

\(p_3\) will be determined by the requirement that
\[p_3(1) = f(1), ~p_3(2) = f(2), ~p_3(3) = f(3) \quad \hbox{and}\quad p_3(4) = f(4).\]

$BR

Thus \(p_1\) is simply the linear function whose graph passes through the
points \((1,2)\) and \((4,16)\).

In fact,

$BR \(p_1(x) = \)  \{ans_rule(20)\}.


\(p_2\) is the quadratic function whose graph intersects the graph of
\(f\) in the points \((1,2)\), \((3,8)\), and \((4,16)\).  
\(p_3\) is the cubic function whose graph intersects the graph of
\(f\) in the points \((1,2)\), \((2,4)\), \((3,8)\), and \((4,16)\).  

$BR



The idea is illustrated in this Figure:

\{image("1050s10p14.gif", height => 512, width => 512);\} 

$BR
The graph of \(f(x) = 2^x\) is shown in red.  The graph of \(p_1\) is
green,
that of \(p_2\) is yellow, and that of \(p_3\) is blue.  The blue
graph is mostly covered up by the red graph, which indicates how
closely the cubic polynomial \(p_3\) approximates the exponential
\(f\), particularly in the interval \([1,4]\).
