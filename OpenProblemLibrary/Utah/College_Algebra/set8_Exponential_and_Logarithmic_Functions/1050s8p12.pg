TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

Suppose you have a population (of some species, it doesn't matter
which) that, over a long period, grows at a rate that causes it to
double its size every 30 years.  That rate is
 \{ ans_rule(20) \} percent.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp($p));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
Suppose that in the year 2004, that population is 
1,000,000.


$BR
$BR
$BR The population will be  \{ ans_rule(10) \} in the year 2034.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(2000000));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
$BR The population was \{ ans_rule(10) \}  in the year 1974.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(500000));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
$BR It was \{ ans_rule(10) \}  in the year 1944.
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(250000));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
$BR In the year \(t\) the population is \(f(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(20)
\}.  (Your answer will depend on \(t\).  Make sure you have the term
\(t-2004\) somewhere in an exponent.
$BR
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("1000000*2**((t-2004)/30)", limits=>[[2003,2005]], vars=>["t"]));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD  Use a formula of the form
\(f(t) = A2^{B(t-2004)},\) with suitable values of \(A\) and \(B\).
EOT



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
It's easy to check that 
\[f(t) = 10^6\times2^{(t-2004)/30}.\]
