TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 

Currently (as of January, 2007), the largest known prime number is
\[P= 2^{$p} - 1.\]

$BR

It has    \{ ans_rule(20) \} decimal digits.  (You must enter the correct integer.)

ANS(num_cmp($dig, tol => 0.5, mode => 'strict'));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Compute the base 10 logarithm of \(P\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
Ignoring the subtraction of 1, we have:
\[\hbox{log}_{10}(P)  \approx 2\times $p\hbox{log}_{10}(2) \approx 
$dig\]

Numbers with 1 decimal digit have a base 10 logarithm between 0.1 and
1, numbers with 2 have logarithms between 1 and 10, etc, i.e., \(P\)
has $dig decimal digits.  You
\{htmlLink("http://mersenne.org/prime9.txt","can see them all right
here")\} You may have a psychedelic experience scrolling those digits
across your screen.  If the last digit is even, then the transmission
was accidentally truncated!

$BR This prime number was found by the $BR
\{htmlLink("http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm", "Great Internet
Mersenne Prime Search")\} which has thousands of participants
contributing otherwise unused computing cycles. It's a fascinating
project and if you participate you have a chance to be the discoverer
of the next largest known prime number.  If you are the first to
discover a prime with more than 10 million digits you get to share a
prize of $DOLLAR 100,000,000.
