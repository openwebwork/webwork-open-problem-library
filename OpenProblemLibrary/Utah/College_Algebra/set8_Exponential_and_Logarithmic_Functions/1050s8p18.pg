Suppose \[A(m) = \left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m.\]

$BR As discussed in class, \(A(m)\) approaches \[e = 2.71828183\ldots\]
as \(m\) increases without bounds.  This exercise illustrates that
fact.  You'll need to enter numerical values of \(e-A(m)\) that are
correct to 4 digits (after the initial zeros).  You can compute them
with your calculator, and you may find it convenient to use
scientific format.  Note how the difference of \(e\) and \(A(m)\)
approaches zero, and \(A(m)\) approaches \(e\) as \(m\) grows.

$BR

If you are curious you can see
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/math/e.html","the first
10,000 digits of e")\} here.
