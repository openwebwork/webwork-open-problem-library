The next few questions are about fractions. You'll be asked to compute
a fraction and reduce it to lowest terms.  Note that since there are
two parts to the answer you will need to press the submit button below
to have your answer evaluated.




$BR
The expression \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}
\) is a fraction
\(\frac{a}{b}\) 
where \(b\) is positive, and \(a\) and \(b\) have no common factors.


$BR Enter
a=\{ ans_rule(20) \}
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(5, mode=>"strict"));
