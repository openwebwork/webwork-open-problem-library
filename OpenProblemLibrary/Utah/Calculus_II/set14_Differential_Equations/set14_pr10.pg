BEGIN_TEXT
An alternating current \( E(t) = 120\sin(12t) \) has been running through a
simple circuit for a long time. The circuit has an inductance of \( L = $L \) henrys, a
resistor of \( R = $R  \)ohms and a capacitor of capcitance \( C = $C \) farads. 
$BR
What  is the
amplitude of the current \( I \)?
