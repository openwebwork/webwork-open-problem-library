A spring with a spring constant \(k\) of 20 pounds per foot
is loaded with a 10-pound weight and allowed to reach equilibrium.
It is then displaced 1 foot downward and released.
If the weight experiences a retarding force in pounds equal to
four times the velocity at every point, find the equation of
motion.

\( y(t) = \) \{ans_rule(80)\} $BR
where \(t\) is time (in seconds) and \(y(t)\) is displacement (in feet).
