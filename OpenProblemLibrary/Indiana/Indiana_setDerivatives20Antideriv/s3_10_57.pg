SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
To solve this problem, one must remember the relationship between
position at time \( t \) (\( s(t) \)), instantaneous velocity
at time \( t \) (\( v(t) \)), and acceleration at time \( t\) (\(a(t)\)).
This relationship is given by:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) & = s'(t) \\
    a(t) & = v'(t) = s''(t) \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
With this in mind, this problem becomes an exercise in finding
antideriviatives.  We are told that the the acceleration due to gravity
is -32 feet per second squared, so that the function \( a(t) = -32 \).
Throughout this problem, it is important to remember which way is up.  That
is, negative values mean the object is accelerating or moving down, positive
values mean it is accelerating or moving up.  With this in mind, we need to compute
the formula for the velocity of the stone at time \( t \).
$PAR
Since the acceleration function is \( a(t) = -32 \), the velocity function is the
general antiderivative of this, or \( v(t) = -32t + C_1 \) where \( C_1 \) is a
constant.  We are told that the initial speed of the stone is $v1 feet per second 
downward, or -$v1 feet per second.  Therefore, \( v(0) = -32(0) + C_1 = -$v1 
\Rightarrow C_1 = -$v1 \).  Hence, the formula for the instantaneous velocity 
at time \( t \) is \( v(t) = -32t-$v1 \).
$PAR
Finally, we need to find a formula for the position of the stone at time \( t \).
Taking the antiderivative of the velocity, we get \( s(t) = -16t^2-{$v1}t+C_2 \)
where \( C_2 \) is again an unknown constant.  However, we are told that the height
of the building, and thus the initial height of the stone (we can assume that the
person doing the throwing is arbitrarily short) is $s1 feet.  Therefore,
\( s(0) = -16(0)^2 - {$v1}(0) + C_2 = $s1 \Rightarrow C_2 = $s1 \).  And, our
formula for position at time \(t\) is \(s(t) = -16t^2-{$v1}t+$s1 \).
$PAR
Putting this all to gether to answer the three questions posed, we get the following
answers: (Recall that for part B, we are only insterested in the positive solution)
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \mbox{A. } s($t1) & = -16($t1)^2 - {$v1}($t1) + $s1 = $ans1 \\
    \\
    \mbox{B. } s(t) & = -16t^2 - {$v1}t + $s1 = 0 \\
              t & = \frac{$v1 - \sqrt{(-$v1)^2-4(-16)($s1)}}{2(-16)} \\
                & = !{$ans2:%5.3f} \\
    \\
    \mbox{C. } v(!{$ans2:%5.3f}) & = -32(!{$ans2:%5.3f}) - $v1 \\
                       & = !{$ans3:%5.3f} \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
