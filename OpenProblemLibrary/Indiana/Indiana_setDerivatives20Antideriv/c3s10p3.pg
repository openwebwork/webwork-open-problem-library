SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
First, recall the relationship between position, 
instantaneous velocity, and instantaneous acceleration.  If 
\( s(t) \) is the position of the ball at time t (i.e. the height), \( v(t) \) 
the velocity, and \( a(t) \) the acceleration, then:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) & = s'(t) \\
    a(t) & = v'(t) = s''(t)
  \end{aligned}
\]

So in our specific problem, we are reminded that the acceleration due to
gravity is a constant 32 ft per second squared, in the negative direction.
So, we know that \( a(t) = -32 \).  In order to find out how high the ball
goes, we will need to first find out what the formula for instantaneous
velocity looks like.  Using the relationship above, and the fact that
the antiderivative of a constant \( D \) is \( Dx + C \) for another 
constant \( C \), we get:

\[
  v(t) = -32t + C_1
\]

To find the constant \( C_1 \), notice that we are told that the initial
velocity of the ball is \(!{$initialSpeed}\) ft/sec. Therefore, \(v(0) =
-32(0) + C_1 = C_1 = $initialSpeed\).  So, the formula for velocity is:

\[
  v(t) = -32t + $initialSpeed
\]

Now, we need to find the formula for the position of the ball.  This is \(
s(t) \), the antiderivative of the velocity formula we just found.  Using
the general rules for finding antiderivatives, we see that:

\[
  s(t) = -16t^2 + {$initialSpeed}t + C_2
\]

Again, we need to find out what the constant, \( C_2 \) in this case, is
equal to.  We can assume that the ball is shot from the ground, which is at
height 0.  Therefore, the initial height of the ball, \( s(0) \), is 0
making the constant \( C_2 = 0 \).  Therefore, the final formula for
position is:

\[
  s(t) = -16t^2+{$initialSpeed}t
\]

Finally, to find out how high the ball goes, we need to think about what
happens when the ball reaches its maximum height.  At that point, the ball
will pause for just an instant before starting to fall back to the ground.
It that instant, the velocity of the ball is 0.  So, if we determine the
time at which the ball has velocity 0, and then find its height at that
time, we will know how high the ball goes.
$PAR
To find out when the velocity of the ball is 0, we set the velocity formula
equal to 0 and compute as follows:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) &= 0 \\
    -32t + $initialSpeed &= 0 \\
    32t &= $initialSpeed \\
    t &= \frac{$initialSpeed}{32} = !{$topTime:%5.4f}
  \end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the maximum height of the ball is:

\[
  s(!{$topTime:%5.4f}) =
  -16(!{$topTime:%5.4f})^2+{$initialSpeed}(!{$topTime:%5.4f}) = !{$height:%5.4f}
\]
