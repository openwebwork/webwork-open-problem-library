Consider the function \( f(x) \) whose second derivative is
\( f''(x) = $a1 x + $b1 \sin (x) \). If \( f(0) = $n1\) and
 \( f'(0) = $m1\), what is  \( f(  $p1 ) \)? \{ans_rule(30) \}

$ans = $a1 * ($p1)**3/6 - $b1 * sin($p1) +($m1+$b1)*$p1 +$n1;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
This problem has two parts.  The first is finding the function \( f'(x) 
\) based on the given function \( f''(x) \) and the information given 
about \( f'(0) \).  The second part is using this function and the 
information given about \( f(0) \) to find the function \( f(x) \).  We 
can then just plug in the point $p1 to find the desired value.
$PAR
Recall that the derivative of \( \cos(x)\) is \( -\sin(x) \).  Therefore, 
the general antiderivative of \($a1 x + $b1 \sin (x) \) is going to
be:
$PAR
\[
   f'(x) = \frac{$a1}{2}x^2 - $b1 \cos(x) + C_1
\]
Now, since \( f'(0) = $m1 \) we plug 0 in and solve for \( C_1 \) to find
the specific antiderivative.  This yeilds:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    f'(0) & = $m1 \\
    \frac{$a1}{2}(0)^2 - $b1 \cos(0) + C_1 & = $m1 \\
    -$b1 + C_1&  = $m1 \\
    C_1 & = $m1 + $b1 = \{ $m1+$b1\} \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
Therefore, the formula \( f'(x) \) is given by \( f'(x) = 
\frac{$a1}{2}x^2 - $b1\cos(x) + \{ $m1+$b1 \} \).
$PAR
Now, on to part two.  We again take the antiderivative of this, this time 
recalling that the derivative of \( \sin(x) \) is \( \cos(x) \).  
Therefore, the general antiderivative of \( f'(x) \) is given by:
$PAR
\[
  f(x) = \frac{$a1}{2(3)}x^3 - $b1\sin(x) + \{$m1+$b1\}x + C_2
\]
$PAR
Again, using the information we have about \( f(0) \), we find the specific
function \( f(x) \) by solving for \( C_2 \).
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    f(0) & = $n1 \\
    \frac{$a1}{6}(0)^3 - $b1\sin(0) + \{$m1+$b1\}(0) + C_2 & = 0 \\
    C_2 & = $n1 \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
Therefore, the function \(f(x) \) is given by:
$PAR
\[
  f(x) = \frac{$a1}{6}x^3 - $b1\sin(x) + \{$m1+$b1\}x + $n1
\]
$PAR
We now plug in $p1 to get:
$PAR
\[
  f($p1) = \frac{$a1}{6}($p1)^3 - $b1\sin($p1) + \{$m1+$b1\}($p1) + $n1	
         = !{$ans%5.2f}
\]
