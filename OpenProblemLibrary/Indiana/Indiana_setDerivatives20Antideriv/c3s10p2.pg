A car traveling at \(!{$initialSpeed}\) ft/sec decelerates at a
constant \(!{$decelerationRate}\) feet per second per second.  How many feet does the
car travel before coming to a complete stop?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
First, recall the relationship between position, 
instantaneous velocity, and instantaneous acceleration.  If 
\( s(t) \) is the position of the car at time t, \( v(t) \) 
the velocity, and \( a(t) \) the acceleration, then:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) & = s'(t) \\
    a(t) & = v'(t) = s''(t)
  \end{aligned}
\]

So in our specific problem, we are told that the car decelerates at a constant
rate of !{decelerationRate} feet per second per second.  As this is deceleration
and not acceleration, the function for acceleration becomes \( a(t) = 
-$decelerationRate \). Then, using antiderivitives, we can find an 
expression for the velocity of a car at time \( t \).  This is give by:

\[ a(t) = \frac{d}{dt} v(t) 
        = \frac{d}{dt} \big( -!{$decelerationRate}t + C_1 \big) \]

Since we know that the car has an initial velocity of $initialSpeed, this means
that at time \( t = 0 \) the velocity \(v(0) = $initialSpeed \).  Using this, 
we solve for \( C_1 \) in our velocity expression as follows:

\[ 
  \begin{aligned}
    v(0) &= -!{$decelerationRate}(0) + C_1 \\
    $initialSpeed &= C_1
  \end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the expression for velocity is \( v(t) = 
-!{$decelerationRate}t + $initialSpeed \).  We can now use this
to compute the position function.

\[ v(t) = \frac{d}{dt} s(t) 
        = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{$decelerationRate}{2}t^2 + 
           !{$initialSpeed}t + C_2 \right) \]

Now we want to know how far the car traveled between time \( t = 0 \) and 
the time when it stopped.  So we can assume that the car started at position
0.  Therefore, \( s(0) = 0 \) giving \(s(t) = -\frac{$decelerationRate}{2}t^2 
+ !{$initialSpeed}t \).  The car stopped when its velocity was zero, or
when:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) &= 0 \\
    -!{$decelerationRate}t + $initialSpeed &= 0 \\
    t &= \frac{$initialSpeed}{$decelerationRate} \\
    t &=  !{$stopTime:%5.3f}
  \end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the total distance traveled was:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    s(!{$stopTime:%5.3f}) &= -\frac{$decelerationRate}{2}(!{$stopTime:%5.3f})^2
      + !{$initialSpeed}(!{$stopTime:%5.3f}) \\
      &=  !{$distance:%6.4f}
  \end{aligned}
\]
