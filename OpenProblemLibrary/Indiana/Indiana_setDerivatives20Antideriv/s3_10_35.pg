SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR

This problem is just an exercise in finding antiderivatives.  The catch 
is that the information is given in terms of graphs instead of function
formulas.  Recall that the graph of \( f(x) \) going through the point 
\( ($a1, $b1) \), this simply means \( f($a1) = $b1 \).  Similarly,
the slope of the tangent line at \( x, f(x) \) being \( {$c1}x + $d1 \) means
that the derivative of \( f \) at \( x \) is this formula.  That is, 
\( f'(x) = {$c1}x + $d1 \).
$PAR
Now, we find the antiderivative of \( f'(x) = {$c1}x + $d1 \).  This is
given by \( f(x) = \frac{$c1}{2}x^2 + {$d1}x + C \).  The fact that
\( f($a1) = $b1 \) allows us to solve for \( C \) as follows.
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    f($a1) & = $b1 \\
    \frac{$c1}{2}($a1)^2 + {$d1}($a1) + C & = $b1 \\
    \frac{$c1}{2}(\{$a1**2\}) + \{ $d1*$a1 \} + C & = $b1 \\
    \frac{\{$c1*$a1**2\}}{2} + C & = $b1 - \{$d1*$a1\} \\
    C & = \{ $b1-$d1*$a1 \}-\{($c1*$a1**2)/2\} \\
    C & = $c \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) is given by:
$PAR
\[
  f(x) = \frac{$c1}{2}x^2 + {$d1}x + ($c)
\]
$PAR
Plugging in the point $p1, gives \( f($p1) = !{$ans:%5.2f} \).
