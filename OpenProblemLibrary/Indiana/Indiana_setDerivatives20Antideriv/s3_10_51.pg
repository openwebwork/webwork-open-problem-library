A particle is moving with acceleration \( a(t) = $a1 t + $b1 \).
its position at time \( t =0 \) is \( s(0) = $d1 \) and
its velocity at time \( t =0 \) is \( v(0) = $c1 \).
What is its position at time \( t = $t1 \)? \{ans_rule(30) \}

$ans = $a1*$t1**3/6 + $b1*$t1**2/2 + $c1*$t1 + $d1;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
To solve this problem, one must remember the relationship between 
position at time \( t \) (\( s(t) \)), instantaneous velocity 
at time \( t \) (\( v(t) \)), and acceleration at time \( t\) (\(a(t)\)).
This relationship is given by:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) & = s'(t) \\
    a(t) & = v'(t) = s''(t) \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
With this in mind, this problem becomes an exercise in finding 
antideriviatives.  We are told that the acceleration is given
by \( a(t) = {$a1}t + $b1 \).  The antiderivative (velocity) of
this is therefore given by \( v(t) = \frac{$a1}{2}t^2+{$b1}t+C_1 \).
To find out what the constant \( C_1 \) is, we use the fact that the 
velocity of the partical at time \( t = 0 \) is given by \( v(0) = $c1 \).
Plugging this into our general antiderivative and solving for \( C_1 \) 
yeilds the following.
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(0) & = $c1 \\
    \frac{$a1}{2}(0)^2 + {$b1}(0) + C_1 & = $c1 \\
    C_1 & = $c1 \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
So, the expression for the velocity of the partical at time \( t \) is
given by \( v(t) = \{$a1/2\}t^2 + {$b1}t + $c1 \).  Now, we need to find
the formula for the partical's position, which is just the antiderivative
of this.  The general antiderivative of this is \( s(t) = \frac{ 
\{$a1/2\} }{3}t^3 + \frac{$b1}{2}t^2 + {$c1}t + C_2 \) where \( C_2 \) is 
again an unknown constant.  However, as before, we can make use of the 
inforamation given, namely that the position of the partical at time \( t 
= 0 \) is \( s(0) = $d1 \), to find the value of \( C_2 \).
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    s(0) & = $d1 \\
    \{$a1/6\}(0)^3 + \{$b1/2\}(0)^2 + {$c1}(0) + C_2 & = $d1 \\
    C_2 & = $d1 \\
  \end{aligned}
\]
Therefore, the formula for the partical's position is:
$PAR
\[ 
  s(t) = \{$a1/6\}t^3 + \{$b1/2\}t^2+{$c1}t+$d1
\]
$PAR
So, the partical's position at time \( t = $t1 \) is found by simply 
plugging $t1 into the function \( s(t) \).  This is \( s($t1) = $ans \).
