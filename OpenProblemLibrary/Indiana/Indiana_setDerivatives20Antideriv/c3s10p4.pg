SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
First, recall the relationship between position, instantaneous velocity, and
instantaneous acceleration.  If \( s(t) \) is the position of the ball at
time t (i.e. the height), \( v(t) \) the velocity, and \( a(t) \) the 
acceleration, then:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v(t) & = s'(t) \\
    a(t) & = v'(t) = s''(t)
  \end{aligned}
\]

As the ball is shot at an angle in this example, there are two things
happening.  First of all, there is velocity, acceleration, and position
along the vertical axis.  That is, along a line going straight up from the
ground.  Secondly, there is velocity and position along the horizontal
axis, or parallel to the ground.  We will analyze these two cases separately.
$PAR
$HR$PAR

Part I:
$PAR
In the first part, we will analyze the ball's movement along the vertical
axis.  The acceleration due to gravity is 32 feet per second squared
downwards, so the acceleration along the vertical axis is given by 
\( a_v(t) = -32 \).  The velocity along the vertical axis is the
antiderivative of the acceleration, or \( v_v(t) = -32t + C_1 \) where 
\( C_1 \) is a constant.  To find that constant, we need to know something
about the initial speed of the ball along the vertical axis.
$PAR
We are told that the initial velocity of the ball is $initialSpeed ft/sec
vector pointing upwards at a 45 degree angle, or at \( \frac{\pi}{4} \)
radians.  We want the initial speed along the vertical axis, so we need to
take the sine component. This is \($initialSpeed \times \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) =
!{$speedUp:%5.4f} \) will the the initial speed along the vertical axis.  
Therefore, our velocity formula becomes:
\[
  v_v(t) = -32t + !{$speedUp:%5.4f}
\]
Now, we need to find the formula for the height of the ball, which is the
poisition along the vertical axis.  This is \( s_v(t) \), the antiderivative
of the velocity formula we just found.  Using the general rules for finding 
antiderivatives, we see that:
\[
  s(t) = -16t^2 + !{$speedUp:%5.4f}t + C_2
\]
To find out what the constant, \( C_2 \), is equal to, we note that
the ball is shot from the ground, so the initial height is 0.  Therefore, 
\( s(0) = C_2 = 0 \).  Hence, the final formula for height is:
\[
  s_v(t) = -16t^2+!{$speedUp:%5.4f}t
\]
Finally, to find out how high the ball goes, we need to think about what
happens when the ball reaches its maximum height.  At that point, the ball
will pause for just an instant before starting to fall back to the ground.
It that instant, the velocity of the ball along the vertical axis is 0.
So, if we determine the time at which the ball has velocity 0, and then 
find its height at that time, we will know how high the ball goes.
$PAR
To find out when the velocity of the ball is 0, we set the velocity formula
equal to 0 and compute as follows:
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    v_v(t) &= 0 \\
    -32t + !{$speedUp:%5.4f} &= 0 \\
    32t &= !{$speedUp:%5.4f} \\
    t &= \frac{!{$speedUp:%5.4f}}{32} = !{$topTime:%5.4f}
  \end{aligned}
\]
Therefore, the maximum height of the ball is:
\[
  s(!{$topTime:%5.4f}) =
  -16(!{$topTime:%5.4f})^2+!{$speedUp:%5.4f}(!{$topTime:%5.4f}) = !{$height:%5.4f}
\]
$PAR
$HR$PAR

Part II:
$PAR
For the second part of the question, we can use a similar process as in part
I, but instead we want to see what happens along the horizontal axis.  Note
that the acceleration due to gravity is entirely along the vertical axis.  So
the acceleration along the horizontal axis, \( a_h(t) = 0 \).
$PAR
This means that the velocity formula parallel to the ground is the
antiderivative of this, or:
\[
  v_d(t) = C_3
\]
The initial velocity parallel to the ground, \( v(0) \) is given by finding
the initial speed along the vector parallel to the ground.  For this, we use
the cosine function to find the component of the initial speed which is
parallel to the ground.  This is \( !{$initialSpeed} \times \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) =
!{$speedOver:%5.4f} \).  Hence, our velocity function is:
\[
  v_h(t) = !{$speedOver:%5.4f}
\]
Then, we can use the antiderivative one more time, along with the fact that
the initial horizontal position of the ball can be thought of as 0, to get a
distance function:
\[
  s_h(t) = !{$speedOver:%5.4f}t
\]
The last thing we need to do is determine the exact time at which the ball
hits the ground.  For this, we go back to part I and use the height
function developed there, \( s_v(t) \).  The ball will hit the ground
when \( s_v(t) = 0 \).  Note that there are two times for which the height
is zero-when the ball is initially shot and when it hits the ground.  We are
interested in the latter.
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    s_v(t) &= 0 \\
    -16t^2+!{$speedUp:%5.4f}t &= 0 \\
    t(-16t+!{$speedUp:%5.4f}) &= 0 \\
    -16t+!{$speedUp:%5.4f} &= 0 \\
    t &= \frac{!{$speedUp:%5.4f}}{16} = !{$grndTime:%5.4f}
  \end{aligned}
\]
Therefore, the distance the ball traveled away from the point from which it
was shot is:
\[
  s_h(!{$grndTime:%5.4f}) = !{$speedOver:%5.4f}}(!{$grndTime:%5.4f}) = !{$distance:%5.4f}
\]
