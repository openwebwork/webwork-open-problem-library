SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
This is just an exercise in the rules of finding derivatives of 
polynomials.  It is, however, somewhat more difficult since we are 
working in terms of antiderivatives.  First, recall that the reason we 
call \( F(x) \) the antiderivative of \( f(x) \) is that the derivative 
of \(F(x)\) is \( f(x) \).  So in this case, let's find the derivative of 
\( F(x) \) with the constants A,B,C, and D in place.
$PAR
\[
   F'(x) = 4Ax^3 + 3Bx^2 + 2Cx + D
\]
$PAR
Now, matching this up with \( f(x) \), we see that we must have
the following equalities if \( f(x) \) is to be the derivative of \( F(x) \).
$PAR

\[ \parbox{0.4\texwidth}{
     \begin{aligned}
       $a1 & = 4A \\
       -$b1 & = 3B \\
       $c1 & = 2C \\
       -$d1 & = D \\
     \end{aligned}       }
 \]
 $PAR
 So solving, we get:
 $PAR
 \[ \parbox{0.4\textwidth}{
      \begin{aligned}
        A & = \frac{$a1}{4} = !{$ans1:%5.2f} \\
        B & = -\frac{$b1}{3} = !{$ans2:%5.2f} \\
        C & = \frac{$c1}{2} = !{$ans3:%5.2f} \\
        D & = $ans4 \\
      \end{aligned}      }
 \]
