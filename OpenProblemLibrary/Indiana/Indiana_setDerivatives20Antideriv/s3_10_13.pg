Consider the function \( f(t) =  $a1 \sec ^2(t) - $b1 t^ { $n1 }  \).
Let \( F(t) \) be the antiderivative of \( f(t) \) with \( F(0) = 0 \).  $BR
Then \( F($p1) =\) \{ans_rule(20) \}

$ans = $a1 * tan($p1) - $b1*$p1**($n1+1)/($n1+1);

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
To solve this problem, you need to recall that the derivative of 
\( \tan(t) \) is \( \sec^2(t) \).  It is not hard to derive this
using the identity \( \tan(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)} \) and the
quotient rule for deriviatives.
$PAR
With this in mind, we can use the rules for antiderivitives to
find the general antiderivative of \(f(t) =  $a1\sec^2(t)-{$b1}t^$n1 \).
It will be \(F(t) = $a1\tan(t) - \frac{ {$b1}t^\{$n1+1\} }{ \{ $n1+1 \}} + 
C \). Now using the information that \( F(0) = 0 \), we see that
since \( \tan(0) = 0 \), we must have \( C = 0 \).
$PAR
Therefore, plugging $p1 into this expression, we get:
$PAR
\[
    F($p1) = $a1\tan($p1) - \frac{ $b1($p1)^\{$n1+1\} }{ \{ $n1+1 \} }
           = !{$ans:%5.3f}
\]
