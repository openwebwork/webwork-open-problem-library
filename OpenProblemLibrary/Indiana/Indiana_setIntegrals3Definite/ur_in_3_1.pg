$SOL $BR
To find the displacement of the partical between times $t1 and $t2, we use the definite 
integral given below:
\[
  \int_{$t1}^{$t2} $ss t^2 - $f1 t + $f2
\]
Computing the antiderivative of the velocity function, we get:
\[
  s(t) = \frac{$ss t^3}{3}-\frac{$f1}{2}t^2+$f2 t + C
\]
Therefore, buy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the displacement is:
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    s($t2) - s($t1) &= \frac{$ss ($t2)^3}{3}-\frac{$f1}{2}($t2)^2 + $f2($t2) + C
                       -\frac{$ss ($t1)^3}{3}+\frac{$f1}{2}($t1)^2 - $f2($t1) - C \\
                    &= $ss (!{$Et2:%5.4f} - !{$Et1:%5.4f}) \\
                    &= !{$ans1:%5.4f} 
  \end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
Now, to find the total distance moved, we need to do something a bit harder.  If
\( v(t) \) is the velocity function, then the total distance traveled between
times $t1 and $t2 is given by:
\[
  \int_{$t1}^{$t2} \big| v(t) \big| dt
\]
$PAR
We don't have any nice way to compute the antiderivative of the absolute value, so 
we will need to determine on which subintervals the velocity function is positive, and 
on which subintervals it is negative.  Then, we can split the integral up and integrate 
\( v(x) \) on the positive integrals and \( -v(x) \) on the negative integrals.
$PAR

As \( v(t) = $ss t^2 - $f1 t + $f2 \), we can find where it changes from positive to negative
and vice-versa by solving for zero--the point where the function crosses the x-axis.  This
gives:
$PAR
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    $ss t^2 - $f1 t + $f2 &= 0 \\
    $ss(t - $a)(t - $b) &= 0 
  \end{aligned}
\]

So, either \( t = $a \) or \( t = $b \) will give \( v(t) = 0 \). Picking test points
and plugging them in to \( v(t) \) shows that the function is negative on the interval
($t1,$a), positive on the integral ($a,$b) and negative again on the interval ($b,$t2).

&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

So, either \( t = $a \) or \( t = $b \) will give \( v(t) = 0 \). Picking test points
and plugging them in to \( v(t) \) shows that the function is positive on the interval
($t1,$a), negative on the integral ($a,$b) and positive again on the interval ($b,$t2).

}

&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

So, the integral of the absolute value can be rewritten as:
\[
  $ss \int_{$t1}^{$a} v(t) dt - $ss \int_{$a}^{$b} v(t) dt + $ss \int_{$b}^{$t2} v(t) dt
\]
Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate, and using the antiderivative
computed above, we get:
\[
  \begin{aligned}
     $ss s($a) - $ss s($t1) - $ss s($b) + $ss s($a) + $ss s($t2) - $ss s($b) &= \\ \\
     $ss !{$Ea:%5.3f} - $ss !{$Et1:%5.3f} - $ss !{$Eb:%5.3f} + $ss !{$Ea:%5.3f} 
     + $ss !{$Et2:%5.3f} - $ss !{$Eb:%5.3f} &= !{$ans2:%5.3f}
  \end{aligned}
\]
