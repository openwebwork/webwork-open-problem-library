# We need a special problem grader on this problem, since we
# want the student to get full credit for all five answers correct,
# 50% credit for four correct, and 0% for three or fewer correct.
# To change this scheme, look through the following mess of code
# for the place where the variable $numright appears, and change
# that part.
# Also change the long line beginning "msg ==>", to show what will
# appear on the screen for the student.
#
# To look at the problem itself, look for the boxed comment below

Test each of the following series for convergence by the Integral Test.  (Don't use any other tests.)
If the Integral Test, by itself,  can be applied to the series to determine whether it converges, enter CONV if
it converges or DIV if it diverges.
If the integral test cannot be applied to the series, enter NA.

$PAR(Note: this means that even if you know a given series converges
by using some other test, or some other test combined with the integral test,
but the integral test, all by itself, does not determine the answer 
then you must enter NA rather than CONV.)  $PAR

&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
($j). The function \(f(x) = x e^{-$a x}\) is positive because
it is the quotient of two positive functions, \(x\) and \(e^{$a x}\).  It
is continuous because it is the quotient of two continuous functions,
and the denominator is never \(0\) on the given domain \([1,\infty)\).
It is decreasing because the denominator \(e^{$a x}\) grows exponentially,
faster than any polynomial including the numerator \(x\).
Thus the integral test will apply.  It requires integration by parts,
\( \int u dv = u v - \int v du \), with \(u = x\) and \(dv = e^{-$a x} dx\),
so that \(du = dx\) and \(v = e^{-$a x}\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^\infty x e^{-$a x} dx
&=	\left. x e^{-$a x} \right|_1^\infty - \int_{1}^\infty e^{-$a x} dx	\\\\
&=	\left( \lim_{x\to\infty} x e^{-$a x} - 1\cdot e^{-$a\cdot 1} \right)
		- \left(\frac{1}{-$a}\right) \int_{1}^\infty (-$a) e^{-$a x} dx	\\\\
&=	\left( 0 - e^{-$a} \right)
		+ \left. \frac{e^{-$a x}}{$a} \right|_1^\infty	\\\\
&=	-e^{-$a} + \left(
	\frac{\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\infty} e^{-$a x} - e^{-$a\cdot 1}}{$a} \right) \\\\
&=	-e^{-$a} + \frac{0 - e^{-$a}}{$a} = -e^{-$a} - \frac{e^{-$a}}{$a}
		= \left(1 - \frac{1}{$a}\right)e^{-$a}
\end{aligned}
\]
This integral converges, so this series converges.

EOT
}

if ($slice[$i] == 1) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
($j).  The function \(f(x) = x e^{$a x}\) is increasing because it is
the product of positive increasing functions.  Therefore it is not
a decreasing function, so the Integral Test does not apply, and
the correct answer is NA.

EOT
}

if ($slice[$i] == 2) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
($j). The function \(f(x) = \frac{\ln($d x)}{x}\) is continuous because it is the
quotient of two continuous functions, \(\ln($d x)\) and \(x\), and the
denominator is not \(0\) anywhere on the domain (\([1,\infty)\)).  It is
positive because \(\ln($d x)\) and \(x\) are positive on the same domain, and
it is decreasing because the logarithm grows slower than the linear function
\(x\).  So we may apply the Integral Test:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^\infty \frac{ln($d x)}{x} dx
&=	\frac{1}{$d} \int_{1}^\infty \left(\ln($d x)\right)^1
		\left(\frac{$d}{x}\right) dx	\\\\
&=	\frac{1}{$d} \left.
		\left(\frac{\left(\ln($d x)\right)^2}{2}\right) \right|_1^\infty	\\\\
&=	\frac{\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}
		\left(\ln($d x)\right)^2 - \left(\ln($d \cdot 1)\right)^2}
		{2\cdot $d}	\\\\
&=	\frac{\infty - \ln(2\cdot $d)}{2\cdot $d} = \infty
\end{aligned}
\]
The integral diverges, so the series diverges.

EOT
}

if ($slice[$i] == 3) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
($j).  The function \(f(x) = \frac{$b}{x\cdot \ln($c x)}\) is continuous because its
numerator is a constant and its denominator is the product of two continuous
functions, \(x\) and \(\ln($c x)\), neither of which is ever \(0\) on the
domain \([1,\infty)\).  It is positive because each of the aforementioned
constituent functions is positive on the given domain, and it is decreasing
because all the functions that make up the denominator are decreasing (with
the numerator constant).  So we can apply the integral test:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^\infty \frac{$b}{x\cdot \ln($c x)} dx
&=	\frac{$b}{$c} \int_{1}^\infty \frac{\frac{$c}{x}}{\ln($c x)} dx	\\\\
&=	\frac{$b}{$c} \left. \ln(\ln($c x)) \right|_1^\infty	\\\\
&=	\frac{$b}{$c} \left( \lim_{x\to\infty} \ln(\ln($c x))
		- \ln(\ln($c\cdot 1)) \right)	\\\\
&=	\frac{$b}{$c} \left( \infty - \ln(\ln($c\cdot 1)) \right) = \infty
\end{aligned}
\]
The integral diverges, so the series diverges.

EOT
}

if ($slice[$i] == 4) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
($j).  The function \(f(x) = \frac{$b}{x\left(\ln($c x)\right)^$m}\)
is continuous because its
numerator is a constant and its denominator is the product of two continuous
functions, \(x\) and \(\left(\ln($c x)\right)^$m\),
neither of which is ever \(0\) on the
domain \([1,\infty)\).  It is positive because each of the aforementioned
constituent functions is positive on the given domain, and it is decreasing
because all the functions that make up the denominator are decreasing (with
the numerator constant).  So we can apply the integral test:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{1}^\infty \frac{$b}{x\left(\ln($c x)\right)^$m} dx
&=	\frac{$b}{$c} \int_{1}^\infty \left(\ln($c x)\right)^{-$m}
		\left(\frac{$c}{x}\right) dx	\\\\
&=	\frac{$b}{$c} \left. \left(\frac{\left(\ln($c x)\right)^{-$m+1}}
		{-$m+1}\right) \right|_1^\infty	\\\\
&=	\frac{$b}{$c($soln_1mm)}
		\left( \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{\left(\ln($c x)\right)^$soln_mm1}
			- \frac{1}{\left(\ln($c)\right)^$soln_mm1} \right)	\\\\
&=	\frac{$b}{$c($soln_1mm)}
		\left( 0 - \frac{1}{\left(\ln($c)\right)^$soln_mm1} \right)	\\\\
&=	\frac{-$b}{$c($soln_1mm)\left(\ln(c)\right)^$soln_mm1}
\end{aligned}
\]
The integral converges, so the series converges.

EOT
}

if ($slice[$i] == 5) {
&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
($j).  The function \(f(x) = \frac{x+$f}{\left(-$g\right)^x}\) oscillates between
positive and negative values due to its denominator, so the integral test
does not apply directly, so NA is the correct answer.

$PAR (However the integral test can be used to show that the series converges $BBOLD absolutely
 $EBOLD, so the additional fact that $BQUOTE absolute convergence implies convergence $EQUOTE
shows that the series does, in fact, converge.)
