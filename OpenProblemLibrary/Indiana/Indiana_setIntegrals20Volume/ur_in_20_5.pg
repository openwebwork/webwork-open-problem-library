Clicking on the following image will show you the region, surrounded in
blue lines, that must be rotated.  The axis of rotation is shown as a red
line.  This will help you be sure you pictured or graphed the situation
accurately: $BR
$graphtext $BR $BR

Example 4 on p.444 can help remind you how to do this type of problem, if
it's been awhile since you've done rotation problems to calculate volume.
The idea is that each vertical slice of the object is a thick ring,
that is, a circle with an inner circle missing.  So its area can be
calculated by (area of outer circle) - (area of inner circle), which
simplifies to \(\pi\left(r_{outer}^2-r_{inner}^2\right)\). $BR $BR

So in this situation, the upper boundary of the region
forms the outer edge of the surface, because we're rotating
about an axis below the region.  Thus the outer radius at point
\(x\) is expressed by \(\cos($b x)+$a\), because that is the
distance from the axis of rotation to the x-axis plus the distance
from the x-axis to the top of the region (at point \(x\)).  And the inner
radius is simply the distance from the axis of rotation to the bottom of
the region, which is always $a, because the bottom of the region is the
line \(y=0\). $BR $BR

Thus the area becomes:
\[
\begin{aligned}
A(x)
&=	\pi \cdot r_{outer}^2 - \pi \cdot r_{inner}^2	\\\\
&=	\pi \left( r_{outer}^2 - r_{inner}^2 \right)	\\\\
&=	\pi \left[ \left( \cos($b x) + $a \right)^2 - $a^2 \right]	\\\\
&=	\pi \left[ \cos^2($b x) + $soln_2a \cos($b x) \right]
\end{aligned}
\]

And then we integrate to get the volume, and during this process we need
to use the technique taught in part (c) of the red Strategy box on the
top of page 478 in Stewart:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \pi\left(\cos^2($b x)+$soln_2a \cos($b x)\right)dx
&=	\pi \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \cos^2($b x)dx
		+ $soln_2a \pi \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \cos($b x)dx	\\\\
&=	\pi \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \frac 1 2
			\left( 1 + \cos($soln_2b x) \right) dx
		+ $soln_2a \pi \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \cos($b x) dx	\\\\
&=	\frac{\pi}{2} \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} dx
		+ \frac{\pi}{2} \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \cos($soln_2b x) dx
		+ $soln_2a \pi \int_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \cos($b x) dx	\\\\
&=	\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \left. x \right|_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \right)
		+ \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \left. \frac{\sin($soln_2b x)}{$soln_2b}
			\right|_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \right)
		+ $soln_2a \pi \left( \left. \frac{\sin($b x)}{$b}
			\right|_0^{\pi/$soln_2b} \right)	\\\\
&=	\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{$soln_2b} - 0 \right)
		+ \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{\sin(\pi)-\sin(0)}{$soln_2b}
			\right)
		+ $soln_2a \pi \left(
			\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)-\sin(0)}{$b}
			\right)	\\\\
&=	\frac{\pi^2}{$soln_4b} + 0 + \frac{$soln_2a \pi}{$b} = $soln
\end{aligned}
