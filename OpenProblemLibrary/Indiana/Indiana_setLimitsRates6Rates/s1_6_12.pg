SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
It is necessary to recall the relationship between position
(distance) and speed (velocity).  Velocity is a change in position.
So the instantaneous velocity at time \( t \), call it \( v(t) \),  is 
given by the change in position at time \( t \), call this \( s(t) \).  But 
the change in position at time \( t \) is just the slope of the tangent
line to the graph of the position function at the  point (t,s(t)),
which is \( s'(t) \), the derivative of \( s \) evaluated at \(t \).     
$PAR 
In this case, we have a formula for position given by 
\( s(t) = $v0 t - 0.83 t^2 \).  Therefore, the instantaneous
velocity at time \( t \) is given by \( v(t) = s'(t) = $v0 - 2(0.83 t) \).
Using this formula, the velocity after \( $t1 \) seconds is given
by \( v($t1) = $v0 - 1.66($t1) = $m1 \).
$PAR
The arrow will hit the moon when its height is 0 m.  That is, when 
\( s(t) = $v0 t - 0.83 t^2 = 0 \).  Solving by factoring gives 
\( ($v0-0.83 t)t = 0 \).  This gives two solutions: \( t = 0 \) 
and \( $v0-0.83 t = 0 \).  The solution \( t = 0 \) says that the height 
of the arrow is 0 m at time 0.  That is, the arrow is at height 0 at the 
moment the arrow is first shot. We are only interested in when the arrow 
actually returns to height 0, so the answer we want is 
\( $v0 - 0.83t = 0 \), or \( t = !{$t2:%6.4f} \).
$PAR
Finally, to find the velocity with which the arrow will hit the moon,
we use the two solutions above.  From the first question we know that
the velocity of the arrow at time \( t \) is given by \( v(t) \).  From
the second question, we know that the arrow hits the moon
at time \( t= !{$t2:%6.4f} \).  So the velocity of the arrow at that time
is \( v(!{$t2:%6.4f}) = $v0 - 1.66(!{$t2:%6.4f}) = !{$m2:%6.4f} \).  
Note that the negative velocity means that the arrow is moving downward.
