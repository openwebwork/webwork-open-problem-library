SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
It is necessary to recall the relationship between position
(distance) and speed (velocity).  Velocity is a change in position.
So the instantaneous velocity at time \( t \), call it \( v(t) \),  is given
by the change in position at time \( t \), call this \( p(t) \).  But the
change in position at time \( t \) is just the slope of the tangent
line to the graph of the position function at the  point (t,p(t)),
which is \( p'(t) \), the derivative of \( p \) evaluated at \(t 
\).              
$PAR 
However, this method only works when finding instantaneous velocities.  To 
find the average velocity over the interval \( [$t1 , $t2] \), we must
instead determine how far the particle traveled during that time 
interval and then divide by the number of seconds it traveled, using the 
simple relationship:  distance = rate \( \times \) time.  The particle 
traveled a distance  of \( s($t2) - s($t1) =  $a1($t2)^3 -$a1($t1)^3 = 
$a1($d2-$d1) = $d3 \) m.  Dividing this by the time spent traveling, 
which is \( $t2 - $t1 = $dt1 \) s, we get \($d3/$dt1 = $m1\) m/s.
$PAR
The instantaneous velocity at time $t1 is found by taking the 
derivative of \( s(t) \) and plugging in $t1.  That is, using the
rules for finding the derivative of a polynomial, \( v(t) = s'(t) = 
3($a1 t^2) \) so that \(v($t1) = 3($a1($t1)^2) = $m2 \) m/s.
