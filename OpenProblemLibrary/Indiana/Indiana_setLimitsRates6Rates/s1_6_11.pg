If a rock is thrown into the air on small planet with a velocity of \( $v0 \) m/s,
its height (in meters) after \( t \) seconds is given by
\( y = $v0 t - 4.9 t^2 \).  Find the velocity of the rock when
\( t = $t1 \). $BR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
It is necessary to recall the relationship between position 
(distance) and speed (velocity).  Velocity is a change in position.  
So the instantaneous velocity at time \( t \), call it \( v(t) \),  is given 
by the change in position at time \( t \), call this \( p(t) \).  But the
change in position at time \( t \) is just the slope of the tangent 
line to the graph of the position function at the  point (t,p(t)),
which is \( p'(t) \), the derivative of \( p \) evaluated at \(t \).
$PAR
In this case, we have a formula for position, \( y = $v0 t - 4.9 t^2 \).
Thus, instantaneous velocity at time \( t = $t1 \) is given
by finding \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) and evaluating at \( $t1 \).  Using the 
rules for differentiating a polynomial, \( \frac{dy}{dt} = $v0 - 2(4.9 t) \).
Plugging in \( t = $t1 \) shows that the velocity at this point in time
is \( $v0 - 9.8($t1) = !{$ans:%5.4f} \).
