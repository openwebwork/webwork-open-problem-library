The slope of  the tangent line to the parabola \( y = $f \)
at the point where \(  x = $x1   \) is:

$BR$BR

slope = \{ans_rule(20) \}

$BR$BR

The equation of this tangent line can be written in the form \( y = mx+b \)
where

$BR$BR

\(m = \) \{ans_rule(20)  \}

$BR$BR

and  where

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
The slope of the tangent line to a function \( f(x) \) at a point \( (x,y) \)
is given by the derivative of \( f \) at \( x \).  Thus, the first step is to 
find the derivative of \( f(x) = $a1 x^2 - $b1 x + $c1  \).  Using the rules 
for finding the derivatives of polynomials, we get \( f'(x) = 2($a1 x) - $b1 \).
Therefore, \( f'($x1) = $m1 \).
$PAR

Now, to find the equation of the tangent line, note that being tangent to 
\( f(x) \) at the point \( ($x1, f($x1)) = ($x1, $y1) \) means that the 
line goes through this point.  We already know that the slope of the 
line is \( $m1 \).  So using the point-slope form of a line yields 
\( (y-$y1) = $m1(x-$x1) \) or \( y = $m1 x + $ans \).
