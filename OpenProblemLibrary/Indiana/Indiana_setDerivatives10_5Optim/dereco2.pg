SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$SOL $PAR

Part (a) $BR
To calculate the cost at the production level $d1, we need only plug $d1
into the cost function \( C(x) \) to calculate \( C($d1) = $a2+{$b1}($d1) 
+ ($d1)^2 = !{$cost:%5.4f} \).
$PAR $HR $PAR

Part (b) $BR 
The average cost at the production level $d1 is the average cost of
producing each unit.  In part (a) we saw that the total cost was
\( !{$cost:%5.4f}, \) and we know that we are producing $d1 units.  Hence, the 
average cost per unit is \(\frac{!{$cost:%5.4f}}{$d1} = !{$acost:%5.4f} \)
$PAR $HR $PAR

Part (c) $BR
The marginal cost function is the derivative of the cost function.  Hence,
we differentiate the cost function \( C(x) \) and get \( C'(x) =
$b1 + 2x \).  Finally, to to determine the marginal cost at production 
level $d1, we plug $d1 into \( C'(x) \) and get \( C'($d1) = $b1+2($d1) 
!{$mcost:%5.4f} \).
$PAR $HR $PAR


Part (d) $BR
From part (b), the average cost function is \( A(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x} \) where
\( x \) is the production level.  To minimize this, we find the derivative
and solve for zero.  Simplifying, we have \( A(x) = \frac{$a2+{$b1}x+x^2}{x} \).
Hence, the derivative is \( A'(x) = \frac{x^2- $a2}{x^2}. \) Solving for zero, we get:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    A'(x) &= 0 \\ \\
    \frac{x^2-$a2}{x} &= 0 \\ \\
    x^2-$a2 &= 0 \\ \\
    x^2 &= $a2 \\ \\
    x &= \pm \sqrt{$a2} 
  \end{aligned}
\]
Checking reveals that \( \sqrt{$a2} = !{$mp:%5.4f} \) is indeed a minimum.
$PAR $HR $PAR

Part (e) $BR
Finally, the minimal average cost is found by plugging the value for \( x \)
which we just found into the average cost function \( A(x) \).  This yields
\( A(!{$mp:%5.4f}) = \frac{$a2 +$b1 (!{$mp:%5.4f}) +(!{$mp:%5.4f})^2}{!{$mp:%5.4f}} =
!{$acostmp:%5.4f} \).
