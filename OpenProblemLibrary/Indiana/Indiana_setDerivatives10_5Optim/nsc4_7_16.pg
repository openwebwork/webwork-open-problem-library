BEGIN_TEXT
The manager of a large apartment complex knows from experience that $max_rooms units
will be occupied if the rent is $min_rent dollars per month. A market survey suggests that,
on the average, one additional unit will remain vacant for each $demand_rate dollar increase
in rent.  Similarly, one additional unit will be occupied for each $demand_rate dollar
decrease in rent.  What rent should the manager charge to maximize
revenue?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$SOL $BR
As with most optimization problems, our goal is to write a formula for the
value we are trying to optimize in terms of the value which can be changed.
In this case, we need a formula for the revenue in terms of the amount of rent
charged.  First, note that the total revenue will be the number of rooms 
rented, which we will call \( R \), times the amount of rent charged per
room, which we will designate as \( x \).
$PAR
Note that we can write \( R \) in terms of \( x \) using the information 
from the problem.  From the information in the problem, it is clear that
the relationship between \( R \) and \( x \) is linear.  One point on the line
is given by \( ($max_rooms,$min_rent) \) as we are told that $max_rooms will
be occupied if the rent is $min_rent.  Another point on the line is
\( ($max_rooms-1,$min_rent+$demand_rate) \) since one additional unit will be
vacant for each $demand_rate dollar increase.  Thus, using these two points,
we can develope the equation for this line, \( R = \frac{-1}{$demand_rate}x 
+\{$min_rent/$demand_rate + $max_rooms\} \).
$PAR
From this information, we now have a formula for revenue.  Namely, 
\( f(x) = R \times x = \frac{-1}{$demand_rate}x^2 +
\{$min_rent/$demand_rate + $max_rooms\}x \).  This is the function we
wish to maximize, so we find its derivative and solve for zero.  The
derivative is given by \( f'(x) = \frac{-2}{$demand_rate}x +
\{$min_rent/$demand_rate + $max_rooms\} \). Solving for zero
yields:
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    f'(x) &= 0 \\ \\
    \frac{-2}{$demand_rate}x + \{$min_rent/$demand_rate + $max_rooms\} &= 0 \\ \\
    \frac{-2}{$demand_rate}x &= -\{$min_rent/$demand_rate + $max_rooms\} \\ \\
    x &= \frac{\{$min_rent/$demand_rate + $max_rooms\}($demand_rate)}{2} \\ \\
    x &= \frac{\{($min_rent/$demand_rate+$max_rooms)*$demand_rate\}}{2} \\ \\
    x &= $optimum_rent
  \end{aligned}
\]
Therefore, the maximum revenue occurs when we rent the units for $optimum_rent
dollars each.
