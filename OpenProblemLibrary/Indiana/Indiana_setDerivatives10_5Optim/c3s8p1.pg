SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
In order to solve this problem, we will need to write an expression
for the distance between this point and a point on our line.  Then, we
will need to find the point on the line which minimizes this distance.
$PAR
Note that as the equation for the line is give by \( !{$a}x + !{$b}y + 
$c = 0 \), any point on the line will have the form:

\[
  \left( x, \frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b} \right)
\]

So, the initial formula we will use to find the distance between such
a point and the fixed point \( ( $d, $e ) \) is just the distance formula
for these two points.  Namely:

\[
   f(x) = \sqrt{ ($d-x)^2 + \left($e-\frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right) ^2 }
\]

To make things easier on ourselves, we note that when we minimize the
distance, we also minimize the square of the distance.  So we will
actually work with a function \( g(x) \) defined by:

\[
  g(x) = ($d-x)^2 + \left($e-\frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right) ^2
\]

Now, we wish to minimize \( g(x) \), so we will find its 
derivative and solve for 0.  This will give us the \(x\) value
of the point on the line closest to our fixed point.  The reason
that we work with \( g(x) \)--the square of the distance--instead
of the actual distance \( f(x) \) is that it is now
relatively easy to find the derivative.

\[
  g'(x) = 2($d-x)(-1) + 2\left($e - \frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right)\left(\frac{$a}{$b}\right)
\]

Now, setting this equal to 0 we get:

\[
  \begin{aligned}
    g'(x) & = -2($d-x) + \frac{2($a)}{$b}\left($e - \frac{-!{$a}x-$c}{$b}\right) \\
      0   & = \{ -2*$d \} + 2x + \frac{ \{ 2*$a*$e \}}{$b} +
              \frac{ \{2*$a*$a\}x}{ \{$b**2\} } +
              \frac{ \{2*$a*$c\}}{ \{$b**2\} } \\
    -2x-\frac{ \{2*$a**2\}x}{ \{$b**2\} } &= 
              \frac{ \{-2*$d*$b**2\} + \{2*$a*$e*$b\} +
                     \{2*$a*$c\}}{ \{$b**2\} } \\
    x\left(\frac{ \{$b**2\} + \{$a**2\} }{ \{$b**2\}}\right) &=
              \frac{ -\{$a*$e*$b - $d*$b**2 + $a*$c\} }{ \{$b**2\} } \\
    x &= \frac{ -\{$a*$e*$b - $d*$b**2 + $a*$c\} }{ \{ $b**2 + $a**2 \} }
       = !{\{$d-$t*$a\}:%5.4f}
  \end{aligned}
\]

Now this is the \( x \) value at which the distance is at either
a maximum or a minimum.  However, it should be clear that
the distance is never at a maximum (just keep moving further
along the line), so this must be a minimum.  Then, it is a 
simple matter to plug this \( x \) value into the equation of 
the line to get the point:

\[ \big(!{\{$d-$t*$a\}:%5.4f}, !{\{$e-$t*$b\}:%5.4f}\big) \]

Which is the solution.
