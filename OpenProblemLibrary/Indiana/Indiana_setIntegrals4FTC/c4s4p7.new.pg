The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part I, can be found on p.392 of your
textbook.  It says that if
\[ g(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt \]
then the derivative of \(g(x)\) with respect to \(x\), written
\(\frac{d}{dx} g(x)\) or \(g'(x)\), is equal to \(f(x)\).  $PAR

Local extrema of \(f\) occur when \(f'(x)=0\).  So let's calculate \(f'(x)\)
and set it equal to zero to find the local extrema. $PAR

Applying the information above from the Fundamental Theorem to this
particular circumstance, we find
\[
\begin{aligned}
f'(t)	&= \frac{d}{dt} \left( \int_0^t
		\frac{x^2+$ab x+$ab1}{1+\cos^2(x)} dx \right)	\\\\
	&= \frac{x^2+$ab x+$ab1}{1+\cos^2(x)}
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR

This expression will be zero when its numerator is zero, and its denominator
will not offer us any peculiarities, because it can never be zero
(\(\cos^2(t) \geq 0\), so \(1+\cos^2(t) \geq 1 > 0\)). $PAR

Solving \(t^2+$ab t+$ab1 = 0\) simply amounts to factoring it into
\((t+$a)(t+$b)=0\) and arriving at the solutions \(t=-$a\) and \(t=-$b\). $PAR

Now, to see if these are maxima or minima, we must compute the second
derivative of \(f\), and evaluate it at \(-$a\) and \(-$b\).  The second
derivative of \(f\) can be computed by the quotient rule, as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}f(t)
&=	\frac{d}{dt}f'(t)	\\\\
&=	\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{t^2+$ab t+$ab1}{1+\cos^2(t)}\right)	\\\\
&=	\frac{(1+\cos^2(t))(2t+$ab)-(t^2+$ab t+$ab1)(1-2\cos(t)\sin(t))}
		{(1+\cos^2(t))^2}
\end{aligned}
\]
We shall not bother to simplify this further, because it suits our purposes
already.  Note that we can completely ignore the denominator, because we're
only worried about whether \(f''(x)\) is positive or negative when at
\(x=-$a\) and \(x=-$b\), and the denominator is always positive. $PAR

Plugging in \(-$a\) for \(x\) in the expression
\((1+\cos^2(t))(2t+$ab)-(t^2+$ab t+$ab1)(1-2\cos(t)\sin(t))\)
gives \((1+\cos^2(-$a))($soln_bma)-0\) because
\($a^2+$ab \cdot $a+$ab1 = 0\).  Since both these numbers are positive, the
second derivative of \(f\) evaluated at \(-$a\) is positive, making \(-$a\) 
a local minimum.$PAR

Plugging in \(-$b\) for \(x\) in the expression
\((1+\cos^2(t))(2t+$ab)-(t^2+$ab t+$ab1)(1-2\cos(t)\sin(t))\)
gives \((1+\cos^2(-$b))($soln_amb)-0\) because
\($b^2+$ab \cdot $b+$ab1 = 0\).  Since one of these numbers is positive and
the other negative, the second derivative of \(f\) evaluated at \(-$b\) is
negative, making \(-$b\) a local maximum.$PAR

Thus, \(-$b\) is the maximum we sought.
