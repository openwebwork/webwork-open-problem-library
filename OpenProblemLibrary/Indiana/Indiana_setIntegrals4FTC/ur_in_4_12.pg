&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$SOL $BR
As the problem statement suggests, the best method to use in solving
this problem is to graph the function \( f(x) \).  Then, we can use the
fact that the integration of a curve on the interval [a,b] can be 
interpreted as the area underneath that curve between the lines \(x=a\)
and \(x=b\).
$PAR

The graph of \( f(x) \) is shown below (Click on it to enlarge).
$PAR

$my_txt
$PAR $BR

(a) \( g($p0) \) will be the area under the graph of \( f(x) \) for
  \( $p0 \leq x \leq $p1 \).  As \( f \) is always 0 on that
  interval in the graph, the area underneath it is clearly
  0, making \( g($p0) = 0 \).
$PAR $BR

(b) In this case, we want the area underneath the graph of \( f(x) \)
  on the interval \( $p1 \leq x \leq $p2 \).  On this interval, \( f \)
  is always $a.  Therefore, the value of \( g($p0) \) is
  \{ ($p2-$p1)*$a \}.
$PAR $BR

(c) To compute \( g($p4) \), note that \( f \) takes on two different
  values on the interval [$p1,$p4].  Between $p1 and $p3, \(f\) has the
  value $a.  Between $p3 and $p4, \( f \) has the value $b.  Therefore,
  the value of \( g($p4) \) is \( $a($p3-$p1) + $b($p4-$p3) = $ans3 \).
$PAR $BR

(d) In computing \( g($p6) \), we note that again, \( f \) takes on
  different values on the interval [$p1,$p6].  Between $p1 and $p3, the
  value is $a.  Between $p3 and $p4 the value is $b.  Finally, between
  $p4 and $p6, the value is 0.  Hence, the value of
  \( g($p6) \) is \( $a($p3-$p1) + $b($p5-$p3) + 0($p6-$p5) = $ans4 \).
$PAR $BR

(e) The maximum value of \( g \) occurs at the \( x \) for which
  \( f \) has the largest area between $p1 and \( x \).  Note
  that between $p3 and $p5, \( f \) actually has a negative
  value, which would take away from the value of \( g \).  Therefore,
  the maximum value will take place at $p3.  That value will be
  the total area underneath the graph between $p1 and $p3, 
  which is $ans6.
