Given
\[ f(x) = \int_0^x \frac{ t^2 - $asquared }{ 1+\cos^2(t)} dt \]
At what value of \( x\) does the local max of \( f(x) \) occur?
$PAR
\( x = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}

&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$SOL $BR
First, note that we don't need to do any computation to compute the
first derivative, which we will use to check for local 
maxima and minima.  By applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we
see that:
\[
  f'(x) = \frac{x^2 - $asquared}{1+\cos^2(x)} 
\]
Now, we can use this derivative to find the critical points of
the function.  We set this to zero and solve for 
\( x \) to get: \[
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{x^2 - $asquared}{1+\cos^2(x)} &= 0 \\ \\
    x^2 - $asquared &= 0 \\ \\
    (x+$a)(x-$a) &= 0 \\ \\
    x = $a \mbox{ or } x = -$a &
  \end{aligned}
\]
Checking on either side of these two points shows that -$a is the local
maximum for which we are looking.
