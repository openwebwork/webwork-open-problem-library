&SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));

Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we see that if we had 
\( \displaystyle \int_{10}^x t^3\ dt \), then we could say that \( f'(x) = x^3 \).  
Unfortunately, we don't have the integral from 10 to \( x \), but rather
from \( x \) to 10.  So, we will change things around a bit before we
can apply the theorem.  Recall that \( \displaystyle \int_a^b g(t)\ dt \) is the same
as \( \displaystyle -\int_b^a g(t)\ dt \).  Therefore, we see that
\[
  f(x) = \int_x^{10} t^3\ dt = -\int_{10}^x t^3\ dt
\]
and hence, applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, 
\[
  f'(x) = -x^3
\]
