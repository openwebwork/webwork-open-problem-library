BEGIN_TEXT
A force of \($A\) pounds is required to hold a spring stretched
$b feet beyond its natural length. How much work (in foot-pounds)
is done in stretching the spring from its natural length to $c feet
beyond its natural length?

$SOL $BR $BR

Because the force required to stretch a spring to a certain length increases
linearly with that length, we know the function that converts stretch length
to required force will be of the form \(F(l)=a \cdot l+b\),
for constants \(a\) and \(b\).
But since 0 pounds are required to not stretch the spring at all, the
\(b\) constant is 0.  And since $A $soln_A_is_are required to stretch
the spring $b feet, \(F($b)=C \cdot $b=$A\), making \(C=$soln_C\).
$BR $BR

Now that we know the force required to stretch the spring to a given length,
we can integrate that force from 0 to $c to calculate the accumulation of all
the force required to do that much stretching:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^{$c} F(x) \; dx
&=	\int_0^{$c} $soln_C x \; dx	\\\\
&=	\left \frac{$soln_C x^2}{2} \right|_0^{$c}	\\\\
&=	\frac{$soln_C \cdot $c^2}{2} - \frac{$soln_C \cdot 0^2}{2}	\\\\
&=	$answer
\end{aligned}
\]
