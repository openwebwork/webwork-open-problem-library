$SOL $BR $BR

In this problem, we really get to learn the intuition behind the symbols in
the integral.  Stewart stresses that one can consider the differential \(dx\) 
to be a very small slice of the dimension of the integration.  We can see in
this problem how that is true. $BR $BR

We consider the cone to be of height $A, filled up to point $C with hot
chocolate.  So let's assume the cone rests on the origin in 3-space, and we
then must integrate from 0 to $C along the \(z\)-axis, and the expression we're
integrating should be the force required to lift that infinitessimally slim
cylinder of hot chocolate out of the tank. $BR $BR

When \(z=0\), at the base of the cone, the radius is 0 (the cone's vertex).  When z=$A, at the
top of the cone, the radius is $b.  We wish the radius to
increase linearly from 0 to $b as we \(z\) changes from 0 to $A, because that's how cones
are shaped, so the radius at any point \(z \in \left[0,$A\right]\) will be
\(\frac{$b}{$A} z \).  And thus the area of a circular
cross-section of the cone (parallel to the xy-plane) is
\(\pi\left(\frac{$b}{$A} z\right) ^2\).
And thus the volume of the corresponding infinitessimally
thin cylinder of hot chocolate is
\(\pi\left(\frac{$b}{$A} z \right)^2 dz\). $BR $BR

We need to know the work required to bring one of these infinitessimally slim
cylinders up and out of the tank, and then we can simply integrate that
expression over the whole mass of hot chocolate to get our final answer.
So we recall \(work = force \cdot distance\), but we haven't been given a
force.  So we recall \(force = mass \cdot acceleration\), but we haven't been
given a mass either.  So we recall \(mass = volume \cdot density\),
and we have been given both of these.
Thus into the expression
\(work = volume \cdot density \cdot acceleration \cdot distance\) 
we plug the following values: $BR
 -> \(\pi\left(\frac{$b}{$A} z \right)^2  dz\) for volume, $BR
 -> \(\delta\) (i.e., \($D kg/m^3\)) for density, $BR
 -> the acceleration due to gravity (\(g\), \(9.8 m/s^2\)) for acceleration
	(because the work being done is against gravity), and $BR
 -> \($A-z\) for distance, because that's the distance from the
	infinitessimally thin cylinder of hot chocoalate to the top of the cone
	(i.e., the distance it must be moved).
$BR $BR

And now we integrate work over the whole mass of hot chocolate:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^{$C} $D \cdot 9.8 ($A-z)
	\pi\left(\frac{$b}{$A} z \right)^2  dz
&=	\pi $D \cdot 9.8 \cdot \frac{$b^2}{$A^2}
		\int_0^{$C} \left($A z^2 - z^3\right)  dz	\\\\
&=	$soln_interm \left( \left. \left( \frac{$A z^3}{3} - \frac{z^4}{4} \right)
		\right|_0^{$C} \right)	\\\\
&=	$soln_interm \left( \frac{$A ($C)^3}{3}- \frac{$C ^4}{4} \right)	\\\\
&=	$soln_final	
\end{aligned}
\]
