$SOL  $BR  $BR

We are asked for the $m$endstr derivative of \(f\) evaluated at 0, or
\(f^{($m)}(0)\).  Since we know the MacLaurin/Taylor series contain such
derivatives, and we know the MacLaurin/Taylor series for \(\arctan(x)\) 
from looking in the textbook, we should be able to find inside it the
desired derivative.  $BR  $BR

First note that the series we seek can be found on p.758 of Stewart:
\[	\arctan(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}	\]
$BR $BR

Since this is true of all \(x\), we can apply it in our case specifically
to note that
\[	\arctan\left(\frac{x^{$b}}{$a}\right)
	=	\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n
		\frac{\left(\frac{x^{$b}}{$a}\right)^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
	=	\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n
		\frac{x^{$soln_2b n + $b}}{(2n+1)$a^{2n+1}}	\]
$BR $BR

Now we know that the coefficients \(c_m\) in a Taylor series are of the form
\( \frac{f^{(m)}(0)}{m!} \), for all \(m\).  Therefore in particular, for
our series, it must be true that \(c_{$soln_2b n + $b} =
\frac{f^{($soln_2b n + $b)}(0)}{($soln_2b n + $b)!} \).  So we look at the
expansion above and see that the coefficient for the \(x^{$soln_2b n + $b}\)
term, \(c_{$soln_2b n + $b}\), is equal to \(\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)$a^{2n+1}}\).
So we know know that \(c_{$soln_2b n + $b}\) is equal to two different things,
one because of the expansion we know above from the Taylor series for
\(\arctan(x)\), and one because of the general notion of Taylor series we
just discussed in this paragraph.  So we set those two things equal:
\[	\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)$a^{2n+1}}
	=	\frac{f^{($soln_2b n + $b)}(0)}{($soln_2b n + $b)!}	\]
and this leads to finding a formula for any derivative that shows up as a
coefficient in the series:
\[	f^{($soln_2b n + $b)}(0)
	=	\frac{(-1)^n($soln_2b n + $b)!}{(2n+1)$a^{2n+1}}	\]
$BR $BR

Since we are looking for \(f^{($m)}(0)\), we must find \(n\) for which
\($soln_2b n + $b = $m\), but this is simple algebra: \(n = $p\).  So we
find our answer as follows:
\[	f^{($m)}(0)
	=	f^{($soln_2b \cdot $p + $b)}(0)
	=	\frac{(-1)^{$p} $m!}{(2 \cdot $p + 1)$a^{2 \cdot $p + 1}}
	=	$ans	\]
