We have been instructed to find the seventh degree Taylor polynomial for
\(F(x)\), which involves taking a lot of derivatives, and if at first you
begin to do this by hand, you soon discover that you use many sheets of
paper.  Although it is certainly possible to do very carefully by hand,
it might be in your best interest to use a computer algebra system like
Mathematica to handle such work for you.  Below, I only give the formulas
for each derivative, not all the work of expanding and simplifying that
leads up to them, since one only needs to know how to differentiate \(\sin(x)\)
and \(\cos(x)\) and use the product rule for differentiation to compute all
the derivatives below, however patience and attention to detail couldn't hurt.

\[
\begin{aligned}
F(x)		&=	\int_0^x \sin($c t^2) dt	\\\\
F'(x)		&=	\sin($c x^2)	\\\\
			&	\text{by box \#5, p.393, a rewriting of part 1
					of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}	\\\\
F''(x)		&=	2 \cdot $c x \cos($c x^2)	\\\\
F^{(3)}(x)	&=	-4 \cdot $c^2 x^2 \sin($c x^2) + 2 \cdot $c \cos($c x^2) \\\\
F^{(4)}(x)	&=	-8 \cdot $c^3 x^3 \cos($c x^2)
					- 12 \cdot $c^2 x \sin($c x^2) \\\\
F^{(5)}(x)	&=	16 \cdot $c^4 x^4 \sin($c x^2)
					- 48 \cdot $c^3 x^2 \cos($c x^2)
					- 12 \cdot $c^2 \sin($c x^2)	\\\\
F^{(6)}(x)	&=	32 \cdot $c^5 x^5 \cos($c x^2)
					+ 160 \cdot $c^4 x^3 \sin($c x^2)
					- 120 \cdot $c^3 x \cos($c x^2)	\\\\
F^{(7)}(x)	&=	- 64 \cdot $c^6 x^6 \sin($c x^2)
					+ 480 \cdot $c^5 x^4 \cos($c x^2)
					+ 720 \cdot $c^4 x^2 \sin($c x^2)
					- 120 \cdot $c^3 \cos($c x^2)
\end{aligned}

We evaluate each of these at 0 to obtain values to place into the Taylor
polynomial; again, the work is ommitted in most because it's just calculator
use:
\[
\begin{aligned}
F(0)		&=	\int_0^0 \sin($c t^2) dt = 0	\\\\
			&	\text{(an empty integral)}	\\\\
F'(0)		&=	0	\\\\
F''(0)		&=	0	\\\\
F^{(3)}(0)	&=	2 \cdot $c = $soln_2c	\\\\
F^{(4)}(0)	&=	0	\\\\
F^{(5)}(0)	&=	0	\\\\
F^{(6)}(0)	&=	0	\\\\
F^{(7)}(0)	&=	-120 \cdot $c^3 = -$soln_120c3
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR $BR

Now we can build the polynomial in question:
\[
\begin{aligned}
T_7(x)	&=	\frac{0x^0}{0!} + \frac{0x^1}{1!} + \frac{0x^2}{2!}
			+ \frac{$soln_2c x^3}{3!} + \frac{0x^4}{4!} + \frac{0x^5}{5!}
			+ \frac{0x^6}{6!} + \frac{-$soln_120c3 x^7}{7!}	\\\\
		&=	0+0+0 + \frac{$c}{3}x^3 + 0+0+0 - \frac{$soln_c3}{42}x^7	\\\\
		&=	$soln_cd3 x^3 - $soln_c3d42 x^7
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR $BR

To use this polynomial to approximate \( \displaystyle \int_0^{$a} \sin($c x^2) dx \),
we simply note that this is equal to \( \displaystyle \int_0^x \sin($c t^2) dt \) with
\(x = $a\), and thus it is equal to \(F($a)\).  Since \(T_7(x)\) is an
approximation of \(F(x)\), we can evaluate \(T_7($a)\) to approximate
\(F($a)\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
T_7($a)	&=	$soln_cd3 ($a)^3 - $soln_c3d42 ($a)^7	\\\\
		&=	$soln_cd3 \cdot $soln_a3 - $soln_c3d42 \cdot $soln_a7	\\\\
		&=	$soln_coef1a3 - $soln_coef2a7 = $soln2
\end{aligned}
\]
