We must simply calculate the first few derivatives of \(f(x)\) and evaluate
them at 0 to solve this problem.  The calculations of the derivatives are
not shown step-by-step here, because they all simply use the rule
\(\frac{d}{dx}\left(u^n\right) = n\cdot u^{n-1}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}\),
with which you are undoubtedly familiar, inasmuch as you are studying
something as far along as Taylor series.  $BR  $BR
\[
\begin{aligned}
	f(x)	&=	\left( $b x + $c \right)^{$m/$n}	\\\\
	f'(x)	&=	\frac{$soln_bm}{$n} \left( $b x + $c \right)^{1/$n}	\\\\
	f''(x)	&=	\frac{$soln_b2m}{$soln_n2}
					\left( $b x + $c \right)^{$soln_1mn/$n}	\\\\
	f'''(x)	&=	\frac{$soln_b3_m_1mn}{$soln_n3}
					\left( $b x + $c \right)^{$soln_1m2n/$n}
\end{aligned}
\]

Each of these can be evaluated at \($a\), using a calculator, and the results
will be as follows (again, no work shown because no surprises arise):
\[
\begin{aligned}
	f($a)		&=	$coeff0	\\\\
	f'($a) 		&=	$coeff1	\\\\
	f''($a) 	&=	$coeff2	\\\\
	f'''($a)	&=	$coeff3
\end{aligned}
\]
And thus the Taylor polynomial becomes:
\[
\begin{aligned}
T_3(x)	&=	\frac{c_0 x^0}{0!} + \frac{c_1 x^1}{1!} + \frac{c_2 x^2}{2!}
			+ \frac{c_3 x^3}{3!} + \cdots	\\\\
		&=	$coeff0 + $coeff1 x + \frac{$coeff2}{2} c^2
			+ \frac{$coeff3}{6} x^3 + \cdots	\\\\
		&=	$coeff0 + $coeff1 x + $soln_c_2 x^2 + $soln_c_3 x^3
\end{aligned}
\]
