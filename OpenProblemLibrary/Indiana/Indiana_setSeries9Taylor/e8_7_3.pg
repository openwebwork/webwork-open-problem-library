This simply involves calculating the derivatives of \(\arctan($a x)\) and
evaluating them at 0 to find the coefficients for the series.  I recommend
using an automatic differentiator like Maple for such a process, because
repeated derivatives of this function get to be large complicated expressions,
and although it is certainly possible to do by hand, it is much faster and
more reliable by computer (and can be educational to familiarize yourself with
such resources, if you have not before, of course).  So the needed derivatives
of \(f(x)\) are given below, so you can check your work, but the calculation
of those derivatives is merely repeated use of the quotient rule for
differentiation, and so it fairly mechanical and uninteresting.
\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x)		&=	\arctan($a x)	\\\\
f'(x)		&=	\frac{$a}{1+$soln_a2 x^2}	\\\\
f''(x)		&=	\frac{-$soln_2a3 x}{(1+$soln_a2 x^2)^2}	\\\\
f^{(3)}(x)	&=	\frac{$soln_8a5 x^2}{(1+$soln_a2 x^2)^3}
					- \frac{$soln_2a3}{(1+$soln_a2 x^2)^2}	\\\\
f^{(4)}(x)	&=	\frac{-$soln_48a7 x^3}{(1+$soln_a2 x^2)^4}
					+ \frac{$soln_24a5 x}{(1+$soln_a2 x^2)^3}
\end{aligned}
\]

And we can simply evaluate each of these derivatives at 0 to find the
numerators for the coefficients in our power series.  Again, the work is not
shown because it's just calculator use.
\[
\begin{aligned}
f(0)		&=	0	\\\\
f'(0)		&=	$a	\\\\
f''(0)		&=	0	\\\\
f^{(3)}(x)	&=	-$soln_2a3	\\\\
f^{(4)}(x)	&=	0
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR $BR

So now we can piece together the power series:
\[
\begin{aligned}
T_4(x)	&=	\frac{0 x^0}{0!} + \frac{$a x^1}{1!} + \frac{0 x^2}{2!}
			+ \frac{-$soln_2a3 x^3}{3!} + \frac{0 x^4}{4!}	\\\\
		&=	0 + $a x + 0 - $soln_a3d3 x^3 + 0	\\\\
		&=	$a x - $soln_a3d3 x^3
\end{aligned}
\]
