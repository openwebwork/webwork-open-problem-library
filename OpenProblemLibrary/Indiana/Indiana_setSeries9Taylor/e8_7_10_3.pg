Let \( T_{k}(x) \): be the taylor polynomial of degree k of the function
	\( f(x) = \sin(x) \) 
at \(a = 0 \). $BR

Suppose you approximate \( f(x) \) by \( T_{k}(x) \), and if \( |x| \leq 1 \), how many terms
do you need (that is, what is k) for you to have your error to be less than
\( \frac{1}{$f} \) ? 
(Hint: use the alternating series approximation.)

First recall that the Taylor series for \(\sin(x)\) is
\(\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}\). $BR $BR

Next note that this problem is interesting because the series
has been written more compactly than it is constructed.
That is, when computing the Taylor series for \(\sin(x)\), it comes out to be
\[	0 + x + 0 - \frac{x^3}{3!} + 0
	+ \frac{x^5}{5!} + 0 - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots	\]
So for example the sixth term would be \(\frac{x^5}{5!}\).
But when we look at the formula we're given for the Taylor series for
\(\sin(x)\), we find the zero terms have been removed by the use of the
\(2n+1\) expression:
\[	\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
	=	x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots	\]
So for example the sixth term would be \(\frac{x^9}{9!}\), different than
it was in the first series.  Since we are asked for a specific number term of
the Taylor series, it's important to get this numbering right!$BR $BR

So when they ask for the value of \(k\) in the question above, we may 
use the compact series \(\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}\) 
to get our answer, but that value of \(k\) will refer to the term that has
\(x^{2k+1}\) in it.  So it will actually be the \(2k+1\)st term of the true
Taylor expansion of \(\sin(x)\).  Thus we will solve the problem using the
compact Taylor expansion for \(\sin(x)\), but then we must multiply our
answer by two and add one.  $BR $BR

By the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem on p.729 (which this problem
suggested we use), we know that the error involved in estimating with \(k\) 
terms is \(R_k\), and it satisfies the following inequality:
\[	\left|R_k\right| = \left|s-s_k\right| \leq b_{k+1}	\]
where \(b_k\) is the absolute values of the \(k\)th term of the series.  So
applying this to our case, we find we need \(\left|R_k\right|\) to be less than
\(\frac 1 {$f}\), so we seek a term \(b_{k+1}\) that is less than
\(\frac 1 {$f}\), thereby showing that \(\left|R_k\right|\) is also less than
\(\frac 1 {$f}\).  In our sequence,
\[	b_{k+1} = \frac{x^{2(k+1)+1}}{(2(k+1)+1)!} = \frac{x^{2k+3}}{(2k+3)!}	\]
We find that because they told us \(\left|x\right| \leq 1\), we can ensure
\(\frac{x^{2k+3}}{(2k+3)!}\) will be smaller than \(\frac 1 {$f}\) simply by
ensuring \(\frac 1 {(2k+3)!}\) is smaller than \(\frac 1 {$f}\).  So we solve
for the smallest \(k\) making this true:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac 1 {(2k+3)!} \leq	\frac 1 {$f}
&\iff	(2k+3)! \geq $f	\\\\
&\iff	2k+3 \geq $b	\\\\
&\iff	2k \geq $soln_bm3	\\\\
&\iff	k \geq $soln_bm3d2
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR $BR

Now that we've found a value for \(k\) for the compacted version of the Taylor
series for \(\sin(x)\) (specifically, \(k = $soln_bm3d2\)), we recall that
this refers to the
\(x^{2k+1} = x^{2 \cdot $soln_bm3d2 + 1} = x^{$answer}\) 
term, so it is actually term \($answer\) of the real Taylor series for
\(\sin(x)\).
