BEGIN_TEXT
A palindrome is a number (like 535) that is the same if the digits are written
in reverse order.$BR
If a number is a three digit multiple of eleven then the probability that it 
is $BR a palindrome is \{ans_rule(3)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In this sort of problem a little bit of experimenting goes a long way so lets try.
A three digit multiple of 11 must be 11 times a 2 digit number (since \(11\times 9=99\) $BR and 99 is a 2 digit number).  So first lets find the largest 2 digit number$BR which, when multiplied by 11 gives a 3 digit number.  A few experiments will$BR show you that \90\times 11 =990\) while \(91\times 11 = 1001\). $PARNow we know that there are 81 three digit number starting with 110 and ending with 990$BR  that are multiples of 11. (The reason for the 81 is that these are 11 times each $BR of the numbers from 10 to 90.)
$PAR
Now we experiment a few times.  \(10\times 11=110\ \), \( 11\times 11 =121\ \), 
\(12\times 11=132\). $BR What have we learned do far?$BR
 When we increase the number we muliply by 1 the last digit if the product increases by 1.  $BR That means that for every first digit there cannot be more than one palindrome$BR and if we use all possible second digits there will be
exactly one palindrome$BR (since a 3 digit number is a palindrome when the third digit is the same as the first. $PAR
Now we know that we have a palindrome for the two digit numbers with first digit 1, 2, ..., 8.$BR  The only number with first digit 9 is 90 and \(90\times 11=990\) is not a palindrome. $BR Thus 8 of the 81  three digit multiples of 11 is a palindrome.
