BEGIN_TEXT
A book is opened to a page at random. 
 The product of the facing page numbers is $b  .
$BR  The sum of the facing page numbers is
\{ans_rule(2)\}

BEGIN_TEXT
   Hint: Open any book and look at the page numbers of the two pages
that you see$BR (they face one another).$BR  Do you see anything special
about the relationship between the two numbers?$BR  If not, try to open
to a different pair.  Do they always have the same sum? $BR Do they always
differ by the same number? $BR If you see something special can you see 
a way to use this to help solve the problem?
END_TEXT
};

ANS(Real($ans)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Two facing pages have consecutive number so you are looking for two consecutive
numbers $BR whose product is $b.  You can guess, or fully factor or solve a
$BR quadratic equation to find that the numbers are $a and $c and the answer is $ans.
