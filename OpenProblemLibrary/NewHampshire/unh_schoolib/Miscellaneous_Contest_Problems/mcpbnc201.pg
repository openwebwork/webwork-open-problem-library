BEGIN_TEXT

One square has a perimeter of 40 inches.  A second square has a perimeter of 
36 inches.
$PAR
The positive difference of the areas of the two squares is 
\{ans_rule(1)\} square inches.$PAR
\{Panic::Button(label => " Ask for a Hint", penalty => .00)\}

   Hint: When you know the perimeter of a square it is easy to find the length of$BR a side.  When you know the length of a side of a square it is easy to find
the area.

ANS(Real($ans)->cmp);

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The positive difference of two numbers is the result of subtracting the smaller
number from the larger number. $BR
The length of a side of a square is one quarter of the perimeter so the length
of a side of the first square$BR is 10 inches and so its area is 100 square inches.  $BR
Similarly, the length of a side of the second square is 9 inches and its area is81 square inches.$PAR
So the answer is \(100-81=19\)
