BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We can think of the numbers from 1 to $a as having two digits (where the first 
digit of the numbers from 1 to 9 is 0. $PAR
Each of the numbers from 1 to 9 appears as a second digit $c times (once following 0, once following 1, etc).$BR
Since the sum of the numbers from 1 to 9 is 45, the second digits sum to 
\(45*$c\).  $BR
Each number from 1 to $b occurs 10 times as a first digit.$BR
  The sum of the numbers from 1 to $b is $d.$BR
$PAR
So the sum of all of the digits of the number from 1 to $a is 10*$d+45*$c
 =$ans.
