BEGIN_TEXT
There are \{ans_rule(2)\} solutions of the equation \(x+y+z=20\) where \(x,\) \(y,\) and \(z\) are positive integers$PAR
Note that \(x=1,\) \(y=1,\) \(z=18\) and \(x=18,\) \(y=1,\) \(z=1\) are different solutions.$BR Also
\(0\) is not a positive integer.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
One way to attack the problem is to choose a value of \(z\) and see how many pairs \(x\) and \(y\) $BR can go with it.  For example, if \(z=1\) then \(x+y=19\) and so there are 18
$BR such \(x,\) \(y\)  pairs (since \(x\) can be anything from 1 to 18). $BR
If you look at this carefully, you see that if \(z\) is any number from 1 to 18 there
are $BR \(19-z\) pairs \(x,\) \(y\) that can go with it.  $PAR
This means our answer is \(1+2+...+18\).$BR  The trick to getting this sum is to
 write the equation forward $BR
\(S=1+2+...+18\) and then backward $BR
\(S=18+17+...+1\) and, adding the numbers in the same position obtain$BR
\(2S=19+19+...19\) so \(2S=18\times 19\) and so \(S=9 \times 19 =171\)
