   Hint: A healthy chicken has two legs and a healthy cow has four legs.  $BR
If all the animals in the group were chickens would there be more legs than $BR 
twice the number of animals?  Suppose there was one cow and the rest were
chickens, then how many more legs would there be than twice the number of animals?
$BR If you have figured this out, you should be able to answer the original question.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The people who made up the problem think that healthy chickens have 2 legs and
healthy cows $BR have four legs, and healthy animals have one head..  You can argue all you want about healthy$BR 3 legged , two headed cows,  but that won't get you  credit on the problem.
$BR Now assigning two of the legs to each animal, all remaining legs must belong to cows$BR (2 to each cow).  Thus the number of cows is \(\frac{$a5}{2}=$ans5\).
