BEGIN_TEXT
Jack, Carl, Max, and Sam are friends.  Jack had no money but the $BR others did. Carl gave Jack one fifth of his money, Max gave Jack$BR one fourth of his money, Sam gave Jack one third of his money.$BR  Each gave Jack the same amount of money. $PAR
Now Jack has \{ans_rule(3)\} of the group's money. $BR
Express your answer as a fraction.

END_TEXT
ANS(Fraction("1/4")->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Suppose we call the amount that each friend gave to Jack by the letter M.  $BR Since M is one fifth of his money, he must have started with 5M.$BR  Similarly, Max must have started with 4M and Sam with 3M.$BR  Thus the total money in the group was 12M of which Jack now has 3M.$BR So Jack has \(\frac{3}{12}=\frac{1}{4}\) of the group's money.
