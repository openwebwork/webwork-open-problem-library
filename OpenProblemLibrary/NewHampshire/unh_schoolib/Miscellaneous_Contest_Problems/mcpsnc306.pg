BEGIN_TEXT
The number of integers between 101 and 1000 that are perfect squares is 
\{ans_rule(1)\}.

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(21)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
We know that \(10^2=100\) so \(11^2\) is the smallest of these integers. $BR
To find the largest, we must find the largest number whose square is less than $BR or equal to 1000.  We know that \(30^2=900\) and so we try the next number.$BR
\(31^2 =30^2+2\times 30+1=961\).  So \(32^2\) is too large.  Thus the numbers whose$BR squares are between 101 and 1000 are 11...31 and there are 21 of them.
