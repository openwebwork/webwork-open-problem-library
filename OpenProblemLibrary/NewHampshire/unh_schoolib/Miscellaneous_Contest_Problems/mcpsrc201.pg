The smallest sum one could get by adding three different numbers from the set$BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The first thing that you should notice is that there are too many ways to pick$BR three different numbers out of a set of six numbers (actually 120)$BR for trial
and error so you have to think of an approach.  $PAR
But here the approach is easy. $BR The smallest sum comes from adding the smallest three numbers. $BR
Notice that for this purpose you should consider a negative number smaller than $BR a positive number.  If you are worried about that, just check that the negative $BR numbers in the list still contribute to a positive sum which is then smaller $BR than any other possible positive sum.
