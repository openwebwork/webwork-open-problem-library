BEGIN_TEXT
In an election, everyone votes for either candidate A or candidate B.$BR  After 60$PERCENT of the votes are counted, candidate A is leading 60% to 40$PERCENT. $BR
That means that B must get \{ans_rule(1)\}$PERCENT of the remaining vote$BR to have the same number of votes as A.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Suppose that the election has T voters.$BR
After 60% of the votes are counted, \(0.6\times T\) votes have been counted.$BR
A has 60% of these votes, that is \(0.6\times 0.6\times T =0.36\times T\) votes.$BR
B has 40% of these votes, that is \(0.4\times 0.6\times T =0.24\times T\) votes.$BR
Now of the \(0.4\times T\)  votes left to be counted, B has to get \(0.26\times T\) votes$BR in order to tie A. $BR
So we have to figure out what percentage of \(0.4\times T\) is \(0.26\times T\).$BR
\(\frac{0.26}{0.4}=0.65\), so B needs 65% of the remaining vote.
