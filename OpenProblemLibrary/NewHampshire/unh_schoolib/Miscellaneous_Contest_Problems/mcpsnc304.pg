BEGIN_TEXT
A baseball league consists of 4 teams, A, B, C, D.  Each team plays each other$BR team four times.  A wins \(\frac{1}{6}\) of its games, B wins 7 games and C wins half of its games.$PAR
That means that D wins \{ans_rule(1)\} games.

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(9)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Each team plays four games with each of the three other teams, a total of 12 games. $BR
A wins \(\frac{1}{6}\times 12 = 2\);$BR
C wins half of 12 games so it wins 6 games.$BR
B wins 7 games.$BR
Since each team plays 12 games, but it takes two teams to play a game,$BR the league plays 24 games.$PAR
So D wins \(24-2-6-7=9\) games.
