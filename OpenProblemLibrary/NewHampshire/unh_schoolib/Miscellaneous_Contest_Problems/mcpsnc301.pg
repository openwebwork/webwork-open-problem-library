BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In this sort of problem the first thing that you have to realize is that there
$BR is no way that you could write out the number  \(3^{9999}\).  A usual rule
$BR is that if a contest problem looks incredibly hard it is probably amazingly
$BR easy.$PAR
First note that \(3^1=3,\ 3^2=9,\ 3^3=27,\ 3^4=81,\ 3^5=243\).$BR
Now you should notice that when you multiply by 3 the last digit of the answer depends$BR only on the last digit of the other multiplicand.  Now you can see that the $BR last digits have to follow the pattern 3,9,7,1,3,9,7,1,..., that is 
every fourth term is 1.$BR Now \(9999=4\times 2499+3\).  This should be easy for you to see since \(10000\div 4=2500\). $BR 
So \(3^{9999}=3^{4\times 2499+3}=3^{4\times 2499}\times 3^3\).$BR
Now this means that we have gotten to 1 a total of 2499 times in the pattern and then took$BR
3 more steps.  So our answer is 7.
