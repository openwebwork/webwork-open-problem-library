$PAR

 In a sequence of five integers the third integer is the sum of the previous
two, $BR the fourth integer is the sum of the previous three and the fifth integer is the sum of the previous four.  If the sum of the five integers is $sum4 then the third integer is \{ans_rule(2)\}.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
If you let A and B be your first two integers the third will be A+B,$BR
the fourth will be 2(A+B) and the fifth will be 4(A+B) so the sum will
be 8(A+B)$BR Thus \(8(A+B)=$sum4\) and \(A+B=$c4\).$BR  Since A+B is the 
third number, the answer is $c4.
