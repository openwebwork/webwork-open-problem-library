BEGIN_TEXT
Although this is called a problem it is really an explanation of $BR
how you will answer questions in the WeBWorK system which you will be
using for some of your homework.
$PAR
A question will often look something like this:
$PAR
1+1=\{ ans_rule(1) \}
$PAR
The little box to the right of the \(\ = \ \) sign is called an answer box.$BR
When you see a problem like this, you should type the answer to the
$BR
question into the number box. Do that now.
$PAR
Now you can see if your answer is correct by clicking on the box that says
"Submit Answers".  
$PAR
No matter whether your answer is right or wrong you should submit another
answer to see what happens then.
$PAR
If you have submitted a number that is not the correct answer you have been $BR
told that your answer is incorrect.  But now see what happens when you put a 
letter in the answer box.
$PAR
This time you saw a message.  It looks sort of complicated but tells you that $BR
that the letter you put in was not the kind of answer that was expected.
$PAR
Now suppose you want to see whether you can get away without doing any work.$BR
Try putting 1+1 in the answer box.
$PAR
The reason for the message you got is this.  This system was designed for $BR
college students and they are being tested on more complicated problems and so $BR
they are sometimes allowed to use + and other things in their answers and let$BRWeBWorK do the arithmetic.  But for students at your level this is not allowed. $BR
The problem is written with "contexts" to decide what kind of answers to accept.$PAR
There is another button that you probably wonder about.  It says "Preview Answer" $BR
It is there because some answers for complicated problems, especially at the college $BR
level are rather complicated and this allows students to make sure that they
typed $BR what they thought they did.
$PAR
There is probably one more thing that you want to know about.  Assignments are
$BR usually given on a certain day and must be "turned in" a few days later.$BR
During this period the problems are called "open".  After they are due they are
called "closed".  $BR
(Because this is a practice problem is is always kept open.)
$PAR
When a problem is open you can receive credit for answering it.  The teacher can$BR
decide how many tries you are allowed. When the problem is open there is a little $BR
line that tell you (and the teacher) how many times you have submitted answers.
