Use the bar graph above to fill in the blanks.

a) [_____]{$ans1}
people said that they get books in a bookstore or a library.

b) [_____]{$ans2}
more people said that they get books from the library
than said that they get books from a friend.

c) [_____]{$ans3} people in the survey did not get their books from
the library.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To tell how many people usually got books from the library, look at the
bar  above the word "Library".  Its height can be found from
seeing  where the line at the top of the bar would hit the
[`y`]-axis (if we continued it leftward) since the heights are marked there.
That height is the number of people who got books from the library and in this case, the answer is [$l].

We can find how many people got books from the bookstore or the library by adding the numbers for those two sources.  In this case, the answer is [$ans1].

To determine how many more people get books from a library than a friend, subtract the bar height of the friend bar from the bar height of the library bar or [`[$l]-[$f]=[$ans2]`].

The ways to find out how many people did not get their books from the library is to subtract the number who got their books from the library from 100. In this case, the answer is [$ans3].
