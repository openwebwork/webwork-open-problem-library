BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
If you don't think of the answer immediately, think of answers that you can eliminate.  $BR
A rectangle needs four right angles and this description does not require right
angles.$BR
A square also needs four right angles.$BR
Now, although something with four congruent sides is a parallelogram, a parallelogram does not$BR have to  have four parallel sides.  A rhombus is a parallelogram with four congruent sides $BR so "rhombus" is the best description.
