#THIS IS MORE RECENT VERSION INCLUDES STUFF FROM LAROSE PROBLEM #.
#This is the initialization section of the problem. Note that we need to include 
#PGgraphmacros.pl to use graphs in the problem.

# make sure we're in the context we want

# now initialize the graph

   Hint: The easiest way to do this problem is not to memorize a formula.$BR
Just put in additional lines between the vertices to divide the figure into
triangles.$BR  You know that a triangle has sum of measures of interior angles equal to 180 degrees.$BR  So just multiply the number of triangles you have created by 180.
END_TEXT
};
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
From the bottom vertex draw lines to the top 3 vertices.  Now you have 4 triangles.$BR  Each triangle has angle sum 180 degrees so the angle sum of this hexagon is 720 degrees.
