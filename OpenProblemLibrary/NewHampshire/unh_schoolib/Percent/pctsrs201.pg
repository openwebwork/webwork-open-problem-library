BEGIN_TEXT
Baseball batting averages are somewhat similar to percentages except that they
are usually rounded to three decimal places and include the decimal point.  That is, if a player got 3 hits in 10 at bats then she had a hit \(\frac {3}{10} = .300\) of the times she was at bat. Her batting average is listed as .300 in the newspapers.$PAR
a) If Fred got $hit1 hits in 50 times at bat, his batting average is \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
b) If Mary got $hit2 hits in $ab2 times at bat, her batting average is \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
If Mary got $hit2 hits in $ab2 times at bat, then she got $BR hits \{ans_rule(3)\}% of the times she was at bat.
$BR Answer should be correct to 1 decimal place.
$PAR
Jack's batting average is $ba3.  He was at bat $ab3 times.  That means he
got \{ans_rule(3)\} hits.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTIONS
In a) just divide $hits1 by 50 and round to three decimal places.$BR
Answer is $ans1.$PAR
In b) divide $hits2 by $ab2 and round to three decimal places.$BR
Answer is $ans2. $PAR
In c) Your answer should be a percentage.  So multiply the decimal
batting average in b) by 100.$BR
Answer is $ans3.$PAR
In d) since batting average is hits/(at bats), hits must be batting
average times at bats, $BR so multiply $ba3 by at bats and round the
answer to be an integer. $BR You must round because the batting average
is approximate since it is only calculated to 3 decimal places.$BR
Ans = $hits3.
