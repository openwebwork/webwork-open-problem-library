$PAR

In the diagrams above, we have used the letter x for the side of the larger square and the letter y for the area of the smaller square.$BR  When we multiply x by x
we will write the product as \(x^2\).$BR  Thus the larger square will have area
\(x^2\) square inches and the smaller square will have area \(y^2\) square inches. $BR We could use another letter for the length of the sides of square A, but we can see by the picture that the length of the side of square A $BR is just the length of the side of the big square minus the length of the side of square D  and
we can express this as x-y.  
$PAR
If x=10 and y=3 then x-y= \{ans_rule(1)\}.
$PAR
 In the rectangle in the right of the picture the bottom side has three parts
of length x-y, y, and y, respectively.$BR  If we add these together we get its length which is described in terms of the numbers x and y as \{ans_rule(2)\}.
$PAR
The large rectangle in the right of the picture thus has area \((x+y)\times (x-y)\) and that is the same as the area we get $BR
from removing a square of area \(y^2\) from a square of area \(x^2\).  Notice that this is true for any numbers x and y such that x is larger than y. $BR  This tells us that
$PAR
\( (x+y)\times (x-y) = x^2 - y^2\) 
$PAR
Now, we can make use of this equation to do some rather interesting things.
Suppose you were just learning the multiplication table. $BR  One interesting way
to start is to just learn those products that are squares.

$PAR
\( 1^2=\)  \{ans_rule(1)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 2^2=\)  \{ans_rule(1)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 3^2=\)  \{ans_rule(1)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 4^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 5^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 6^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 7^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 8^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 9^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
\( 10^2=\)  \{ans_rule(2)\} . 
$PAR 
Now, suppose you had forgotten \(9\times 7\). If you want to think of 9 as
x+y and 7 as x-y, what would x and y have to be.  You know that 
$PAR
(x+y) + (x-y) =  \{ans_rule(2)\}.
$PAR
So that means that x =  \{ans_rule(2)\}
$PAR

 Next notice that 9=8+1. 7=8-1 and, if you 
remember the squares you just notice that \(9\times 7 = 8^2-1^2=64-1=63\) 
$PAR
Suppose you had forgotten \(7\times 3\) .  You would just have to notice that
$BR
 \(7\times 3 =\)( \{ans_rule(1)\}+\{ans_rule(1)\})\(\times \)(\{ans_rule(1)\} -\{ans_rule(1)\} ) to use the
squares to find your answer.
