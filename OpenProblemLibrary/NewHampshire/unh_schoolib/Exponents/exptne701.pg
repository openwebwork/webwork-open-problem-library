This is a problem with multiple parts.  When you complete a part and are told that  your answers are correct
t then click to go on to the next part and resubmit your answer. When you do this ignore the statement that
 there are unanswered questions and just answer the new questions.
$PAR
When you first saw exponents they were positive integers.
$BR  They counted
the number of copies of the base that were to be multiplied together.
$BR
For example, \(5^3 = 5\cdot 5\cdot 5=125\).
$BR  You can refresh your memory
by calculating a few examples:   
$PAR
\(7^2=\)\{ans_rule(2)\}
$PAR
\(3^5=\)\{ans_rule(2)\}
$PAR
If someone asked you to compute \(3^0\) or \(9^{\frac{1}{2}}\) your 
reaction would be

 that the question is ridiculous $BR because you can't
multiply no threes together
 nor can you multiply a half of a nine
together, $BR and, based on what you have been taught so far
 your reaction
would be totally reasonable. 
$BR
 But mathematicians have found things
like \(3^0\) and \(9^{\frac{1}{2}}\) to be useful
$BR
 and they used a very important
technique to find a reasonable way to deal with them.  
$BR
Since this
method will arise in several topics you will study in middle and
high school,
$BR we will explain it in detail.
$PAR
The trick is to find an explanation other than
$BR
 " the number
of copies of the base to multiply together" for the exponent
$BR in
such a way that it will give the same result on the things we 
already know 
$BR
and enable us to use exponents that are not positive
integers.
$PAR
Suppose we let the positive number \(b\) be the base and make the 
following definition:
$BR
Rule 1: \(b^1=b\) 
$BR 
Rule 2: \(b^{n+1}=b^n\cdot b\)
$PAR
This definition must look strange to you so let us use it to find
\(5^3\).
$BR  
The base is \(5\) so we can use Rule 1 to say that \(5^1=5\).
$BR

Now that we know what \(5^1\) is we can use Rule 2 to say that
\(5^2=5^{1+1}=5^1\cdot 5 =5\cdot 5=25\). 
$BR
 Next we can use Rule 2
to say \(5^3=5^{2+1}=5^2\cdot 5 =25\cdot 5=125\).  
$BR
This is much uglier than just saying that \(5^3=5\cdot 5\cdot 5\).
But now we can do some neat tricks with it.
$PAR
Notice that in Rule 2 we did not say that n had to be a positive
integer. 
 So we will use the definition$BR to find out what \(5^0\)
has to be. 
 But you can do some of the work.
$PAR 
We know from rule 1 that \(5^1=5\).
  From Rule 2 we can say
That \(5^{0+1}=5^{0}\cdot 5\). 
$BR Now if \(5^0\) is a number which
multiplied by 5 gives us \(5^{0+1}\) 

then we know that
 \(5^0\) = \{ans_rule(1)\}

BEGIN_TEXT
Part 2:
Recall that we are looking at the consequences  the following two rules for exponents.
$PAR
Rule 1: \(b^1=b\) 
$BR 
Rule 2: \(b^{n+1}=b^n\cdot b\)
$PAR
Now you have seen how we showed that \(5^0=1\).$BR
You  can use the same technique that \(7^0=1\).  
$BR
Now you are probably tempted to believe that if \(n\) is any number
then \(n^0=1\).
$BR
But that is false and let us see why.  Let's try to see what \(0^0\) 
must be.
$PAR
Certainly we can use Rule 1 to say that \(0^1=0\). Now we use Rule 2 to say \(0^{0+1}=0^0\cdot 0\). 
$BR 
This tells us that \(0=0^0\cdot 0\).
$BR
But, unfortunately this tells us nothing since if we multiply any 
number by 0 we get 0. 
$BR
So these rules do not tell us what \(0^0\) should be.
$PAR
Well, you may say, we should use common sense to figure out what 
\(0^0\) has to be.
$PAR
You might say $PAR 
Claim 1:  If for any positive number n, \(n^0=1\) then \(0^0\)  should be 1.
$PAR
Now let's see what is wrong with this reasoning.  First, we know that \(0^1=0\).$$BR
Notice that \(0^2\) (the result of multiplying two zeros together) is also \(0\).$BR In fact, \(0^n=0\) for any positive integer \(n\). 
So you could say $PAR

Claim 2:  If for any positive number n, \(0^n=0\) then \(0^0\) should be 0.
$BR
The two claims are equally strong, and it turns out that there is no reasonable way to
define \(0^0\).
$PAR
Now we will go a few steps further.  Using Rule 2 and the fact that
you know that \(5^0=1\) find each of the following.
$PAR
\(5^{-1}=\) \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
\(5^{-2}=\)\{ans_rule(5)\}.

BEGIN_TEXT
Part 3:


Now we will try to figure out how to extend to fractional powers.  At this
point you will just have to believe that it will be useful.
$PAR
If you just look at positive integer powers you can see that \(5^4\cdot 5^3=5^7\)
$BR
This comes from the fact that if you multiply four fives together and then
multiply this by the product of three fives you end up by multiplying seven
fives together.$BR  Using the same reasoning you can see that positive integer
powers satisfy:
$PAR
Rule 3: \(b^m\cdot b^n=b^{m+n}\).
$PAR
If you think a bit about what you have done with negative integer powers
you can see that this rule works for them too. 
$BR So we will add Rule 3  to our
rules for exponents (so that it applies to all exponents).$PAR
This may worry you a bit.  How can we just make up such rules? $BR
Well, since we have no way to interpret powers that are not positive integers,
in terms of multiplying copies of the base together $BR
and since the rule works when in the case of positive integers, we are making
an extension and can only judge whether it is useful.  
$PAR
Now we will look at what happens when we extend this rule to the situation
in which \(m \)and \(n \) are permitted to be fractions.
$BR
We will first look at an example.  Use Rule 3 to answer the next question.
$PAR
 \(5^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 5^{\frac{1}{2]}=\) \{ans_rule(2)\}

BEGIN_TEXT
Part 4:
$PAR
Now we have  the following three rules for exponents.
$PAR
Rule 1: \(b^1=b\) 
$BR 
Rule 2: \(b^{n+1}=b^n\cdot b\)
$BR
Rule 3: \(b^m\cdot b^n=b^{m+n}\).
$PAR
$PAR
Now since \(5^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot 5^{\frac{1}{2}}=5\) we know that 
$BR 
 \(5^{\frac{1}{2}}\) is a number that, when multiplied by itself gives the product 5.
$BR 
Actually there are two numbers that satisfy that condition, namely \(\sqrt{5}\) and \(-\sqrt{5}\)
$BR
 but we add the rule that we always choose the positive
root when faced with such a choice. 
$BR
You might want to check that for integer values of n this rule is satisfied.
$PAR
Rule 4: If \(b\) is positive then \(b^n\) is positive for any n.
$PAR
Now we know that  \(5^{\frac{1}{2}}= \sqrt{5}\).  
$BR
To put in \(\sqrt{5}\) as an answer you must type it as sqrt(5).  Check that it works for you.
$PAR
 \(5^{\frac{1}{2}}=\) \{ans_rule(4)\}

if ($part == 6) {

$ans14="root[6](7)";
BEGIN_TEXT
Part 6:
$PAR
To deal with more complicated fractional exponents we must start by 
listing a few consequences of Rule 3.
$PAR
 Rule 3a:  \(b^{nk}=(b^n)^k\)
$PAR
An example of this rule is that \(5^{3\cdot 2}=(5^3)^2\).
$BR
Notice that all the example says is that if we multiply six fives
together that is the same thing as multiplying the product of three
fives by itself.  You can check that Rule 3a is certainly true for
integer exponents, for example
$PAR
\(2^{3\cdot 3}=( a^b)^c \) where a, b, and c are the integers:
$PAR 
a= \{ans_rule(1)\} $BR
b= \{ans_rule(1)\} $BR
c= \{ans_rule(1)\} 
$PAR
Earlier we used the fact that
$BR \(5^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot 5^{\frac{1}{2}}=5\).
 in order to show that \(5^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{5}\).  
$BR 
Another way of saying the same thing is that \((5^{\frac{1}{2}})^2=5\) and
this means that  \(5^{\frac{1}{2}\times 2}=5\)
$PAR
Using this second approach we can see that  \(5^{\frac{1}{3}\times 3}=5\).$BR
This tells us that \(5^{\frac{1}{3}}\) is a number whose third power is 5. The
mathematical notation for this is \(\root 3 \of 5\) $BR and it is called the cube root
of 5 or the third root of 5.  It would be very difficult
for you to use this notation to answer WeBWorK questions. $PAR  We will invent a special notation for answering WeBWorK questions. $BR If n > 2 then we will use
root[n](k) for \(\root n \of k\).

and so \(5^{\frac{1}{3}}\)=root[3](5).  

$BR The sixth root of 7 is the positive number whose sixth power is 7.
It is written \{ans_rule(8)\}

Part 7:
Now, we will put all of our information together to deal with some
$BR
problems that even many college students have great trouble with.
$PAR
We will first interpret \(4^{\frac {3}{2}}\).
$BR \(4^{\frac {3}{2}}=4^{\frac {1}{2}\cdot 3}= \(4^{\frac {1}{2}}^3\)
$BR But we know that \(4^{\frac {1}{2}}=2\).
$BR So  \(4^{\frac {3}{2}}=2^3=8\).

$PAR
Now, we always want our expressions as simple as possible.$BR
  \(9^\frac{1}{2}\)
could be written root[2](9) $BR or it could be written \(\sqrt(9)\) $BR
or it could be written 3.  
$BR But since 3 is so much easier to understand, we will insist that if an
answer is really an integer $BR we will call that integer the "best" form
of the answer. $BR  If not and if the answer is the square root of an integer
then we will call that the best form.  $BR If it is neither an integer nor the
square root of an integer, we will use the root[a](n) notation where n is an
integer.
$PAR
Find the best form for each of the following. $PAR

$PAR 


\(8^{\frac{2}{3}}= \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR 
\(3^{\frac{3}{4}}= \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
\(32^{\frac{2}{5}}= \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

\(16^{\frac{3}{2}}= \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
