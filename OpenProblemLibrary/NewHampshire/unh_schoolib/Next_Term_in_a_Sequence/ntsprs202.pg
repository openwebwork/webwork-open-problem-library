   Hint: In these problems you should look to see what changes as you go
from one number to the next.  It may be that each time the same number is
added or subtracted (such a list is called an arithmetic sequence).  It may be that
each number is multiplied or divided by the same number (then the list is 
called a geometric sequence).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
$a1, $a2, $a3, $a4, $a5,...  is called a geometric sequence since each term is the same multiple$BR (in this case $d1)  of the previous one.  Thus the next term is \($a5*$d1=$ans1\).$PAR
$b1, $b2, $b3, $b4, $b5.... is called and arithmetic sequence since the difference between$BR successive terms (in this case $d2) is the same.  Thus the next term is \($b5+$d2=$ans2\).$PAR
$c1, $c2, $c3, $c4, $c5,... is an arithmetic sequence with difference $c3 so the next term is \(c5+$d3=$ans3\).
