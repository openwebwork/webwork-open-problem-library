BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In this problem the lists are called arithmetic sequences, that is, the differences between $BR successive terms are equal.$PAR
For $a1, $a2, $a3, $a4, $a5  the difference between successive terms is $d1 (for example \($a2-$a1=$d1\)).$BR So the next term is \($a5+$d1=$ans1\).
$PAR
For $b1, $b2, $b3, $b4, $b5 the difference between successive terms is $d2. So the next term is \($b5+$d2=$ans2\).
$PAR
For $c1, $c2, $c3, $c4, $c5  the difference between successive terms is $d3. So the next term is \($c5+$d3=$ans3\).
