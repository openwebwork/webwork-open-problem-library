BEGIN_TEXT
The product of a set of consecutive integers is 720.  If the mean is 3.5 $BR
then the sum of the numbers is
\{ans_rule(2)\}.

END_TEXT

ANS(Real($ans)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The first thought that you may have is that you have no idea of how
many integers are in the set.$BR
But since this is a set of consecutive integers with mean 3.5, it must
contain as many greater$BR 
than 3.5 as less than 3.5.  Also, it can't contain 0 since if it did, the
product would be 0.$BR
Thus you need only try the sets {3,4}, {2,3,4,5} and {1,2,3,4,5,6}.$BR
The last one works.
