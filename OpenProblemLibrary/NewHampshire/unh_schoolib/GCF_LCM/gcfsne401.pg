$PAR
There is another neat way to use prime factorization.  The ${BITALIC}greatest common divisor$EITALIC (also called greatest common factor) of two numbers is the largest number that divides each of them.  For example, the greatest common divisor of 8 and 12 is 4.  The ${BITALIC}least common multiple$EITALIC of two numbers is the smallest number that both of the numbers divide.  The last common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24.  
$PAR
Now, when we write the prime factorizations of 8 and 12 we see that \(8=2^3\)
and \(12=(2^2)*3\).  Notice that for the prime 2, we have the third power in
8 and the second power in 12.  Thus the second power of 2, that is, 4 must
divide both numbers. Since the prime 3 does not occur in 8, it can't be a factor
of the greatest common divisor.  Thus the greatest common divisor of \(2^3\)
and \((2^2)*3\) is \(2^2\).
$PAR
We think similarly to find the least common multiple of \(2^3\)
and \((2^2)*3\) .  For the least common multiple we need the highest power of
2 in either of the factors since that power of 2 must divide the least common multiple.  Similarly we need the highest power of 3.  Thus the least common multiple must be \((2^3)*3\).  
$PAR
It is interesting to notice that the product of 12 and 8 is 96 and so is the product of  gcd(12,8) and lcm(12,8). [Here we write gcd(12,8) for the greatest common divisor of 12 and 8 and lcm(12,8) for the least common multiple of 12 and 8.
You must suspect that this is not a coincidence.  Now let's see why that is true.
We will write the equation using the prime factorizations.  
$PAR  
\([(2^2)*3]*[2^3]= [2^2][(2^3)*3]\)
$PAR
Notice that the gcd takes the smaller powers of both 2 and 3 [formally we
think of \(2^3\) as \((2^3)*(3^0)\) while the lcm takes the larger powers of
2 and 3 so everything in the first product has somewhere to go in the second
product.  This line of thinking tells us that the prouct of the lcm and gcd
of two numbers will always be the product of the two numbers.  
$PAR
1)  gcd(10,11)=\{ans_rule(3)\}, while lcm(10,11)=\{ans_rule(3)\}
$PAR
2)  gcd(12,20)=\{ans_rule(3)\}, while lcm(12,20)=\{ans_rule(3)\}
$PAR
3)  gcd(36,60)=\{ans_rule(3)\}, while lcm(36,60)=\{ans_rule(3)\}
$PAR
4)  gcd(45,75)=\{ans_rule(3)\}, while lcm(45,75)=\{ans_rule(3)\}
$PAR
5)  gcd(28800,138240)=\{ans_rule(3)\}, while lcm(28800,138240)=\{ans_rule(5)\}
$PAR
You can probably see that when the numbers get large, even prime factorization
is not terribly fast.

$PAR Solution $PAR
1) Since 11 is a prime gcd(10,11) must be 1.  Thus the lcm is the product.$PAR
2) gcd(12,20)=4.  If you don't notice this immediately you can use the fact tha$BR \(12=2^2\times 3\) and \(20=2^2\times 5\) to see this. $BR
 So lcm(12,20) = \(\frac{12\times 20}{4}=60\).$BR
  Or you might just have noticed the lcm by looking.$PAR
I hope that you are getting the idea that it is easier to find the gcd than the
lcm. $BR Thus, in a messy situation it is usually best to first find the gcd even if $BR you are asked for the lcm. Now we will just solve the messiest

$PAR
What have I done here?$BR  I took out primes one at a time from both numbers and 
put them into the gcd. $BR My last gcd, gcd(5,24)=1 since 5 is prime and does not divide 24. Thus $PAR
 \( \gcd(28800,138240)=2^7\times 3^2\times 5=5760\) $PAR
Wasn't that horrible?  I just gave it to you so that you would appreciate the$BR
