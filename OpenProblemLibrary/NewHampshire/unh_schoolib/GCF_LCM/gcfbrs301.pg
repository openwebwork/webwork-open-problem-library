  Hint: If you find it easier to find the greatest common factor of two
numbers then you can use the fact that \( lcm(x,y) = \frac{x\times y}{gcf(x,y)}\).$PAR
If the numbers are small it is easier to multiply one of the numbers by all prime factors of the other number that it does not contain.  For example to find
lcm(15,63) you can notice that \(15=3\times 5\) and \(63=3\times 3\times 7\).
63 has a 7 and an extra 3 that 15 does not have so lcm(15,63) = \(15\times 3\times 7=315\)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
There are several good ways to find the least common multiple of two numbers.$BRLet's try a few of them to demonstrate how to find the least common multiple of$BR 64 and 40.
Method 1.  First factor the numbers completely.  \(64=2^6\) and \(40=2^3\times 5\).  The least common multiple will have to have as factors \(2^6\) (otherwise 64 would not$BR divide it) and 5 (other wise 40 would not divide it).  Since it has a factor of \(2^6\)$BR which is a higher power of 2 than \(2^3\), 40 will certainly divide it.
$PAR
So the least common multiple of 64 and 40 is \(2^6\times 5=320\).
$PAR
Method 2. It can be shown (and this will be done in a more advanced problem) that  $BR the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their least common $BR multiple and their greatest common factor. That means that the LCM of two
$BR two numbers is their product divided by their GCF.$BR
The GCF of 40 and 64 is 8.  So the LCM is \(\frac{40\times 64}{8}=320\)
