For each of the following pairs of numbers, find the GCF.  [In more

common divisor) rather than GCF (greatest common factor)].

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Sometimes it is easy to see the greatest common factor of two numbers.  
If you are trying a problem that does not look easy, it is often helpful to
just do it one piece at a time.  

$PAR
Suppose you wanted to find GCF(120,168).  Well you can see that 2 divides both
so put a 2 on your GCF list and divide the two numbers by 2 to see that you
are now looking for GCF(60,84).  You might now notice either 2 or 4 is a factor of both.  Suppose you noticed 4,  Put it on your GCF list and divide to see that now you want GCF( 15,21).  Now you see 3, which you can put on your GCF list 
and look for GCF(5,7).  But that is 1.  So you can multiply the numbers on your GCF list to get \(2\times 4\times 3=24\) and so 24 is your GCF.

$PAR
In other cases, there is a method known as the Euclidean Algorithm which can
compute GCF's without factoring.
