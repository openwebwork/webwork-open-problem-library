BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Notice that \($b = $a^2\) so $b is not prime.  $PAR
To check that $d is prime (which it is), all you have to do is try possible
divisors \(\le \sqrt{$d}\) since if $d is the product of two numbers each 
greater than 1 then the smaller of them cannot be larger than \(\sqrt{$d}\)
