Factoring a positive integer into a product of primes.

This is a teaching problem with multiple parts.$BR  Its object is to show you how to factor positive integers. $BR When you complete a part and are told that  your answers are correct then$BR click to go on to the next part and resubmit your answer.$BR When you do this ignore the statement that there are unanswered questions$BR and just answer the new questions.
  
$PAR
Suppose you want to factor the number $n. $BR
How would you start?  $PAR
An approach that will always work is to check for prime factors one at a time, $BR starting with the smallest prime 2.  If a integer is divisible by 2 it ends
with either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.$PAR
If $n is divisible by 2 then put a 2 in the first answer box and $n divided by 2 in the second, $BR
otherwise put a 1 in the first answer box and $n in the second. $PAR

But $n222337 is a prime.  So it is the last prime in our factorization and $PAR
\($n=2^3* 3^2* 7*11\)$PAR

Of course, once you understand how to do this, you can take shortcuts.$BR
If you recognize that $n is divisible by 11 then, if you divide by 11 first $BR the numbers you have to work with after that will be smaller than if you$BR
 followed the procedure we have just completed.  However, if you are stuck,
$BR the procedure you just used will always work.
