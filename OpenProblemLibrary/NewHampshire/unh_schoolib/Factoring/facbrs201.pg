a number.$BR
  Then you are told that the number is prime.  Answer that T (for true) or F (for false).

   Hint: If $b is composite then it must have a divisor greater than one but not greater than its square root.  Thus the largest prime less than or equal to the square root of $b is the largest prime you must test.

If a number, N,  is not prime then it is the product of two numbers, each of which is greater than 1.$BR The smaller of these numbers must be less than or equal to the square root of N,$BR for if both were larger than the square root of N then their product would be greater than N.$BR
If a divisor, D, of N is not prime then there must be a prime divisor, P, of D, and P will also be a divisor of N (and smaller than D).
