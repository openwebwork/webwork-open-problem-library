a number.$BR
  Then you are told that the number is prime.  Answer that T (for true) or F (for false).

If a number, N,  is not prime then it is the product of two numbers, each of which is greater than 1.$BR The smaller of these numbers must be less than or equal to the square root of N,$BR for if both were larger than the square root of N then their product would be greater than N.$BR
If a divisor, D, of N is not prime then there must be a prime divisor, P, of D, and P will also be a divisor of N (and smaller than D).
