   Hint: Look for evidence that will help eliminate wrong answers.$PAR
Are any answers equations of lines? These can't be correct since the graph is not a line?$PAR
This graph has a maximum (highest y value), are there answers you can eliminate because. $BR they don't have maximums?
$PAR If more than one answer is left, can you eliminate any because you can see a point$BR that is on the graph but does not satisfy the equation in that answer?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
A look at the graph  gives us the following information.$PAR
i) The answer cannot be \(y=$a+x\) since that is the equation of a line.$PAR
ii) The answer cannot be \(y=x^2-$a\) for two reasons.$BR
  First, when \(x=0\ \)  \(x^2-$a =-$a\) and we know from the graph that when
 \(x=0\ \) \(y=$a\)$BR
  Second, this graph has a maximum (0,$a) and  \(x^2-$a\) has no maximum as \(x\) increases.$PAR
iii) The answer cannot be \(y=-x^2\) since for that function when \\(x=0\ \ ) \(-x^2=0\)$BR
 and we know from the graph that when  \(x=0\ \ \) \(y=$a\).
$PAR
To make sure, we might want to check that the remaining answer, \(y=$a-x^2\).$BR It has the correct maximum at (0,$a) and the graph looks like a parabola.  If
we $BR were certain that the points at which the function crosses the x axis were $BR \(-\sqrt{a},0\) and \(\sqrt{a},0\) then we could be more sure, since ( just as the $BR equation of a line can be found from knowing two points, the equation $BR of a parabola can be found from knowing three points.
