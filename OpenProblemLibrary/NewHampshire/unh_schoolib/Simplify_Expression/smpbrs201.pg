BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) \(($a+m)+$b\).  Since $a and $b are numbers we can add them to get \($a+$b=$c\) $BR Although it is not necessary, we usually write variables before numbers so $BR the usual form of the answer would be m+$c although $c+m would be acceptable. $PAR
b) \($e\times(k\times $f)\) Here we can multiply \($e*$f =$c1\) and write our answer as $c1 k.$PAR
c) \($b(x + $f)=$b x +$b*$f = $b x +$c2\).  $PAR
If you are familiar with the associative law you may notice that we used it in a) and b)$BR [first the associative law for addition and then for multiplication]$BR and then the corresponding commutative laws.  In c) we used the distributive law.
