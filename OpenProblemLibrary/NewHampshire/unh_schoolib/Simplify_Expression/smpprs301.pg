BEGIN_TEXT
   Hint: First find the reduced fraction  created by the integer parts. Then, for each of p and q look to see whether the higher power is in the numerator or denominator and subtract the lower power from the higher power and put it where
the higher power had been.  For example, if the p factors looked like \(\frac{p^3}{p^5}\) then your answer would have \(p^2\) in the denominator.

$PAR Solution $PAR
First reduce the number part \(\frac{$a}{$d}=\frac{7}{$s}\).$PAR
Then, since \($b-$e=$b1\ \ \),   \(p^{$b1}\) appears in the numerator.$PAR
Since \($c-$f=-$f1\ \ \), \(q^{$f1} \) appears in the denominator.
