For these problems, if the answer is an amount of money it must be preceded by
a $ (Dollar sign);
$PAR
1. Sandwiches at the diner are $DOLLAR$a, a salad costs $DOLLAR$b and a glass of juice
costs  $DOLLAR$c. A family went to the diner and ordered $na sandwiches, $nb salads and $na glasses of juice.
$PAR
The family will have to pay \{ans_rule(3)\} for the $na  sandwiches.
$PAR
The family will have to pay \{ans_rule(3)\} for the $nb salads.
$PAR
The family will have to pay \{ans_rule(3)\} for the $na glasses of juice.
$PAR
The total bill will be \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
2.  The hobby shop sells many different varieties of kites.  Box kites are  $DOLLAR$pa, diamonds are $DOLLAR $pb, and dragon kites are  $DOLLAR$pc. 
$PAR
a)  Mr. Sanders bought 2 box kites and 2 diamond kites for his 4 children.  He spent \{ans_rule(3)\} for them.
$PAR
b)  Ms. Byars bought 3 box kites and 2 dragon kites for her 5 children She spent \{ans_rule(3)\} for them.
$PAR
3)  At a state fair, the Lanier family had $sinventory jars of their homemade jelly to sell.  Large jars were $DOLLAR $qb each and small jars were $DOLLAR $qc each.
$PAR 
a)  If you bought $qg large jars and $qh small ones you would pay \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
b)  By the end of the day, the Laniers sold $slarge large jars of jelly.  They made $DOLLAR $smade in all.  That means that they must have made  \{ans_rule(3)\} selling small jars.
$PAR
c)  They sold \{ans_rule(3)\} small jars of jelly.
$PAR
d)  The had \{ans_rule(3)\} jars left over.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTIONS $PAR
1. If sandwiches are $DOLLAR$a then $na sandwiches cost $na($Dollar$$a)=$ans1
  Similarly the salads will cost  $nb($Dollar$$b)=$ans2
  And the drinks will cost $na($Dollar$$c)=$ans3
  The total bill will be the sum of these amounts which is $ans4
$PAR
2.  Same rule, multiply the number of each kind of kite by the number
of kites of that type and sum so answer is:$BR
Mr. Sanders spent 2($DOLLAR$pa)+2($DOLLAR$pb)=$ans5.$BR
Ms. Byars spent 3($DOLLAR$pa)+2 ($DOLLAR$pc)=$ans6.$BR
$PAR
3a.  $qg($DOLLAR$qb) +$qh ($DOLLAR$qc) = $ans7 $PAR
3b  $s large jars sold for $slarge($DOLLAR$qb)=$ans8. $BR
The rest of their
income $DOLLAR$smade - $ans8 =$ans9 must have come from selling small jars.
$PAR
3c  We divide $ans8 by $DOLLAR$qc (the price of small jars) to get $ans19
$PAR
3d. The number of jars left is the initial inventory $sinventory minus the 
number of large jars sold ($slarge) minus the number of small jars sold ($ssmall) = $sleft.
