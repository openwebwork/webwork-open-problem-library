A taxi company charges $first for the first half mile and $rest
for each quarter mile after that. Shawn rode a taxi and paid a fare of $fare.

Shawn travelled \{ans_rule(3)\} miles in the taxi.$PAR
Give the answer as a mixed number.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Of the fare, $first paid for the first half mile.  That left $q for the
remainder$BR of the trip.  Dividing $q by 0.35 gives the number of additional 
quarter miles, which is $a.$BR  So adding the first half mile to the $a quarter miles to give the answer of $ans miles
