BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In the original mixture there was \(0.30\times $b=$lityellow\) liters of yellow tint.$BR In the new mixture there is \($lityellow+$b=$newlityellow\) liters of
yellow.$BR  The number of liters of the new mixture is \($a+$b=$newtotal\).$BR
Thus, the answer  (before rounding) is \((100\times \frac{$newlityellow}{$newtotal}=$unrounded\)%.
