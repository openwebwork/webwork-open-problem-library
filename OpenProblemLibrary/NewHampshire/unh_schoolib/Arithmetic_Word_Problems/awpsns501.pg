$PAR
John's room is shaped like a box. It has a flat ceiling that is a rectangle that is $BR $a feet long and $b feet wide and the walls are $c feet high.$BR
It has one door that is $d feet high and 3 feet wide. $BR
 It has two windows that are each $e feet high and $f inches wide. 
$PAR
John wants to paint the walls and ceiling, but not the door or windows. $BR
 He can paint 100 square feet with a quart of paint and paint costs $h per quart.$BR

He has to buy whole quarts and may have some paint left over.
$PAR It will cost John $Dollar\{ans_rule(3)\} to paint his room.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The area of the ceiling is \($a*$b=$ab\ \) square feet.$BR  Two sides (walls plus door) are \($a*$c=$ac\ \) square feet each.$BR
The other two walls are \($b*$c=$bc\ \) square feet each. $BR
The door is \(3*$d=$td\ \) square feet.
Each window is \($e*\frac{$f}{12}=$ef \) square feet.$BR (Notice that the width is given in inches.)$BR
Thus, the area to be painted is \($ab+2\times $ac+2\times $bc-$td-2\times $ef =$w\ \) square feet.$BR
The actual number of quarts of = paint needed is \( \frac{$w}{100}\) but that means that John$BR must buy $p quarts and thus pay  ($ans).
