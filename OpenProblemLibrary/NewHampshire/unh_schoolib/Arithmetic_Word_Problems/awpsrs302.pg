$PAR
1)  Sadee has $q quarters.  She wants to put them in paper rolls.  Each roll holds 20 quarters.
a)  The number of rolls that will be completely filled is \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
b)  The number of quarters in the unfilled roll is \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
2)  Bukka has $p paperback books.  He wants to put his paperback books on storage shelves.  Each shelf can hold $s paperback books.
$PAR
a)  The number of shelves that will be completely filled is \{ans_rule(3)\}.
$PAR
b)  The number of paperback books that will be on the shelf that is not completely filled is \{ans_rule(3)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
1.  To solve this you must both the quotient and remainder obtained in dividing
$q by 20.$BR The quotient, $q20, is the number of rolls, the remainder $r is the number in the unfilled roll.$PAR
2. This problem is solved just as the first.  The quotient dividing $p by $s (which is $sf)$BR is the number of filled shelves.  The remainder ($sremain) is the number of books on the shelf $BR that is not completely filled.
