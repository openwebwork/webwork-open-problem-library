BEGIN_TEXT
Angelina's goal for each five-day work week is to have average total sales
of $DOLLAR $a per day.  For the first four days of this week her average total 
sales was $DOLLAR $b per day.  In order for her to meet her goal for the week 
her average total sales for the fifth day must be 
\{ans_rule(8)\}

			return $correct . $student == 0;
		}
	
	)));

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
To reach her goal, Angelina needs \(5\times $a=$fa\) sales.  For the first four days
she $BR made \(4\times $b=$frb\) sales.  She needs \($fa-$frb=$ans\) more sales.
