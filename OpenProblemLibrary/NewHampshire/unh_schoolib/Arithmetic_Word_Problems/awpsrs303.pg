$PAR
1) The cafeteria workers keep small milk cartons in the refrigerator in stacks of $d1 .
If each worker carries no more than one stack then at least \{ans_rule(1)\} cafeteria
workers needed to carry small milk cartons for a class of $c1.
$PAR
2) In the teacher's lunchroom, teachers sit at tables for $d2 . There are $c2 teachers eating lunch, so \{ans_rule(1)\} tables must be set up.
$PAR
3) A truck is loaded with $c3 kilograms of food.  Each box of food weighs $b3 kilograms.  That means that there are \{ans_rule(2)\} boxes on the truck.
$PAR
4)  There are $c4 auto parts to be packed for a shipment with as many boxes full as possible.  The parts are to be packed $d4 to a box.  There will be 
\{ans_rule(2)\} full boxes and \{ans_rule(2)\} parts left over.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solutions $PAR
1. One way to use the fewest workers is to have as many workers as possible carry full loads$BR of $d1 cartons and if there are any left over to have a last worker carry those.$BR  If you divide $c1 by $d1, if your answer is an integer then there are no leftovers and $BR your answer is your quotient.  Otherwise your answer is 1 more that the integer part of the quotient$BR  In this case \($c1=$d1\times$a1+$b1\) so $ans1 workers are needed.
$PAR
2. The same idea as in the first part.  \($c2=$d2\times $a2+$b2\) so the answer is $ans2$PAR
3.  Here we know there should not be any remainder since they would not carry boxes that$BR  are not full. \($c3=$a3*$b3\) so the answer is $a3.
$PAR
4  This is more like the first 2 parts. \( $c4=$d4\times $a4+$b4\) so there are $a4 full boxes and $b4 pieces left over.
