This is a problem with multiple parts.  When you complete a part and are told th
at  your answers are correct then click to go on to the next part and resubmit y
our answer. When you do this ignore the statement that there are unanswered ques
tions and just answer the new questions.

$PAR
Here we are going to explore something that you will probably find very
mysterious. 
$PAR
First, think about the areas of squares.  There is certainly a square
of area 1 square unit,$BR
 since we know that if we make its sides each
1 unit then its area must be \(1\time 1\) square unit.$BR  Similarly there
is certainly a square of area 4 square units  since its sides would have
length 2 units. $BR  Now suppose we gradually shrink the lengths of the
sides of a square of area 4 square units $BR until we reach size 1 square
unit. $BR Then, do you believe that somewhere during the shrinking we will
have a square of area exactly 2 square units?
$PAR
Most people believe that there is such a square.  If there is, then its
sides have length \(\sqrt{2}\) units.$BR  Now the ancient Greeks, who were
the first Westerners to study geometry $BR first thought that every length
was some fraction of a unit.  Let us see whether that is true.
$PAR 
Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) is a fraction.  Then, since every fraction can be
reduced to lowest terms $BR we can say that
 $PAR
\(\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}\) where \(\frac{p}{q}\) 
is reduced to lowest terms, $BR that is, 
\(\ p\ \) and \(\ q\ \) are integers and no integer greater than 1 divides both\(p\) and \(q\).
$PAR
Now if two numbers are equal so are there squares so if  \(\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}\) $BR then \(2= (\frac{p}{q})^2= \frac{p^2}{q^2}\).
$BR
But this means \(p^2=2\cdot q^2\) and so  \(\ p^2\ \) must be even 
since 2 times any integer is an even integer.
$PAR
Now, I will ask a little help from you.  Fill in the following information.
$PAR
\(0^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR
\(1^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(2^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(3^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(4^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(5^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(6^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(7^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(8^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(9^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$PAR
Now, without squaring it out, you can see that the last digit of
$BR
\(283859908828888997687654867987617^2\) must be  \{ans_rule(2)\}

Part 2:
$PAR
Since you have gotten to here I guess that you must have figured out
two things.
$BR 1. The last digit of the square of any number is the same as the last
digit of the square of its last digit.  
$BR For example, the last digit of 
\(283859908828888997687654867987617\) is \(\ 7\ \) 
$BR and the square of \(\ 7\ \) is \(\ 49\ \) 
$BR and the last digit of the square of
 \(283859908828888997687654867987617^2\) must be \(\ 9\ \)
$BR
2. If a number is odd then its square must be odd and if a number is even its
square must be even.
$PAR
Now, we know that \(\ p^2\ \) is even, so \(\ p\ \) must be even.  
$BR Since  \(\ p\ \) is even it must be twice some integer, let's say
that integer is  \(\ s\ \)
$PAR
Now we have \(p=2s\) so \(p^2=(2s)^2=4s^2\)
$PAR
But that means that \(2=\frac{p^2}{q^2}=\frac{4s^2}{q^2}\) 
so \(2q^2=4s^2\).
$PAR
So \(q^2=2s^2\). But then \(q^2\) is even.  So \(\ q\ \) is even.
$PAR
Something is wrong. If both \(\ p\ \) and \(\ q\ \) are even then
$BR \(\frac{p}{q}\) is not in least terms since 2, which is greater
than 1 divides both \(\ p\ \) and \(\ q\ \).
$PAR
What happened.  Did we make a mistake? No, check and you can see that
everything we said was correct.
$PAR
The only possible explanation is that we assumed something that was
not true. What did we assume?
$PAR
We only assumed that \(\sqrt{2}\) is a fraction. That must be the thing
that is untrue.
$PAR
So  \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot be a fraction.
$PAR 
Now, I will ask you to help in explaining the consequences of that fact.
$PAR
Write each of these number as a fraction with integer numerator whose denominator is a power of 10
$PAR
\(1.4\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
\(1.41\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
\(1.414\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
\(1.4142\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_TEXT
Part 3:
$PAR
Since you got to here you have probably figured out that if a number
has a decimal part that ends, it must be a fraction. $BR
So that means that \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot have a decimal part that ends.
$PAR
But \(\frac{1}{3}=.33333\cdots\) has a decimal part consisting only
of 3's and it does not end.
$BR
We call such a decimal part \(repeating \) since 3 repeats forever.
So it looks like we need to do some more investigating. 
$PAR
Divide
 the numerators of each of the 
following fractions by the denominators. $BR
 Each will be a repeating decimal so  you just need to tell what
number repeats.
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{4}{9}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{43}{99}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{254}{999}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{3477}{9999}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}

Part 4:
$PAR
Since you have gotten this far, I am pretty sure that you know the
answer to this question, but just to check:
$PAR
The number \( .43527435274352743527\cdots \) which repeats the number 43527 forever can be written as the fraction \{ans_rule(12)\}

if ($part == 5) {

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_TEXT
Part 5:
$PAR
Now, to get here, you must have been able to see that if a number
is just a repeating decimal it is a fraction.  
$BR
But a number that is an integer plus a repeating decimal is also a 
fraction , $BR
for example,
\(2345.6969696969...\) is just the 
$BR sum of two fractions, \(\frac{2345}{1}\)
and the fraction \( \frac{69}{99}\) and their sum is a fraction.
$PAR
So, since \(\sqrt{2}\) is not a fraction it not only has a decimal
part that never ends, it has a decimal part that is not repeating.
$BR Doing a bit more of what we just did, you can show that it cannot
even repeat $BR starting at some point far out in the decimal part.  
$PAR
I told you at the beginning that this would be mysterious
