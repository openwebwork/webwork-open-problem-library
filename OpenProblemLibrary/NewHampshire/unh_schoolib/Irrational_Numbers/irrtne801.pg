This is a problem with multiple parts.  When you complete a part and are told that
your answers are correct then click to go on to the next part and resubmit your answer.
When you do this ignore the statement that there are unanswered questions and just answer the new questions.

$PAR
Here we are going to explore something that you will probably find very
mysterious. 
$PAR
First, think about the areas of squares.  There is certainly a square
of area 1 square unit,$BR
 since we know that if we make its sides each
1 unit then its area must be \(1\times 1\) square unit.$BR  Similarly there
is certainly a square of area 4 square units  since its sides would have
length 2 units. $BR  Now suppose we gradually shrink the lengths of the
sides of a square of area 4 square units $BR until we reach size 1 square
unit. $BR Then, do you believe that somewhere during the shrinking we will
have a square of area exactly 2 square units?
$PAR
Most people believe that there is such a square.  If there is, then its
sides have length \(\sqrt{2}\) units.$BR  Now the ancient Greeks, who were
the first Westerners to study geometry $BR first thought that every length
was some fraction of a unit.  Let us see whether that is true.
$PAR 
Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) is a fraction.  Then, since every fraction can be
reduced to lowest terms $BR we can say that
 $PAR
\(\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}\) where \(\frac{p}{q}\) 
is reduced to lowest terms, $BR that is, 
\(\ p\ \) and \(\ q\ \) are integers and no integer greater than 1 divides both\(p\) and \(q\).
$PAR
Now if two numbers are equal so are there squares so if  \(\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}\) $BR then \(2= (\frac{p}{q})^2= \frac{p^2}{q^2}\).
$BR
But this means \(p^2=2\cdot q^2\) and so  \(\ p^2\ \) must be even 
since 2 times any integer is an even integer.
$PAR
Now, I will ask a little help from you.  Fill in the following information.
$PAR
\(0^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR
\(1^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(2^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(3^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(4^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(5^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(6^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(7^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(8^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$BR 
\(9^2\) =  \{ans_rule(2)\} 
$PAR
Now, without squaring it out, you can see that the last digit of
$BR
\(283859908828888997687654867987617^2\) must be  \{ans_rule(2)\}

Part 2:
$PAR
Since you have gotten to here I guess that you must have figured out
two things.
$BR 1. The last digit of the square of any number is the same as the last
digit of the square of its last digit.  
$BR For example, the last digit of 
\(283859908828888997687654867987617\) is \(\ 7\ \) 
$BR and the square of \(\ 7\ \) is \(\ 49\ \) 
$BR and the last digit of the square of
 \(283859908828888997687654867987617^2\) must be \(\ 9\ \)
$BR
2. If a number is odd then its square must be odd and if a number is even its
square must be even.
$PAR
Now, we know that \(\ p^2\ \) is even, so \(\ p\ \) must be even.  
$BR Since  \(\ p\ \) is even it must be twice some integer, let's say
that integer is  \(\ s\ \)
$PAR
Now we have \(p=2s\) so \(p^2=(2s)^2=4s^2\)
$PAR
But that means that \(2=\frac{p^2}{q^2}=\frac{4s^2}{q^2}\) 
so \(2q^2=4s^2\).
$PAR
So \(q^2=2s^2\). But then \(q^2\) is even.  So \(\ q\ \) is even.
$PAR
Something is wrong. If both \(\ p\ \) and \(\ q\ \) are even then
$BR \(\frac{p}{q}\) is not in least terms since 2, which is greater
than 1 divides both \(\ p\ \) and \(\ q\ \).
$PAR
What happened.  Did we make a mistake? No, check and you can see that
everything we said was correct.
$PAR
The only possible explanation is that we assumed something that was
not true. What did we assume?
$PAR
We only assumed that \(\sqrt{2}\) is a fraction. That must be the thing
that is untrue.
$PAR
So  \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot be a fraction.
$PAR 
Now, I will ask you to help in explaining the consequences of that fact.
$PAR
Write each of these number as a fraction with integer numerator whose denominator is a power of 10
$PAR
\(1.4\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
\(1.41\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
\(1.414\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
\(1.4142\)= \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_TEXT
Part 3:
$PAR
Since you got to here you have probably figured out that if a number
has a decimal part that ends, it must be a fraction. $BR
So that means that \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot have a decimal part that ends.
$PAR
But \(\frac{1}{3}=.33333\cdots\) has a decimal part consisting only
of 3's and it does not end.
$BR
We call such a decimal part \(repeating \) since 3 repeats forever.
So it looks like we need to do some more investigating. 
$PAR
Divide
 the numerators of each of the 
following fractions by the denominators. $BR
 Each will be a repeating decimal so  you just need to tell what
number repeats.
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{4}{9}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{43}{99}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{254}{999}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The number that repeats when we write \(\frac{3477}{9999}\) as a decimal is   
 \{ans_rule(10)\}

Part 4:
$PAR
Since you have gotten this far, I am pretty sure that you know the
answer to this question, but just to check:
$PAR
The number \( .43527435274352743527\cdots \) which repeats the number 43527 forever can be written as the fraction \{ans_rule(12)\}

# Part 5

if ($part == 5) {

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_TEXT
Part 5:
$PAR
Now, to get here, you must have been able to see that if a number
is just a repeating decimal it is a fraction.  
$BR
But a number that is an integer plus a repeating decimal is also a 
fraction , $BR
for example,
\(2345.6969696969...\) is just the 
$BR sum of two fractions, \(\frac{2345}{1}\)
and the fraction \( \frac{69}{99}\) and their sum is a fraction.
$PAR
So, since \(\sqrt{2}\) is not a fraction it not only has a decimal
part that never ends, it has a decimal part that is not repeating.
$BR Doing a bit more of what we just did, you can show that it cannot
even repeat $BR starting at some point far out in the decimal part.  
$PAR
I told you at the beginning that this would be mysterious
