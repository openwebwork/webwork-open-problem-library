 BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) First reduce your fraction so that the numerator and denominator have no common
factors (greater than 1).$BR In this case you can either do this by dividing by common factors you see or by noticing that $gcdab1 is the$BR greatest common facter of $a1 and $b1.  $PAR
So  \(\frac{$a1}{$b1}=\frac{$aa1}{$bb1}\). 
$PAR Now, some mathematicians might be satisfied with \(\frac{$aa1}{$bb1}\), butI think that  most middle school texts$BR would expect a mixed number with fractional part less than 1.  Thus the answer desired was probably \($q1\frac{$r1}{$bb1}\)$BR which is obtained by dividing $aa1 by $bb1 and finding the quotient and remainder.
$PAR
b) is solved in the same way.
