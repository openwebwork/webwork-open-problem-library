This is a problem with multiple parts.  When you complete a part and are told that$BR
  your answers are correct then click to go on to the next part and resubmit your answer.$BR
 When you do this ignore the statement that there are unanswered questions$BR
 and just answer the new questions.
$PAR
Multiplication of fractions is somewhat puzzling because it is not easy to$BR 
see what it has in common with multiplication of integers.  We will start
by trying to $BR 
explain this with pictures.  Let's look at a picture of how we multiply 8 by 3.$BR
If you have ever used Cuisenaire Rods, this might be familiar. $PAR
To multiply 8 by 3 we construct a rectangle with length 8 units and height 3 units. $BR We
start by taking 8 unit squares in a row to make area 8. (see top of picture)$BR
Now to multiply by 3 we add two more rows of length 8 units, making a rectangle$BR
consisting of 3 rows of length 8 and the area of that rectangle (24 unit squares)$BR
 is 24 which is the product of 8 and 3.
$PAR
Now we will try to see what happens if we multiply 8 by a fraction.  It is easiest$BR
to start with what is called a unit fraction (a fraction with 1 in the numerator) $BR
Let's look at \(\frac{1}{2} \times 8\).  To use the same idea as we did in$BR multiplying 8 by 3, this time we would want a rectangle of length 8 and height  \{ans_rule(1)\}

Part 2:$BR
Now look at the lower part of the picture.  We have 8 parts each of which 
is half a unit square$BR and they add up to \( \frac{8}{2} \) units in area.
But we can think of this in another way. $BR We multiplied \(\frac {8}{1}\)
unit squares by \(\frac{1}{2}\) to get \( \frac{8}{2} \) units.  So we
ended up  by multiplying the numerator of our original \(\frac {8}{1}\) $BR
by the numerator of  \(\frac{1}{2}\)  and did the same thing with the
denominators. $BR.  If you think about it a bit this idea will work the
same way if we multiply by any fraction with numerator 1. $BR

Suppose we want to multiply 8 by \(\frac{5}{2}\).  Well, \(\frac{5}{2}\)
is \(5\times \frac{1}{2}\) so $PAR
 \(\frac{5}{2}\times 8= 5\times\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{8}{1}= 5\times \frac{8}{2} =\frac{40}{2}\) $BR

so again the result is the same as if we had just multiplied the numerators
and denominators together.  $BR The example does not really prove that this is
true for any  pair of fractions, but that can be $BR proven without too much
additional trouble. Also, since we usually want reduced fractions as our 
answers $BR we would reduce \(\frac{40}{2}\) to 20 for a final answer.

Now make sure that you really understand this by finding$BR the reduced fractions
obtained from the products below:



$PAR
 \(\frac{27 } {10 } \times \frac {25 } {12 } =\)\{ans_rule(3)\} 
$PAR
 \(\frac{33 } {28 } \times \frac {42 } {11 } =\)\{ans_rule(3)\} 
$PAR
 \(\frac{68 } {35 } \times \frac {14 } {17 } =\)\{ans_rule(3)\}
