1) To put \(\frac{$a1}{$b1}\) into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator  by 2 $BR (which is their greatest common factor) to get answer
\(\frac{$c1[0]}{$c1[1]}\) which we put in the answer box as \($c1[0]/$c1[1]\).$PAR

2) To put \(\frac{$a2}{$b2}\) into simplest form we must divide both numerator and denominator $BR by $g2 to get answer
\(\frac{$c2[0]}{$c2[1]}\) which we put in the answer box as \($c2[0]/$c2[1]\).$PAR
