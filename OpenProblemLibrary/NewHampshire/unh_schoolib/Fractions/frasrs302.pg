BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
In this problem your answer must be a proper fraction (with numerator less
than denominator) or a mixed number where the fraction is a proper fraction.
$PAR
\(\frac{$a1}{$a2} + \frac{$b1}{$b2} +\frac{$c1}{$c2}= \)
\{ans_rule(5)\}

END_TEXT

ANS($ans->cmp);

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
First, we put all of our fractions over the least common denominator (the least common multiple of$BR the denominators of the fractions) which in this case is
$lcd . Then we add the numerators and reduce the $BR resulting fraction.  If the fraction is improper we present our answer as a mixed number $PAR
\(\frac{$a1}{$a2} + \frac{$b1}{$b2} +\frac{$c1}{$c2}=\frac{$mma}{$lcd}+\frac{$mmb}{$lcd}+\frac{$mmc}{$lcd}=\frac{$mm}{$lcd}=\frac{$gca}{$gcb}=$q\frac{$r}{$gcb}\)$BR
Notice, if the answer fraction is already reduced, it will appear twice.
