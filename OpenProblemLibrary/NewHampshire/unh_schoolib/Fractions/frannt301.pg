Part 3:
$PAR
Now, to make the situation more clear, we have taken the previous picture 
and added all the fraction values.  However we have done it in an unusual way.$BR
We have used colors to indicate the denominators.  The color green means that 
the denominator 4 (that is a green 1 means \(\frac {1}{4}\)).  The color red $BR
means that the denominator is 2 and the color blue means that the denominator 
is 3.  Notice that since \(\frac {2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \) the third marked point $BR has both a red 1 and a green 2 beneath it.
$PAR
Now there is another (very useful) way of thinking about this.  If we think of
the part of the number line as a sort of ruler, then its length is 2.  That $BR
means that it is two units long, where a unit is measured by the distance from the
0 at the left we have to go to reach 1.  Thus its end is 2 units from 0 and is marked by a black 2. $BR
$PAR
But suppose we thought of our unit as being the distance we had to go from the
left to reach \(\frac {1}{3}\).  Since thirds are represented by the blue color$BR
we will call these blue units. Then the end is 6 blue units from 0 and is marked by a blue 6. 
$PAR
Our ruler is \{ans_rule(1)\} green units long.
$PAR
It takes \{ans_rule(1)\} green units to equal 3 blue units.

Part 4:

Now we will do something that seems very strange but will help explain something

our ruler by the number of 1's.
$BR
We will call our red units are "half-units" since they measure our ruler by the 
number of \(\frac {1}{2}\)'s.

We will call our blue units are "one-third-units" since they measure our ruler by the 
number of \(\frac {1}{3}\)'s.
$BR
We will call our red units are "quarter-units" since they measure our ruler by the 
number of \(\frac {1}{4}\)'s.
$PAR
Nothing unusual yet. But now suppose we know the number of units of one color
for a certain length and want to know the number of units of another color for
the same length.  $BR  Well, let's experiment with an example.
We will compare various lengths in green units and black units.  Some we
will take from our ruler and some from a longer ruler that we can imagine.$BR
We will make a table with the first row for green units and the second
row for black units.  I will fill in some numbers and you will fill in others.$BR
Remember that a number in the first row is some length in green units and the
number below it is the same length in black units.

First lets notice that every number in the second row is equal to the
number in the number above it divided by four, or, said in another way,$BR
every number in the first row is four times the number below it.  Should
this be surprising?$PAR
If you think it over, it should not be surprising.  Since it takes four green
units to make a black unit, the number of green units it takes to add
up to a certain length$BR should be four times the number of black units.  or, in
other words, the number of black units it takes to add up to that length should be one quarter of the number of green units.
$PAR
Now lets talk about this example in one more way, replacing our "color"
language by "unit" language$BR
It takes four times as many  quarter-units to make a number as it takes units.
It takes one quarter the number of units to make a number as it takes quarter-units.
$PAR
Let's see if you are comfortable with these ideas.
$PAR
It takes  \{ans_rule(1)\} quarter-units to make 4 units.
$PAR     
It takes  24 quarter-units to make   \{ans_rule(1)\}  units.

\(\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{4})}=4\).
$PAR
Looking again at our table, we see that \(\frac{3}{(\frac{3}{4})}=4\).
$PAR
This illustrates the fact that we can divide by a fraction by inverting
(turning over) the fraction in the denominator and multipying it by the
numerator.$BR  For example, since  \(\frac{3}{(\frac{3}{4})}=4\) we can
dividing both sides by 3 to see that \(\frac{1}{(\frac{3}{4})}=\frac{4}{3}\)
$PAR
So, for example, if we wanted to divide \(\frac{9}{4}\) by \(\frac {3}{8}\)
and wanted to end up with a reduced fraction $BR
(no integer greater than 1 dividing
both numerator and denominator) we would proceed as follows:
$PAR
\( \frac{(\frac {9}{4})}{(\frac{3}{8})}= \frac {9}{4}\times \frac{8}{3}=\frac{72}{12}=6\)

$PAR
Now you can try a few:

$PAR
\(\frac{(\frac {9}{4})}{(\frac {27}{8})}=\)  \{ans_rule(1)\}
$PAR
\(\frac{(\frac {11}{9})}{(\frac {77}{45})}=\)  \{ans_rule(1)\}
$PAR
\(\frac{100}{(\frac {75}{4})}=\)  \{ans_rule(1)\}

Part 8:

Now that you have gotten this far, we can mention one more
interesting thing that you can do with what you have learned. $BR
Sometimes it is important to know which of two fractions is larger.
When the fractions are ugly, this can look difficult.  For
example, you might be asked which of \(\frac{203}{307}\) and 
\(\frac{29}{44}\) is larger.  

$PAR
Here is an easy way to think about this kind of problem. Suppose a number \(a\) 
is less than a number \(b\).  Which of the three statements below is true: 
$PAR
1)  \(\frac{a}{b} <1\)
$PAR
2)  \(\frac{a}{b} =1\)
$PAR
3)  \(\frac{a}{b} >1\)
$PAR The true statement is the one with label \{ans_rule(1)\}

Part 9: 
So, using the fact that  \(a < b\)  if  \(\frac{a}{b}<1\) we  can answer
the question which of \(\frac{1}{4}\) and 
\(\frac{2}{9}\) is larger. $BR Letting our a be  \(\frac{1}{4}\) and
letting b be \(\frac{2}{9}\) we see that$BR

 \(\frac {\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{2}{9}}=\frac{1\times 9}{4\times 2} =
\frac{9}{8}\).$BR   

Since this number is greater than 1,  \(\frac{1}{4}\) must be larger than \(\frac{29}{44}\) 
$BR

Notice that we are using the fact that if a is not less than b and is not equal to b it must be greater than b.
$PAR
Now to check your under standing, in each case below determine which of the  in each pair is larger [write 1 if the first number is larger, 2 if the second
number is larger.

$PAR
\(\frac{3}{4}\) or \(\frac{7}{10} \) . Number \{ans_rule(1)\} is greater.
$PAR
\(\frac{2}{5}\) or \(\frac{3}{7} \) . Number \{ans_rule(1)\} is greater.

Now there is another way of finding out which is the larger of two 
fractions. We can subtract one from the other. $BR If we subtract the
number b from the number a, the result is positive if \(a>b\) and 
it is negative if \(b > a\).  $PAR
So to see which of \(\frac {1}{3}\) and \(\frac{2}{5}\) is larger, we
find
$PAR \(\frac {1}{3} - \frac{2}{5}\)
$PAR \(\frac {1}{3} - \frac{2}{5}=\frac {1\times 5- 3\times 2}{3\times 5}=
\frac{-1}{15}= -\frac{1}{15}\) which is negative.
$PAR Thus \(\frac{2}{5}\) is larger than \(\frac{1}{3}\).

$PAR 
Now try the subtraction method to determine which of the  in each pair is larger [write 1 if the first number is larger, 2 if the second
number is larger.]
$PAR
\(\frac{1}{4}\) or \(\frac{3}{10} \) . Number \{ans_rule(1)\} is greater.
$PAR
\(\frac{3}{5}\) or \(\frac{4}{7} \) . Number \{ans_rule(1)\} is greater.

Congratulations, all of your answers are right. $PAR
Now might have looked at the work involved in the division method and
commpared it with the work done in the subtraction method and decided that
the subtraction method was more work.  $BR
However, we can take a short cut in the subtraction method. In introducing it
we said $PAR
So to see which of \(\frac {1}{3}\) and \(\frac{2}{5}\) is larger, we
find
$PAR \(\frac {1}{3} - \frac{2}{5}\)
$PAR \(\frac {1}{3} - \frac{2}{5}=\frac {1\times 5- 3\times 2}{3\times 5}=
\frac{-1}{15}= -\frac{1}{15}\) which is negative.
$PAR Thus \(\frac{2}{5}\) is larger than \(\frac{1}{3}\).
$PAR
Now look very carefully at what was done.  All that we really had to do was
to see that the numerator of the sum ( \(1\times 5- 3\times 2\) ) was negative
to know that the fraction would be negative since the denominator will
always be the product of two positive denominators.  Thus the subtraction method might be shorter after all.
