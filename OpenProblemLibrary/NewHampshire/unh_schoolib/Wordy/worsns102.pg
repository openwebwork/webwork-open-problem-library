BEGIN_TEXT
John is wearing a red shirt and has a red die.  Mary is wearing a green sweater and has a green die.$BR  They are rolling their dice in a contest with a first prize of $DOLLAR 10.  They each roll their dice. $BR  The probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of the two dice is 2 is \{ans_rule(3)\}.$BR
Your answer should be a reduced fraction.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
There is one relevant fact in the description.  A pair of dice is rolled.$BR
In order for the sum to be 2, each die must show a 1 on top.  Since there are$BR
6 faces on a die, the probability that a die shows a 1 is \(\frac{1}{6}\) and $BR so the probability that both dice show 1's is \(\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}\).
