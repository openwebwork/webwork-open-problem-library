BEGIN_TEXT
Max has a rectangular plot that is $a square meters in area. He keeps his five goats,$BR
his twelve chickens  and his brown and white horse in the plot which is enclosed $BR on all four sides by a white picket fence.  The length of the plot is
10 meters. $BR So the total length of the white picket fence is  
\{ans_rule(1)\} meters.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
If the length of the plot is 10 meters and the area is $a square meters then$BR
the width must be \($a/10=$f\) meters.  The length of the fence is the perimeter$BR of the plot which is \(2\times 10 +2\times $f=$ans\) meters.
