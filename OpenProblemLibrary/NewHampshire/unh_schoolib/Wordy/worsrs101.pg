$p   = randomPerson();
$f   = random(5, 9);
$a   = 10 * $f;
$ans = 2 * $f + 2 * 10;
BEGIN_PGML
[$p] has a rectangular plot that is [$a] square meters in area. [$p->They] keeps [$p->their] five goats,
[$p->their] twelve chickens  and [$p->their] brown and white horse in the plot which is enclosed
on all four sides by a white picket fence.  The length of the plot is
10 meters. 

So the total length of the white picket fence is  [_]{$ans} meters.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
If the length of the plot is 10 meters and the area is [$a] square meters then  
the width must be [`[$a]/10=[[$f]]`] meters.  The length of the fence is the perimeter
of the plot which is [`2\times 10 +2\times [$f]=[$ans]`] meters.
