Lucy uses 4 round beads and 5 cube head beads to make a special necklace.  Lucy bought $BR one package of 56 triangular beads, one package of 30 round beads, six bananas, $BR one package of 24 cube head beads, and three fish sandwiches.  She usually $BR makes her necklaces in the living room, but today she plans to make them 
in her bedroom.$PAR
She can make \{ans_rule(1)\} special necklaces with her purchases.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
She has only 24 cube head beads and must use 5 in each special necklace.  Thus she$BR can't make more than four necklaces (since for that she would need to use
20 cube $BR head beads.  Since she has 30 round beads she can use 16 of them to
complete 4 necklaces.$BR  Whether she eats a fish sandwich or a banana before or after $BR making the necklaces is up to her.  The triangular beads can be used for her$BR next project.  Her mother will probably ask her to clean up her bedroom after $BR she makes the necklaces.
