BEGIN_TEXT
A model car has a scale factor of \(\frac{1}{64}\) $BR
The diameter of a tire on the model is $a inches.
$PAR
So, the diameter of the tire on an actual car must be \{ans_rule(2)\} inches.
$BR
Your answer must be correct to one decimal place.
END_TEXT

ANS(Real($ans)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The scale factor is the ratio of the size of the model car to the size of an actual car.$BR
Thus the actual car is 64 times as large as the model.$BR So the diameter of the tire on the actual car is \(64*$a=$ans\ \)inches to one decimal place accuracy.
