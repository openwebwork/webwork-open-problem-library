$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Starting with \($b-3x\ge $a\) we can simplify by the following steps. $BR
Subtract $b from both sides to get \(-3x\ge $d\).$BR
Now divide both sides by -3 to get \(x \le $dd\).$BR
 [Remember that when you multiply or divide  an inequality through by a negative number$BR
 you reverse the inequality -  in this case changing \(\ge\) to \(\le\ \ ]\).
