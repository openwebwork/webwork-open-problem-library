$PAR Solution $PAR
The y intercept of the graph of a line is the point on the line where the x
value is 0.$BR.  So you find it by substituting 0 for x in the equation.$PAR
For the line  \( $a1 x +y =$b1\) we substitute 0 for x to get  \(\ \ $a1\times 0 +y =$b1\) so \(y =$b1\).$PAR


The x intercept of the graph of a line is the point on the line where the y
value is 0.$BR.  So you find it by substituting 0 for y in the equation.

$PAR For the line \(\ \ $a2 x +$b2 y =$c2\) we substitute 0 for y, getting 
\( $a2 x +$b2\times 0 =$c2\) so \( $a2 x  =$c2\) and,$BR dividing by $a2 we find
that the x intercept is $ans2.
