BEGIN_SOLUTION
The \(y\) intercept of the graph of a line is the point on the line where the \(x\)
value is 0.  So you find it by substituting 0 for \(x\) in the equation.
For the line  \( $a1 x +y =$b1\) we substitute 0 for \(x\) to 
get  \( $a1\times 0 +y =$b1\) so \(y =$b1\).$PAR


The \(x\) intercept of the graph of a line is the point on the line where the \(y\)
value is 0.
So you find it by substituting 0 for \(y\) in the equation.

$PAR For the line \( $a2 x +$b2 y =$c2\) we substitute 0 for \(y\), getting 
\( $a2 x +$b2\times 0 =$c2\) so \( $a2 x  =$c2\) and, dividing 
by $a2 we find
that the \(x\) intercept is $ans2.
