$PAR

 1 is the only number that has just one positive divisor and we call it a \(unit\). 1 divides every number.
$PAR
3 is a number that has exactly two positive divisors.  Its divisors are 1 and 3. A number with exactly two divisors is called a \(prime\).
$PAR
12 is a number with six divisors.  Its divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12.  A number with more than two positive divisors is called \(composite\).
$PAR
The smallest number that is a prime is \{ans_rule(2)\}.
$PAR
The smallest number that is composite is \{ans_rule(2)\}.
$PAR
There are  \{ans_rule(2)\} primes that are less than 10. 
$PAR
There are  \{ans_rule(2)\} composites that are less than 10. 
$PAR
The smallest prime greater than 50 is \{ans_rule(2)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR


1 is not a prime, nor is it composite, it is called a unit.  2 is a prime so it is $BR the smallest prime. 3 is a prime. 4 is a composite so it is the smallest composite.$PAR
The primes less than 10 are 2,3,5,7, so there are 4 of them. The composites less than 10 are$BR 4,6,8,9 so there are 4 of them$PAR
Since \(51=17\times 3\), \(52=2^2\times 13), and 53 is prime so it is the smallest prme greater than 50.
