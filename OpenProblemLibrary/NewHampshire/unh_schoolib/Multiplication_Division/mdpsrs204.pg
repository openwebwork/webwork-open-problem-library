BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Students often have difficulty in division when the divisor has digits to the right of the decimal point. $BR For example \(26 \div 1.3\). A good way to overcome
that difficulty is to multiply both dividend $BR and divisor by the appropriate
multiple of 10 to get rid of the decimal point in the divisor.$BR  In our example
we would multiply by 10 to replace the question by \(260 \div 13\) $BR
which has the same answer as the original problem.
