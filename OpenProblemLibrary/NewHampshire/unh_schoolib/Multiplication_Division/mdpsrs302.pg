$PAR
a) John has $a1 marbles.  If he gives all of his marbles to each of his $b1 friends$BR and gives the same number to each friend then
each friend will receive \{ans_rule(1)\} marbles.
$PAR
b) Mary's Bakery delivers a selection of cakes to its $b2 customers.  Each customer receives the name number of cakes. $BR She loads the delivery truck with $a2 cakes so that each customer will receive \{ans_rule(1)\} cakes.
$PAR
c) Jesse's zoo has $b3 monkeys.  Each morning he brings a total of $a3 bananas which are shared equally by his monkeys.$BR  Each monkey gets   \{ans_rule(1)\} of the
bananas.
$PAR
d) Oswald mother gave him $b4 anteaters.  Each day exactly $a4 ants try to eat the
crumbs on Oswalds floor. $BR The anteaters eat all of those ants, being very careful to share equally.  So each anteater eats exactly \{ans_rule(1)\} ants.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
All of these problems are division problems because a certain number of things
are divided into $BR a certain number of (say) piles, one pile for each recipient.$PAR

a) In this problem the questions are worded so that there are an equal number of
marbles for each friend $BR (with none left over).  That means that if when you
divide you find that you have a remainder you $BR
can be pretty sure that y ou have done something wrong.$PAR
All of the other problems give you a similar chance to check even if you were not
told by WeBWorK whether you were right.
