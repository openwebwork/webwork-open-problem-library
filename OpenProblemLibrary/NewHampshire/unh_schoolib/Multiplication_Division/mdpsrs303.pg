$PAR
a) Charles has $a1 cookies and wants to share them with his $b1 
friends.  He wants to give each friend the same number of 
cookies and make sure that he has given away as many as he
can in that way.  He will eat any that are left over.$BR
Charles will give each friend \{ans_rule(2)\} cookies and 
eat   \{ans_rule(2)\} himself.
$PAR
b) There are $b2 big fish in Lake Hiawatha.  Each morning $a2 small
fish swim into the lake from the Hiawatha river.$BR  For as long as there
are enough small fish for each large fish to get at least one, the large
fish eat one small fish per minute.$BR  But when there are not enough left
to go around, the large fish start fighting and the remaining small fish
all escape.$BR  This means that each large fish eats \{ans_rule(2)\} small
fish and  \{ans_rule(2)\} escape.
$PAR
c) Max has a birdhouse with $b3 feedholes through which a birdfeed pellet can be made to
fall into a tray for a hungry bird. $BR In order for any bird to be fed there must be a bird at each feedhole and each bird must peck at a button above its feed
hole $BR within 5 seconds of hearing a bell ring.  If they do that, and there are at least $b3 pellets in the food bin, $BR one pellet will
fall from a central food bin into each feedhole.  A group of $b3 sparrows have learned how to use this feeding device.$BR  When Max puts pellets in the food bin
the bell rings once a minute and the birds eat until they cannot get any more 
food. $BR
 If Max puts $a3 pellets into the food bin $BR each bird can eat \{ans_rule(2)\} pellets
and  \{ans_rule(2)\} pellets are left in the bin (because there are not enough
left to provide one for each bird).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In all of the parts of this problem you have to divide and find a quotient and
a remainder $PAR
a) When we divide Charles' $a1 questions among his $b1 friends the quotient is
the number $BR of cookies that each friend receives and the remainder is the number that Charles eats.  $BR
The other problems work in the same way.
