Since the Gauss trick only depends on the fact that we are summing numbers that are equally spaced, we can now
try it on summing odd numbers.
$PAR
First, for something that you can check easily by hand, 
$PAR
The sum of all of the odd numbers up to 5 ( that is, 1+3+5) is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The sum of all of the odd numbers up to 19 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The sum of all of the odd numbers up to 21 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The sum of all of the odd numbers up to 999 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
If you look at your answers carefully you might see something interesting.  We will see more about this in future problems but try
to guess what might be going on.
