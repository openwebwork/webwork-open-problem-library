BEGIN_TEXT
\(5+8+11+14+17\) is called an arithmetic progression or sometimes, an arithmetic sequence.. 
 Surprisingly when the word 'arithmetic' is used as an adjective
it is pronounced differently from when it is used as a now.  Here it is pronounced as if the word "met" was the important sound.  
$PAR
More specifically, it is
called an arithmetic progression of five terms with difference 3.  An arithmetic progression always has a starting number and a constant difference.
This means that we can use the Gauss trick to find the sum which is  \{ans_rule(5)\} . Notice that the  difference between the first and last term is  \{ans_rule(5)\}.
which is 5 -  \{ans_rule(5)\}.
$PAR
Now we will find the sum of an arithmetic progression of 201 terms starting with 7 and having differnce 4.  That means our progression will start out
$PAR
\( 7 + \) \{ans_rule(5)\} \( + \)  \{ans_rule(5)\}. The last term will be \(7+4\times\) \{ans_rule(5)\} which equals  \{ans_rule(5)\} and so we can use the Gauss trick to see that the sum is \{ans_rule(5)\}
