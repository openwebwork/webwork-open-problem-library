Let's try a strange way to add the numbers from 1 to 6.  We will use the letter S to represent the sum.
First we will write the sum forwards and then we will write it backwards.  
$PAR
\(S=\ \ 1\ +\ 2\ + \ 3\ +\ 4\ +\ 5 \ + \ 6\)
$PAR
\(S=\ \ 6\ +\ 5\ + \ 4\ +\ 3\ +\ 2 \ + \ 1\)
$PAR
Now, if we added all of the numberrs together we would get the sum of the numbers from 1 to 6 multiplied by 2
(which we will call 2S.)  But we will do something different.  We will only add numbers that are above one another.
$PAR
\(S=\ \ 1\ +\ 2\ + \ 3\ +\ 4\ +\ 5 \ + \ 6\)
$PAR
\(S=\ \ 6\ +\ 5\ + \ 4\ +\ 3\ +\ 2 \ + \ 1\)
$PAR
\(2S= 7\ +\ 7\ + \ 7\ +\ 7\ +\ 7 \ + \ 7\)
$PAR
Now we see something interesting.  All of the numbers in the 2S line are 7's and there are 6 of them.  So 
$PAR
2S is the sum of six 7's and so is equal to \(6\times 7 \).  But S is half of that and so \(S = \frac {6\times 7}{2} = 21\)
$PAR
Using the same trick you can see that the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The sum of the numbers from 1 to 1000 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
This method of summing has an interesting history.  Karl Friedrich Gauss was one of the greatest mathematicians in history.
When he was 8 years old, his teacher, as a punishment, had his class sum all of the numbers from 1 to 1000.  Karl turned 
in his answer (on a slate which was what they  used in those days) in a few minutes.  His teacher did not look at the
slate but glared at Karl since he was sure that he could not have gotten a right answer and had just not done anything on
the problem.  When, after several hours, the other students had turned in their slates, Karl had the only correct answer.
His teacher, recognizing what tremendous talent Karl had, supplied him with advanced books which helped lead him into 
a career in mathematics.  For this reason,weI will refer to this summing method as "the Gauss Trick".
$PAR
Suppose we wanted to sum the numbers from 11 to 16.  Would the Gauss Trick work for that.Well, here 
$PAR
\(S=\ \ 11\ +\ 12\ + \ 13\ +\ 14\ +\ 15 \ + \ 16\)
$PAR
\(S=\ \ 16\ +\ 15\ + \ 14\ +\ 13\ +\ 12 \ + \ 11\)
$PAR.
\(2S= 27\ +\ 27\ + \ 27\ +\ 27\ +\ 27 \ + \ 27\)
$PAR
So our \(S =\frac{6\times 27}{2}=81\).

$PAR
Using the Gauss Trick, the  sum of the numbers from 50 to 80 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
The sum of the numbers from 100 to 10000 is \{ans_rule(10)\}
