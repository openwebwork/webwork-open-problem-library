Two balls were placed in a box.  Each ball was equally likelt to be red or green.$BR It is known that at least one of the balls is red.$PAR
The probability that both of the balls are red is \{ans_rule(2)\}

END_TEXT
ANS($ans->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
There are three ways that one of the balls can be red.$BR
The two balls can be red.$BR
The first ball can be red and the second ball can be green.$BR
The first ball can be green and the second ball can be red.$PAR
Thus of the three equally likely cases only one has both balls red so the probability is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
