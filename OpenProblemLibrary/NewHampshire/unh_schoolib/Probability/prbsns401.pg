BEGIN_TEXT
A bag contains four pieces of paper, each labelled withone of the digits 1, 2,
3, 4.$BR  You draw three pieces of paper (without replacement) to form a 3 digit
number (first piece of paper is first digit,etc).$PAR
The probability that your 3 digit numbe is a muliple of 3 is \{ans_rule(3)\}.$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
First we must figure out how many different 3 digit numbers we can make.  $BR
We can choose the first digit in 4 ways, then we can choose the second digit$BR in
three ways (because one of the sheets of paper is no longer in the bag),$BR then
we can choose the third $BR digit in 2 ways, so there are \(4\times 3\times 2=24\) possible numbers.  $PAR
Next we must figure out which of these work.  One way to do that is  to go down$BR
the list and  pick those that work.  They are:$BR
\(123= 3\times 41\)$BR
\(132  = 3\times 44 \)$BR
\(213  = 3\times 71 \)$BR
\(231  = 3\times 77 \)$BR
\(234= 3\times 78\) $BR
\(243 =3\times 81\) $BR
\(312  = 3\times 104 \)$BR
\(321  = 3\times 107 \)$BR
\(324 =3\times 108\)$BR
\(342= 3\times 114\) $BR

\(423 = 3\times 141\) $BR
\(432 = 3\times 144\) $BR So we have a total of 12 that work and so the probability is one half.$BR
A faster, way that you might have thought of, is to notice that a number is$BR
a muliple of 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.$BR  There are two sets of  numbers that add to a multiple of 3, {1,2,3} and {2,3,4}$BR and each of these can  be ordered in 6 ways.
