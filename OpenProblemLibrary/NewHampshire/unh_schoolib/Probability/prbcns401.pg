BEGIN_TEXT
The probability of winning a lottery game where the winning number is made up $BR of three digits from 0 to 9 chosen at random and the numbers may repeat is
\{ans_rule(6)\}. $BR
Your answer should be a reduced fraction.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR


There are 10 ways to choose the first digit, 10 ways to choose the second digit$BR and 10 ways to choose the third digit so there are$BR \(10\times 10\times 10=1000\) ways to  pick the 3 digit number.$BR  You have one 3 digit number so your probability of winning is \(\frac{1}{1000}\)
