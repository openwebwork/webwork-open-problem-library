BEGIN_TEXT
Seven cards, each containing one of the following letters$BR C, B, T, A, E, M, and H are placed in a hat.  Each letter is used only once.  Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement.  $PAR
The probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
Express your answer as a fraction (a/b).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
There are seven letters.$BR
To succeed, Stu must pull out an M first, the probability of doing so is \(\frac{1}{7}\).$BR
Now there are 6 letters remaining.  To succeed, Stu must pull out an A next. The probability of doing so is \(\frac{1}{6}\)$BR
The probability of pulling out a T next is \(\frac{1}{5}\)$BR
The probability of pulling out a H next is \(\frac{1}{4}\)$BR
Thus the probability of pulling out the letters M,A,T,H in this order is $BR
\((\frac{1}{7})(\frac{1}{6})(\frac{1}{5})(\frac{1}{4})=\frac{1}{$a}\).
