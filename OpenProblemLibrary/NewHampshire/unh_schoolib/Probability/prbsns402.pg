BEGIN_TEXT
Harry tosses a nickel 4 times. $PAR
The probability that he gets at least as many heads as tails is \{ans_rule(3)\}.

END_TEXT
ANS(Fraction("11/16")->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Notice that he can get 4 heads in just one way: namely HHHH.  $BR
He can get 3 heads in four ways:$BR
 HHHT (that is, a tail on his last toss), 
HHTH ( a tail on his next to last toss), HTHH, and THHH ;$BR
He can get 2 heads in 6 ways: HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, THHT, TTHH.$BR
Since there are \(2^4=16\) ordered ways that the nickel can land, the probability $BR of at least two heads (which guarantees that he gets at least as many heads as tails)$BR is \(\frac{6+4+1}{16}=\frac{11}{16}\).  $PAR
Another way of thinking of it is that after computing the number of ways of getting$BR 4, 3, 2 heads, we know there are 5 ways that heads exceed tail
$BR and that means that there must be 5 ways that tails exceed heads so we don't$BR really need to do anything more to know the denominator.
