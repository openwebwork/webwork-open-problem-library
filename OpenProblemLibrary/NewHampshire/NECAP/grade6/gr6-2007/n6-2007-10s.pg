BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The statement "Most people in the class are 42 years old " need not be true since $BR the mean only tells us that the average age is 42.  If half of the
class was 43 and half was 41 the mean would be 42.$PAR
The statement "The oldest person in the class is 50 years old " need not be true, the mode only $BRtells us that no other age group has more people in the class than
the age group of 50 year olds.$PAR
The statement "Each person in the class is either 36, 42, or 50 years old " need not be true, $BR indeed the only age group that is guaranteed to contain people is
the 50 year old age group. $PAR
The statement "At least half of the people in the class are 36 years old or younger" must be $BR true since that is exactly what the statement "the median is 36 years old" tells us.
