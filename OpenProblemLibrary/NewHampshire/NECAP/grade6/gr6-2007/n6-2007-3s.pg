BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Since the horizontal line marking the area of trees is half way between the top
line$BR and bottom line marking Gibson's land, the trees take up part of half of
his land$BR  Since the vertical line marking the area of trees is more than half
way from left to right $BR the trees take up more than half of the top half so
the trees take up between 25% and 50% of his land.
