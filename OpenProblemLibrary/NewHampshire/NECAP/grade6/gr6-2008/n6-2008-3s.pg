IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
Maria had   \(\frac{3}{4}\) yard of ribbon.   Then she used    \(\frac{1}{3}\)
yard of the ribbon to decorate a box.  $PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}


END_TEXT
ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The common denominator is the least common multiple of 4 and 3, which is 12.$PAR
  \(\frac{3}{4} -  \(\frac{1}{3}  =\frac{9}{12}-\frac{4}{12}=\frac{5}{12}\)
