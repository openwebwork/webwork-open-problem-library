IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
Three students collected data for a school project.$PAR
Anita asked her classmates which season they liked best.$PAR
Kevin measured and recorded the height of the snow in his backyard$BR
 every 15 minutes during a 2 hour snowstorm.$PAR
Rachel recorded the total snowfall in 3 different towns.$PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}

ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Both Anita and Rachel have data about pieces of distinct information. $BR Anita
knows how many classmates like each of the four seasons best.$BR.  Rachael
knows the total snowfall in three different towns.$BR  Since a line graph is used to display information for all values on the horizontal axis $BR
this data would not be appropriate for a line graph.$BR
If Kevin plotted his data with a time scale across the bottom and a height
scale going upward $BR then he could join points from times fifteen minutes apart since he could assume that$BR the snow was falling at a constant rate during
those fifteen minute intervals.
