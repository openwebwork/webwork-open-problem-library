BEGIN_TEXT
Jasmine drew a rectangle with the following properties.$PAR
The area is 32 square centimeters.$PAR
The length is twice the width.$PAR
The perimeter of Jasmine's rectangle is \{ans_rule(2)\} centimeters.

END_TEXT
ANS(Real(24)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The area is the length times the width, which we can write as \(A=lw\).$BR
Now, if we substitute \( 2w\ ) for \(\ l\ \) and 32 for A we obtain \(32=2w^2\ \) so \(w^2=16 \  \) and \(\ w=4\). $BR The perimeter is \( 2\times 2w++2\times w=6\times 4 =24\).$PAR
IN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NEAP EXAM YOU WERE EXPECTED $BR
 TO SHOW YOUR WORK.  SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION $BR
 ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
