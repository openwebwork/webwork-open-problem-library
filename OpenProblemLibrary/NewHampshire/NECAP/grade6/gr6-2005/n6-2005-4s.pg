If he can divide the chairs into at least two rows with the same number of chairs then$BR the number of chairs is the number of rows times the length of the rows$BR If the number of chairs is a prime number, it is impossible to do this
with$BR at least two rows and at least two chairs in each row. 19 is the only prime on the list.$PAR
