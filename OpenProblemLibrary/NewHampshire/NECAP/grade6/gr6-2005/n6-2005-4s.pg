A music teacher can arrange all of the chairs in the practice room into at least$BR rows(with at least two chairs in each row and) with the same number of chairs $BR in each row.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
If he can divide the chairs into at least two rows with the same number of chairs then$BR the number of chairs is the number of rows times the length of the rows$BR If the number of chairs is a prime number, it is impossible to do this
with$BR at least two rows and at least two chairs in each row. 19 is the only prime on the list.$PAR
THE PROBLEM ON THE NECAP EXAM DID NOT HAVE (with at least two chairs in each row and) $BR IN THE QUESTION.  THAT MADE THE QUESTION NONSENSE SINCE WE CAN HAVE ANY
NUMBER $BR OF EQUAL LENGTH ROWS IF ALL OF THE ROWS HAVE LENGTH 1.$BR
WHAT SHOULD A STUDENT DO IF SHE SEES A WRONG QUESTION LIKE THIS.  MY SUGGESTION IS $BR SHE SHOULD INFORM HER TEACHER THAT THE QUESTION IS WRONG BUT ANSWER THE 
WAY THAT $BR IS EXPECTED - IF THE PERSON WHO HAD WRITTEN THE PROBLEM HAD THOUGHT $BR TO EXCLUDE ROWS OF LENGTH 1.
