Look at this set of shapes.
$BR

\{ image( insertGraph($graph), tex_size=>$TEXSIZE,
    height=>$HEIGHT, width=>$WIDTH
    ) \}

$PAR
Ted painted each shape a color.$PAR
He painted \(\frac{1}{3}\) of  the shapes in this set blue.$PAR
He painted the rest of the shapes red.$PAR
He painted this fraction \{ans_rule(3 )\} of the shapes red.
END_TEXT
ANS(Real(2/3)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
If he painted \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the shapes in this set blue, then he painted one of $BR
the three shapes blue.  The other shapes form \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the set and those$BR
he colored red.
