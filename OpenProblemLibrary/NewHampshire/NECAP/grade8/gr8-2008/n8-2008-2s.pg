BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Notice if the ships had travelled \(2.3\times 10^1=2.3\times 10\) nautical miles
then they $BR then they would have travelled 23 nautical miles, that is, we
would move the decimal$BR point 1 place to the right. So, for our answer we must move the decimal point 7 places to$BR the right from 2.3, so there must be 8
digits to the left of the decimal point. $BR
That means that the answer is 23,431,671.
