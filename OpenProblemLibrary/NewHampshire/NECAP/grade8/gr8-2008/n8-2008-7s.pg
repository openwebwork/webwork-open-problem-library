Ian and Lauren are each making patterns that follow the same rule.$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In Ian's pattern, each number except the first is four times the number before it.$BR The same thing happens in the short part of Lauren's pattern that we see so
we assume$BR that is the rule.  So the answer is \((-8)\times 4=-32\)
