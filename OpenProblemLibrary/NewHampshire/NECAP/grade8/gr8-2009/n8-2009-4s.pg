$x = list_random(4, 5, 8, 10, 12);
$y = list_random(4, 5, 8, 10, 12);

$area  = Real($scale**2 * $x * $y);

BEGIN_PGML
To make a poster, Jeff will enlarge the length and width of a photograph by a scale factor of [$scale].  The photograph is [$x] inches wide and [$y] inches long.  What will be the area of the poster? 

Area = [_]{$area}{10} square inches

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Enlarging by a scale factor of [$scale] will change the [$x] inch width to [@ $x*$scale @] inches and the [$y] inch length to [@ $y*$scale @] inches.  The area will then be [`[@ $x*$scale @] \times[@ $y*$scale @] =[$area]`] square inches.
