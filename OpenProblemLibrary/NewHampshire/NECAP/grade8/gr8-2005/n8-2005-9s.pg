$PAR Solution $PAR
The mode ( the number that occurs most frequently) is 280 and will not change$BR
The median (the central number) is 280 and will change to 279.5 (the average of
280 and 279),$BR
Since the mean (the average of the numbers) is about 280 and we add 101 which is about 180 less $BR than the mean,
and there are now 10 values, the mean will decrease by approximately \(180/10=18\).
