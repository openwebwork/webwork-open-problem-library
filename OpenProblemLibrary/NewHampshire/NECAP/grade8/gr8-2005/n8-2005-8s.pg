the weight of 3 small boxes of cement.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
You have to subtract 2 pounds from the weight of 3 small boxes  to get the weight of the large bag.$BR This gives the equation \( 3w-2    =80\).  If you were not sure of what to do, $BR you could certainly eliminate the two equations that subtract
something positive from $BR a small number to get 80.  They are nonsense.
