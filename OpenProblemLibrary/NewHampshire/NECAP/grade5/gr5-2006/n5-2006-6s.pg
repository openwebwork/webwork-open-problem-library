IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR
 THIS IS A NEAP PROBLEM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR 

Quinn used a total of 56 apples to make pies.  Each pie was made with the same number of apples.$BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
This question is as it appears on the NECAP examination.  If I were writing the$BR question I would have written "Each pie was made with the same WHOLE number of apples" $BR to make sure that students understood that was what was meant, but$BR these practice problems are here to let you see what happens on the actual examination$PAR
The number of pies would have to divide 56.  Now \(56=2\times 2\times 2\times 7\). $BR  The only number on the list of choices that divides 56 is 7.
