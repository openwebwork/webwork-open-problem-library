There are 6 marbles in the bag.$PAR
The bag contains twice as many blue marbles as red marbles.$PAR

$PAR Solution $PAR
Since there are twice as many blue marbles as red marbles, the probability that$BR
the probability that Nadia picked a blue marble is \(\frac{2}{3}\).  $PAR
IN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NEAP EXAM YOU WERE EXPECTED $BR
 TO SHOW YOUR WORK.  SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION $BR
 ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.$PAR
Notice that you did not even need the information that there were 6 marbles$BR
