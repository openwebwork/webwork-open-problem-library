BEGIN_TEXT
Mrs. Sudha is filling snack bags.  She always puts $BR
3 cookies into each snack bag.  She wants to find the $BR
number of snack bags she can fill using 36 cookies.  One $BR
way she can solve the problem is this$PAR
Count the number of times 3 can be subtracted from 36 until 0 is reached. $PAR

\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}

ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Since she is putting 3 cookies into each snack bag, $BR the number of snack bags
times the number of cookies equals 36. $BR  Thus she must divide 36 by 3 to get the number of snack bags.
