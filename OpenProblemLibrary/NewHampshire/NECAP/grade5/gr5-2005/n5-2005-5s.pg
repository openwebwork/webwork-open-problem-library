$PAR Solution $PAR
If you had trouble with this problem, there are some techniques that might help$BR on similar problems.$PAR
First estimate your answer.  In this case 6.7 is about 2 more than 4.8.$BR
Notice that this eliminates two of the possible answers.$PAR
Now notice that the answer is less than 2 so 1.9 seems reasonable.$PAR
Last, add 1.9 to 4.8 to check your result.$BR (It is a good idea to check your
answer no matter how you arrived at it.)
