BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
\(6  = 5 + 1 \)  $BR
\(8  = 6 + 2 \) $BR
\(11  =8  +3  \) $BR
\(15  =11  +4  \) $BR
\(20  =15  +5  \) $BR
A good pattern observation is that the differences between terms increase by 1$BR as each new term is added.  Continuing this would give us.$BR
\( 26 = 20 +6  \) $BR
\(33  = 26 +7  \) $PAR
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT A NUMBER OF PATTERNS START IN THE SAME WAY AS THIS ONE, $BR AND THE PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THE SIMPLEST PATTERN, BUT ON THES $BR YOU WILL DO BEST BY GIVING THE EXPECTED ANSWER EVEN WHEN THE QUESTION IS NOT
WORDED PERFECTLY.
