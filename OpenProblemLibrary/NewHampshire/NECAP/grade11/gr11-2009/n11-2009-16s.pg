BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The slope of a line is measured by the change in the y coordinate divided by the change in   
the x coordinate as one moves along the line (and not by the actual measurements of the graph.)

In this graph, a change of one gray line in the x direction corresponds to a change of 1 in the [`x`]-direction corresonds to a change of 1 in the x coordinate, while a change of one gray line in the [`y`]-direction corresponds to a change of [$k/2] in the [`y`]-coordinate.

Two points that fall on integer coordinates are [`(0,[$y1])`] and [`([$a],[$y2])`]. The slope is the rise over the run or

[``` m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{[$k/2]}{[$a]} = \frac{[$rise]}{[$run]} ```]
