This table shows the results of polls taken during the four months
preceding an election between two candidates - [$p1] and [$p2].

[@ DataTable([['July', 'Aug.', 'Sept.', 'Oct.'],\@x],
  caption => "Percentage of Voters Choosing $p1",
  tablecss => 'width:50%;'); @]*

[$p2] published this graph in a newspaper.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
While all of the choices state facts that are correct, the one unusual thing that would not
be expected by the readers is that a line with negative slope would indicate increasing popularity.
A person who did not look carefully would assume that a negative slope would indicate decreasing
popularity. That is : the graph gives the impression that [$p1]'s popularity is decreasing.
