BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
One way to solve this problem is to divide out the four fractions.$BR  An easier way is to notice that if the numerator of a fraction is larger than half $BRof the
denominator then the fraction is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\)$BR and if the
numerator is less than half of the denominator than the fraction is less than  \(\frac{1}{2}\).$BR  Since 0.48 is less than  \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{6}{11}>\frac{1}{2}\) we know that$PAR \(\frac{6}{11}>0.48\)
