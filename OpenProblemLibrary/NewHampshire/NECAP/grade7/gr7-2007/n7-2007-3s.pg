IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NECAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR
THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR

Denise is building a fence around her 18-foot by 24-foot rectangular garden.

$BCENTER
\{ image( insertGraph($graph), tex_size=>300,
    height=>400, width=>500

$ECENTER
$PAR
She will $PAR
put a post at each corner $PAR
put some posts along the sides, and $PAR
space the posts equally arount the garden.

$PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}

END_TEXT
ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The spacing of the posts must be equal on all sides.$BR
  Thus the distance between the posts must divide both 18 and 24.$BR
The largest number that divides 18 and 24 (the g.c.f of 18 and 24) is 6.
