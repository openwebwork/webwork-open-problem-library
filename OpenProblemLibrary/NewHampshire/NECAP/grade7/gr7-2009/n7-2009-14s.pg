BEGIN_TEXT
A construction company must pay a fine for completing a job late.$BR
The company uses the equation below to calculate the amount of the fine \(f\) in dollars when the job is finished \(d\) days late.
\[f = $t,000+1,$h d.\]
The company completes a construction job \($days\) days late.$BR
The fine is ${DOLLAR}\{ans_rule(10)\}.

$ans = Currency("$base + $daily*$days");
ANS($ans->cmp(promoteReals=>1)); 
#Take out the promoteReals to require correct currency format
#in this case remove the ${DOLLAR} in the problem text above.
#With the way it's set up, the student may enter commas in their answer.


$mult = $daily*$days;
$raw_ans = $base + $mult;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Substitute \(d = $days\) in the equation: $BR
\($base + $daily \times $days = $base + $mult = $raw_ans\)
$BR $BR
So, the fine is $ans.
