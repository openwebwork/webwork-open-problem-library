Look at this number sentence: \(1400=2\times 2\times 2\times 5\times 5\times 7\). $BR
The number sentence is true.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The number sentence says 2 occurs as a factor in 1400 $BITALIC three $EITALIC times. Thus, because 2, 5, 7 are prime numbers,$BR
\(1400 \neq 2^2\times 5^1 \times 7^1\) and $BR
\(1400 \neq 2^2\times 5^1 \times 7^0\) $BR
so those two answers are wrong.  Also 7 occurs as a factor in 1400 $BITALIC once$EITALIC, therefore $BR
\(1400 \neq 2^3\times 5^2 \times 7^0\) $BR
so that answer also is wrong.  Finally, the number sentence says $BR
\(1400 = 2^3\times 5^2 \times 7^1\) $BR
so that answer is correct.  $PAR

By the way \(p^0=1\) whenever \(p\neq 0\), so the factor \(7^0\), which 
occurs in one of the expressions, contributes nothing to the product.  We could have just left it out.
