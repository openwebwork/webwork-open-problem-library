IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR
 
Look at this number sentence \(1400=2\times 2\times 2\times 5\times 5\times 7\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Since 2 occurs as a factor in 1400 three times, the expression begins \(2^3\).$BR
Since 5 occurs as a factor in 1400 twice, the expression continues \(5^2\).$BR 
Since 7 occurs as a factor in 1400 once, the expression begins \(7^1\).$BR
Since \(p^0\) (which is 1) means that prime p is not a factor of the number, it would make no $BR sense to put \(p^0\) into such an expression because there are
infinitely many primes that do not occur $BR in the factorization of any particular number.
