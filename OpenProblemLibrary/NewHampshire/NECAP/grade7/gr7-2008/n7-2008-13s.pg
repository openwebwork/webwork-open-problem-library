BEGIN_TEXT
A square is divided into two triangles by one of its diagonals.
$PAR

\{$radio->print_q()\}

$PAR

Another square is divided into two triangles by one of its diagonals.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
When a diagonal is drawn then each of the triangles has one of the right angles
of the square$BR
so that the two triangles will be right triangles.
$PAR
Each of the two triangles contain two sides of the square.  The hypotenuse is
longer than these sides$BR so the triangles are isoceles.
$PAR
ON THE NEAP EXAM, IN ADDITION TO ANSWERING THE TWO QUESTIONS ABOVE STUDENTS
WERE ASKED $BR TO EXPLAIN THEIR ANSWERS.  THE EXPLANATIONS ABOVE WOULD BE
APPROPRIATE THERE.
