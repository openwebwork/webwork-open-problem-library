BEGIN_TEXT
IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NECAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR
 THIS IS A NECAP PROBLEM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR 
Jenn is putting her wrenches away.  She is missing a wrench with a size $BR between \(\frac{5}{8}\) inch and \(\frac{3}{4}\) inch.$PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}

ANS(radio_cmp($radio->correct_ans()));
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
In order to compare, it is easiest to express each of the fractions$BR
over a common denominator, in this case, \(16\) would be easiest.$BR
\(\frac{5}{8}=\frac{10}{16}\),  \(\frac{3}{4}=\frac{12}{16}\),  \(\frac{1}{2}=\frac{8}{16}\), \(\frac{7}{8}=\frac{14}{16}\),   \(\frac{1}{2}=\frac{8}{16}\)$BR
Now it is easy to see that \(\frac{11}{16}\) fits between \(\frac{10}{16}\) and \(\frac{12}{16}\).
