BEGIN_PGML
Which measure describes a rate?

[_]{$rb}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

One dictionary definition of a rate is this:
A certain quantity or amount of one thing considered in relation to
 a unit of another thing and used as a standard or measure:
at the rate of 60 miles an hour.

Only "the amount of money earned per hour" satisfies this definition.
In the other answers thereis only one quantity.
