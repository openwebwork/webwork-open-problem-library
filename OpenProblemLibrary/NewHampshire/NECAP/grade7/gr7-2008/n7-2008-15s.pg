BEGIN_TEXT
The cost in dollars, for school groups to go to a museum can be calculated by$BR using the expression

$PAR
\(10t+5s\)$PAR
where \(t\) is the number of teachers and \(s\) is the number of students.
$PAR
a) Jamestown school has a group of 3 teachers and 40 students going to the museum.$BR
The cost in dollars, for the group from Jamestown School to go to the museum is $DOLLAR\{ans_rule(3)\}$PAR
b) The total cost for a group from Martinsburg School to go to the museum is ${DOLLAR}290.$BR  If there are 50 students in this group, then there are \{ans_rule(3)\} teachers.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) Substituting 3 for \(t\) and 40 for \(s\) into the expression we obtain \(10\times 3+5\times 40=230\).$PAR
b)  50 students will cost \(5\times 50=250\) dollars.$BR  The remaining $DOLLAR 40 will pay for 4 teachers since \(10\times 4=40\)$PAR
The problem had a third part which was difficult to present as a WeBWorK problem$BR This part asked you to show three different possible groups of teachers and
students$BR that would be charged exactly $DOLLAR 125 to go to the museum.  
$PAR If you think about it a bit, you could use any number from 0 to 12 for the
$BR teachers (although 12 teachers and 1 student might be a bit ridiculous and
$BR no teachers and 25 students might not have been expected as an answer). 

 
$PAR
IN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NECAP EXAM YOU WERE EXPECTED $BR
 TO SHOW YOUR WORK.  SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION $BR
 ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
