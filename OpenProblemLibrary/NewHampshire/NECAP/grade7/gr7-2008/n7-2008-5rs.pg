BEGIN_TEXT
IF YOU ARE PRACTICING FOR THE NEAP EXAMINATION, DO THIS WITHOUT A CALCULATOR $BR THIS IS A PROBLEM FROM FOR WHICH A CALCULATOR WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED.$PAR

Allen has a piece of rope that is $x inches long.  He cuts off one piece$BR
that is $y inches long and another piece that is $v inches long. $PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
If you are uncomfortable working with mixed numbers it is sometimes helpful
$BR to break things up. $PAR
$x-($y)-($v)=( $x-$y1-$v1)-$y2c-$v2c=$s1-($y2c+$v2c). $PAR
 Now look at the fractional part and take the two fractions over a common
denominator and add. $PAR
$y2c+$v2c=$y2cd+$v2c=$s2;
$PAR
Finally, subtract $s2 from $s1 to obtain the answer $p2.
