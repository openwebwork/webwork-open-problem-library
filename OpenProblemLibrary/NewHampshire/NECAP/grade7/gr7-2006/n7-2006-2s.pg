BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
An equiangular triangle has three \(60^\circ\) angles and sides of equal length.$BR Therefore it can't be a right triangle (which has a \(90^\circ\) angle) or  $BR a scalene triangle (which has sides of unequal length).  The correct answer is $BR acute, equilateral.
