BEGIN_PGML
[$p] has a photograph that is [$w] inches wide and [$h] inches tall.

a) [$p->They] [$p->verb('enlarge')] the photograph proportionally so that it is [@ $w*$factor @] inches wide.
So it must be [_]{Real($factor*$h)} inches tall.

b) Can [$p] enlarge the photograph proportionally to [@2*$w@] inches by [@ 2*$h-2 @] inches?  [_]{$dd}


END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) Note that the the photograph is enlarged by a factor of [`` \frac{[@$factor*$w@]\;\text{inches}}{[$w]\;\text{inches}} = [$factor]``].  Therefore the height of the enlargement would be [`[$factor] \cdot [$h] =  [@ $factor*$h @]`] inches. 

b) If the width is to be enlarged to [@ 2*$w @] inches, which is double the width, then the height would also need to be doubled, however [` [@ 2*$h-2 @] \neq 2 \cdot [$h]`].  So it is impossible to enlarge the photograph proportionally to [@2*$w@] inches by [@ 2*$h-2 @] inches.

ON THE NEAP EXAMINATION YOU WERE ASKED TO EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO b. 

SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION ABOVE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR FULL CREDIT.
