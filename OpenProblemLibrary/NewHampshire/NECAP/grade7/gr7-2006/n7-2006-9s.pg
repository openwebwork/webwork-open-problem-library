Aaron's goal is to read an average (mean) of 26 pages per day for 6 days.$BR
During the first 5 days he reads 23 pages per day$PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The easiest way to think of this problem is this.  Aaron must read 26 pages (hisdaily quota)$BR plus the number of pages he should have read but did not read on the first five days.$BR Since he averaged 23 pages per day he is missing 3 pages per day or 15 pages (which he should have read).$BR  Thus, he must read 26+15=41 pages on the 6th day.
