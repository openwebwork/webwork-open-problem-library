$PAR
Ms. Heron gave her son and grandchildren 12 acres of farmland.  She have her son half of the 12 acres.  She split the rest equally among the 3 grandchildren.$PAR
a) She gave each grandchild \{ans_rule(2)\} acres. $PAR
b) The fraction of the farm that she gave each grandchild  \{ans_rule(3)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
a) She gave her son half of the twelve acres (that is, 6 acres). This left
6 acres $BR for the 3 grandchildren.  So each got \(\frac {1}{3} \) of 6 acres,
which is 2 acres.
b) 2 acres is \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) of the farm.
