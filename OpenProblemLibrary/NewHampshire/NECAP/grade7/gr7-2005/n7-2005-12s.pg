BEGIN_TEXT
The manager of a restaurant uses the formula below to decide what to charge for a meal.$PAR
\[p=(f\div 3)\times 10\]
In the formula, \(p\) is the price, in dollars. that customers pay for a meal and$BR
\(f\) is the food cost to make the meal.$PAR
If the food cost is $cost then the price of the meal is ${DOLLAR}\{ans_rule(3)\}.
END_TEXT

ANS($mealPrice->cmp(promoteReals=>1)); 
#Take out the promoteReals to require correct currency format
#in this case remove the ${DOLLAR} in the problem text above.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Just substitute $foodCost for \(f\) to get the equation \(p=($foodCost\div 3)\times 10\).
$BR This gives a meal price of $mealPrice.
END_SOLUTION
