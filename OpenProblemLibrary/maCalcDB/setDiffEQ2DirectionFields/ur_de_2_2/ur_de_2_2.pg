# parts of the matching question have been answered correctly and which are
# incorrect.  That is too easy.  To accomplish this we set the following flag to zero.

# Make a new select list

$tf = new_match_list();
# $tf now "contains" the select list object. 


# use pop-up list instead of an answer rule.


# What should the pop-up list say, and what should it submit for an answer when selected?
# These are specified in the statment below.
# To enter T as an answer choose the list element "True"
# To enter F as an answer choose the list element "False"
# The first choice is a blank to make the students do SOMETHING!!!

# Note how the list is constructed [ answer => list element , answer => list element ]

# Insert some  questions and whether or not they are true.
