$NN = int(log($AA)/log(1.001));

BEGIN_TEXT
This problem is a reprise of problem 5 with 1.1 replaced by 1.001
$PAR
Compute an approximation to
\[\int_1^{$AA}\frac{1}{x}\,dx\,,\]
which gives the area under \(y=\frac{1}{x}\) for \(1\le x\le $AA\), using
a modified Riemann sum with the (NOT equally spaced) partition
\[1,1.001,1.001^2,1.001^3,\dots,1.001^N,$AA\]
and left hand endpoints EXCEPT neglecting the area of the
last rectangle. Here \(N\) denotes the largest possible power which fits in the
interval \(1\le x\le $AA\).

$PAR
Please note that the problem is NOT asking for the value of \(\int_1^{$AA}\frac{1}{x}\,dx\).
Rather it is asking for the EXACT values of the areas of approximating rectangles
and for the EXACT value of the sum of the areas of the rectangles. Calculator
approximations (no matter how accurate) will NOT be accepted. Do the calculations
by hand using fractions (until you notice the pattern in the areas).
$PAR

The number of approximating rectangles is:
$BR
\(N\)  =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

The area of the first rectangle  =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
The area of the second rectangle  =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
The area of the third rectangle  =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

The sum of the areas of the \(N\) rectangles  =  \{ ans_rule()\}
