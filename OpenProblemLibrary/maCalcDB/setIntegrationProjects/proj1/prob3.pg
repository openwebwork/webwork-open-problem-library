$PAR
Consider the graph from Part 2 of the problem.
The approximate graph of  \(y=F'(x)\) looks like the graph of \(y=\sin($AA x^2)\)
shifted  \{ ans_rule()\} units right. (Use a minus sign if the graph is shifted left.)
$BR
CLUES: Compare the column containing approximate values of F'(x) in Table 3 with
various columns in Tables 1 and 2 (Table 1 is easier). You should be able to
find a close match. Then note that this column (in Table 1 or 2) is obtained by
applying the function \(\sin($AA x^2)\) not to the \(x\)-values (which are in
column A) but to \(x\) values with a shift.

BEGIN_TEXT
It is perfectly kosher to work on this project in groups, as long as each individual submits
their own work for their own individual version of the problem.  Do not hesitate to seek
help from your lecturer or TA, if you don't understand the mathematics or if you have technical difficulties
with the spreadsheet.
$PAR
EXTRA BONUS PROBLEM: You can improve the accuracy of the above calculations (especially the second graph,
also extending the range of \(x\) values to a bigger interval than \(-4\le x\le 4\)) by
using a smaller step size than 0.1. Redo the entire problem using a smaller step size
and explaining what you think is going on. (Be sure to explain what you think the value of the shift will be for this smaller step size.) Hand in the
results separately writing your name and BONUS PROJECT 1 on the cover sheet. (You still have to hand
in the regular Project 1.)  To conserve paper, print out just the first two pages of Tables 1, 2 and 3.
If you do this correctly, you will get 10 more bonus points added to your course total, after the grading
curve for the class has been constructed.
