BEGIN_TEXT
Students in a fifth-grade class were given an exam.  During the next 2 years,
the same students were retested several times.  The average score was given by
the model
\[ f(t) = $a - $b \log_{10}(t+1), \qquad 0\leq t\leq 24 \]
where \(t\) is the time in months.
$PAR
(a) What is the average score on the original exam?
$BR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
(b) What was the average score after 6 months?
$BR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
(c) What was the average score after 18 months?
$BR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
