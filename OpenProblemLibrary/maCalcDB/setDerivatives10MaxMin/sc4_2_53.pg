TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A University of Rochester student decided to depart from Earth after his
graduation to find work on Mars.  Before building a shuttle, he conducted careful
calculations.  A model for the velocity of the shuttle, from liftoff at t = $t0
s until the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned at t = $t1 s, is given by
\[ v(t) = $av t^3- \{$b1/2\} t^2 + $c t ? {$d}  \]
(in feet per second).  Using this model, estimate $BR
the absolute maximum value \{ANS_RULE(1,20) \}$BR
and absolute minimum value \{ANS_RULE(2,20) \} $BR
of the $BBOLD ACCELERATION $EBOLD of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the
boosters.
