A bag contains $red red marbles, $white white marbles, and $blue blue marbles.
You draw $draw marbles out at random, without replacement.  
What is the probability that all the marbles are red? 
$BR  $BR 
The probability that all the marbles are red is \{ans_rule(10)\}. 
$BR
$BR
What is the probability that exactly two of the marbles are red?
$BR
The probability that exactly two of the marbles are red is \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$BR
$BR
What is the probability that none of the marbles are red?
$BR
The probability of picking no red marbles is \{ans_rule(10)\}.
