BEGIN_TEXT
A tank contains \($y0\) kg of salt and \($w\) L of water. Pure water enters a tank at the rate \($ri\) L/min. The
solution is mixed and drains from the tank at the rate
\($ro\) L/min.

(a) What is the amount of salt in the tank initially? $BR
	amount = \{ans_rule(20) \} (kg) $BR
$BR 
(b) Find the amount of salt in the tank after $t hours. $BR
	amount =  \{ ans_rule(20) \} (kg) $BR 
$BR 
(c) Find the concentration of salt in the solution in the tank as time approaches infinity. (Assume your tank 
is large enough to hold all the solution.) $BR
