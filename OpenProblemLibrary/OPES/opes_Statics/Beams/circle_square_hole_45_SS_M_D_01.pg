$BBOLD$BITALIC Problem Statement: $EBOLD$EITALIC$BR
Member AB spans two supports that are a = $a m apart. It is subjected to a distributed load of w = $w N/m and a concentrated moment of M = $M N*m as shown. The member will have a square $c mm\(\times\)$c mm hole in its cross-section, oriented at a 45 degree angle as shown. If the material that composes the member must not be stressed above $sigma_allowable MPa, find the minimum allowable outer diameter of the member, $BITALIC b$EITALIC. (Neglect the shearing stresses in the member.)
