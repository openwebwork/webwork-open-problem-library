$BBOLD$BITALIC Problem Statement: $EBOLD$EITALIC$BR
A wooden deck is constructed to support a haystack as shown. The joists of the floor are to be made with dressed air-dry douglas fir lumber with nominal widths of 2 inches. You know that a 14"x18"x36" square bale of this kind of hay weighs $w1 lb, and you are assuming the hay in the haystack has the same density as these square bales. (This is probably a conservative estimate, since the bales are probably denser than the stack in reality.) You would like to design the joists to have a factor of safety of $FS against yielding. Determine the following:
 $PAR
(a) The maximum value of the distributed load applied to one joist.$BR
(b) The maximum bending moment experienced by one joist.$BR
(c) The minimum required height $BITALIC h $EITALIC of the joists.$BR
(d) The minimum required section modulus of the joists.$BR
(e) The smallest standard lumber size acceptable to use for joists.
$PAR
$BBOLD$BITALIC Answers: $EBOLD$EITALIC$BR
(a) \(w_{max}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(b) \(M_{max}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(c) \(h_{min}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(d) \(S_{min}\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(e) Lumber Choice = \{pop_up_list([@joists])\}
