tractor tree 01
$PAR
A farmer's tractor has gotten stuck in a muddy pasture. To try to free the tractor, the farmer ties a rope to a tree and the front of her tractor, then pulls sideways in the middle of the rope with a force of F = $F N. Angles of \(\theta\) = $theta degrees are formed as shown. Find the x and y components of the force applied to the front of the tractor by the rope in this position.
