hanging crate 01
$PAR

A crate is hung by ropes attached to a steel ring. Assume that the center of gravity (CG) of the crate shown lies at its geometric center, and that ring A lies directly above the crate's CG. The top surface of the crate is horizontal, and ring A lies $h inches above it. Other dimensions are given as:
$PAR
a = $a in $BR
b = $b in $BR
c = $c in 
$PAR
A load cell measures the tension in rope AC to be \(T_{AC}\) = $TAC lb. Find the weight of the crate and the tension in the other two ropes.
