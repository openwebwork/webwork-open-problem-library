suspended cylinder 01
$PAR
A cylinder suspended by a rope rests against an inclined surface as shown. If the cylinder weighs $W N, \(\theta\) = $theta degrees and \(\phi\) = $phi degrees, find the tension in the rope (above the knot) and the normal force between the cylinder and the inclined surface.
