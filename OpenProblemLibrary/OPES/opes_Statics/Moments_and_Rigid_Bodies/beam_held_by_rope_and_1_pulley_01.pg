$PAR
Beam ABC has a mass of $M1 kg, centered at the middle of the beam (not necessarily point B). The winch at C has a mass of $M2 kg. A rope attaches at B and passes over a frictionless, small-diameter pulley at D. The rope is taken up by the winch, which lies directly below the pulley in the position shown (i.e. rope segment CD is vertical). Find the tension in the rope and the magnitude and direction of the reaction force at A, given the dimensions shown below.
