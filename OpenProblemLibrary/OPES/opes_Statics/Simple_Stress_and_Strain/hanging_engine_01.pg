hanging engine 01
$PAR
Two ropes are used to hoist a $W lb engine/transmission assembly as shown. The rope is anchored at C around the center part of the pin shown, causing the pin to experience a state of double shear. There is a frictionless pulley at A. The normal stress in the rope must not be allowed to exceed $NSrope ksi, and the shearing stress in the pin must not exceed $SSpin ksi. When the hoist is in the position given by:
$PAR
a = $a in $BR
b = $b ft $BR
c = $c ft
$PAR
find the following: $PAR
(a & b) The forces carried in ropes AB and BC $BR
(c & d) The necessary diameters of ropes AB and BC $BR
(e) The necessary diameter of the pin at C
$PAR
\{ image("hanging_engine_01.png", width=>412, height=>161, tex_size=>600) \}

$PAR
(a) \(T_{AB}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(b) \(T_{BC}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
(c) \(d_{AB}\) = \{ ans_rule(10)\}
