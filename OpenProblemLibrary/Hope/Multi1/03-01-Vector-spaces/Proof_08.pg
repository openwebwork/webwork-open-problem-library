$definition
Recall that one of the ten parts of the definition of a vector space says that 
if \( V \) is a vector space, then there exists a vector \( $zero \) in \( V \) 
such that \( $zero + $x = $x \) for all \( $x \) in \( V \).

$statement
Let \( V \) be any vector space.
Prove that if \( $zero \) is a zero vector of \( V \), then \( $x + $zero = $x \) for all \( $x \) in \( V \).

$proof
Suppose for full generality that \( V \) is any vector space and \( $x \) is any vector in \( V \).
Suppose \( $zero \) is any zero vector of \( V \).
Show that \( $x + $zero = $x \). 
By the definition of a vector space, since \( $zero \) is a zero vector, \{ $ans1->ans_rule(35) \}.
Since \{ $ans2->ans_rule(35) \}, we can interchange the order of addition and obtain \{ $ans3->ans_rule(35) \}.
Since \( $x \) was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that \( $x + $zero = $x \) for all \( $x \) in \( V \). \( \Box \)
