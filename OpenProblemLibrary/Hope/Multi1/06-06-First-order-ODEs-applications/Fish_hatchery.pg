BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose the population \( P \) of rainbow trout in a fish hatchery is modeled by 
the differential equation \[ \frac{dP}{dt} = P ($M - P), \] where \( P \) is
measured in thousands of trout and \( t \) is measured in years.
Suppose \( P(0) = $P0 \).
$BR
$BR
(a) How many trout are initially in the hatchery?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} trout.
$BR
$BR
(b) Find a formula for the population at any time.
$BR
\( P(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \} thousands of trout.
$BR
$BR
(c) What is the size of the trout population after a very long time?
$BR
\( \displaystyle \lim_{t \to \infty} P(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} thousands of trout.
$BR
$BR
(d) At what time is the trout population increasing most rapidly?
$BR
\( t = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} years.
