BEGIN_TEXT
The trace of a square \( n \times n \) matrix \( A = (a_{ij}) \) is 
the sum \( a_{11} + a_{22} + \cdots + a_{nn} \) of the entries on 
its main diagonal.

$BR
Let \( V \) be the vector space of all \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices with real entries.  
Let \( H \) be the set of all \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices with real entries that have trace \( 0 \).
Is \( H \) a subspace of the vector space \( V \)?
$BR
$BR \{ BeginList('OL') \}
$ITEM Is \( H \) nonempty? $BR \{ $zero->menu() \}
$ITEMSEP
$ITEM Is \( H \) closed under addition?  If it is, enter ${BITALIC}CLOSED${EITALIC}.
If it is not, enter two matrices in \( H \) whose sum is not in \( H \), 
using a comma separated list and syntax such as \( \verb+[[1,2],[3,4]], [[5,6],[7,8]]+ \)
for the answer \(\{Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])\},\{Matrix([[5,6],[7,8]])\}\).
(Hint: to show that \( H \) is not closed under addition, it is sufficient to find two trace zero
matrices \( A \) and \( B \) such that \( A+B \) has nonzero trace.)
$BR \{ $list1->ans_rule(30) \}
$ITEMSEP
$ITEM Is \( H \) closed under scalar multiplication?  If it is, enter ${BITALIC}CLOSED${EITALIC}.
If it is not, enter a scalar in \( \mathbb{R} \) and a matrix in \( H \) whose product is not in \( H \),
using a comma separated list and syntax such as \( \verb+2, [[3,4],[5,6]]+ \) for the
answer \( 2, \{Matrix([[3,4],[5,6]])\} \).
(Hint: to show that \( H \) is not closed under scalar multiplication, it is sufficient to find a real number
\( r \) and a trace zero matrix \( A \) such that \( rA \) has nonzero trace.)
$BR \{ $list2->ans_rule(30) \}
$ITEMSEP
$ITEM Is \( H \) a subspace of the vector space \( V \)? 
You should be able to justify your answer by writing a complete, coherent, and detailed proof 
based on your answers to parts 1-3.
