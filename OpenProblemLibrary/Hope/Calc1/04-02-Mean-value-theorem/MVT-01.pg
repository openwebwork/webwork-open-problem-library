BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose \( f(x) = $f \).  In this problem, we will show that \( f \) has 
exactly one root (or zero) in the interval \( $closed \).
$BR
$BR
(a) First, we show that \( f \) has a root in the interval \( $open \).
Since \( f \) is a \{ $popup1->menu() \} function on the 
interval \( \lbrack $a, $b \rbrack \) and 
\( f($a) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} and 
\( f($b) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}, 
the graph of \( y = f(x) \) must cross the \(x\)-axis 
at some point in the interval \( $open \) by the
\{ $popup2->menu() \}.
Thus, \( f \) has at least one root in the interval 
\( $closed \).
$BR
$BR
(b) Second, we show that \( f \) cannot have more than one
root in the interval \( $closed \) by a thought experiment.
Suppose that there were two roots \( x = a \) and 
\( x = b \) in the interval \( $closed \) with \( a < b \).  Then
\( f(a) = f(b) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
Since \( f \) is 
\{ $popup3->menu() \} on the interval \( $closed \) and
\{ $popup4->menu() \} on the interval \( $open \), 
by \{ $popup5->menu() \}
there would exist a point \( c \) in interval \( (a,b) \)
so that \( f'(c) = 0 \).
However, the only solution to \( f'(x) = 0 \) is 
\( x = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}, which is not 
in the interval \( (a,b) \), or in \( $closed \).
Thus, \( f \) cannot have more than one root in \( $closed \).
