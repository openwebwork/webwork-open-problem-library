#  Solution

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
${BBOLD}A.${EBOLD} True since both \(f\) and \(g\) are given by the same rule, and are defined on the same domain, hence they are the same function.
$BR
${BBOLD}B.${EBOLD} False since \(f\) and \(g\) are the same function.
$BR
${BBOLD}C.${EBOLD} False since complete information is given for 
\(f\) and \(g\).
