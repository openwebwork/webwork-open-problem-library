$ITEM Watch the YouTube video ${BITALIC}Math modeling of oil spills - ICIAM2011.${EITALIC}  \{ htmlLink("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU0EIIY_Uq0","(Link to video.)", "TARGET='_blank'" ) \}  Write a paragraph that reflects on what you have learned from this video and from the article that you found using ScienceDaily.com.  Your paragraph should be long (aim for at least 7 - 10 sentences) and should be written using formal English with correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  Do not plagiarize the work of others (I am interested in your writing ability!).  I would like you (the writer) to convince me that that what you have learned is important.  Also, you should try to persuade me to fund more research in this area.
