BEGIN_TEXT
The graph below shows the position of a car (in miles from Gackle, ND) as a function of time (in minutes). $PAR
\{ image( "preview_1_5.png", width=>319, height=>338,  
tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Graph of position versus time."' ) \}

$PAR
Find the slope of the line between the points \((57, 63.8)\) and \((104, 106.8)\). Include units in your answer.
$BR
Slope =
\{ ans_rule(25) \}.

Here is a list of \{ helpLink('units') \} that WeBWorK understands.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The slope is the change in \(s\) divided by the change in \(t\): 
\[\frac{106.8-63.8}{104-57} \approx $slope .\]
The slope between two points on a function
is the average rate of change of the function. Since \(s\) is a position
function, the slope represents the average velocity
on the time interval \([57,104]\).
