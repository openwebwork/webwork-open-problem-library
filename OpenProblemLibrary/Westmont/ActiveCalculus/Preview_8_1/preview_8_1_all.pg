BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you receive 5000 dollars through an inheritance. You decide
to invest this money into a fund that pays 8 percent annually, compounded monthly. That
means that each month your investment earns \(\frac{0.08}{12} P \) additional dollars, where \(P\) is your
principal balance at the start of the month. So in the first month your investment earns
\[ 5000 \left( \frac{0.08}{12}\right) \]
or 33.33 dollars. If you reinvest this money, you will then have 5033.33 dollars in your account at the
end of the first month. From this point on, assume that you reinvest all of the interest you
earn. $PAR

$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD How much interest will you earn in the second month? $BR
Interest earned = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars $BR
How much money will you have in your account at the end of the second month? $BR
Balance at end of second month = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars $PAR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD Repeat the calculations in part (a) to compute the interest earned and the end-of-month balances for months 3, 4, and 5. $BR
Interest earned in month 3 = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars. $BR Balance at end of month 3 = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars.
$PAR
Interest earned in month 4 = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars. $BR Balance at end of month 4 = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars.
$PAR
Interest earned in month 5 = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars. $BR  Balance at end of month 5 = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars.
$PAR
  
$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD As we will see later, the amount of money \(P_n\) in the account after month \(n\) is given by 
\[ P_n = 5000 \left( 1 + \frac{0.08}{12}\right)^n. \]
Use this formula to check your calculations in part (b). Then find the amount of
money in the account after 5 years. $BR
Balance at end of 5 years = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
To obtain the next month's interest, multiply the previous month's balance by \(0.08/12\). Then add this number to the previous month's balance to obtain the next month's ending balance. (Or use the formula in part (c).)
