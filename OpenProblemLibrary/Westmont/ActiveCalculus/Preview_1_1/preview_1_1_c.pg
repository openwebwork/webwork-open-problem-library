BEGIN_TEXT
The height \( s \) of a ball (in feet) at time \( t \) (in seconds) is
given by the formula \( s(t) = 64 - 16(t - 1)^2 \).  Consider the following 
expression.
\[ AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{s(1)-s(0.5)}{1-0.5} \]

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The expression for \(AV_{[0.5,1]} \) is called a $BITALIC difference quotient $EITALIC. 
Difference quotients compute the slope between two points on the graph of a function.
They also compute the average rate of change of a function on an interval, so if the function
measures the position of an object, the difference quotient measures the average
velocity. The average velocity of the ball on the interval \( 0.5 \leq t \leq 1 \) is $dq feet per second.
