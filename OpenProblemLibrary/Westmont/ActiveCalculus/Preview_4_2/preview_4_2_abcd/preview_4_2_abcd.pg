BEGIN_TEXT
A person walking along a straight path has her velocity in miles
per hour at time \(t\) given by the function \(v(t) = 0.25t^3 âˆ’ 1.5t^2 + 3t +
0.25\), for times in the
interval \(0 \leq t \leq 2\).
The graph of this function is also given in each of the three diagrams below.
$PAR
\{ image( "preview_4_2.png", width=>773, height=>330,  
tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Three ways to compute area."' ) \}
$PAR
Note that in each diagram, we use four rectangles to estimate the area under
\(y = v(t)\) on the interval \([0, 2]\), but the method by which the four
rectangles' respective
heights are decided varies among the three individual graphs. $PAR

Think about how the heights of the rectangles in the left-most diagram are
being chosen. Determine the value of
\(S=A_1+A_2+A_3+A_4\) by evaluating the function \(y=v(t)\) at
appropriately-chosen values and observing the width of each rectangle. Note,
for example, that \(A_3 = v(1)\cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2\cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1\). $BR
\(S = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \} 
$PAR

Use the rectangles in the middle diagram to find the value of
\(T=B_1+B_2+B_3+B_4\). $BR
\(T = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \} 
$PAR

Use the rectangles in the right-most diagram to find the value of
\(U=C_1+C_2+C_3+C_4\). $BR
\(U = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \} 
$PAR
Which estimate do you think is the best approximation of \(D\), the total
distance the person traveled on \([0,2]\)? Why?

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
\(S = (0.5)v(0)+(0.5)v(0.5)+(0.5)v(1)+(0.5)v(1.5) = $S\) $BR
\(T = (0.5)v(0.5)+(0.5)v(1)+(0.5)v(1.5)+(0.5)v(2) = $T\) $BR
\(U = (0.5)v(0.25)+(0.5)v(0.75)+(0.5)v(1.25)+(0.5)v(1.75) = $U\) $BR $BR
The total distance \(D\) should equal the area under the curve.
The best approximation is given by \(U\), because each rectangle has some area
above the curve to balance out the area that is missing below the curve. All of
the rectangles of \(S\) fall below the curve, while those of \(T\) all go above
the curve.
