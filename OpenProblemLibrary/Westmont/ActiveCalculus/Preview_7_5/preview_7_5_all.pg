$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD Suppose you have a bank account in which money grows at an annual rate of 3 percent. $PAR

If you have 10,000 dollars in the account, at what rate is your money growing? $BR
Rate of change = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars/year $PAR

Suppose that you are also withdrawing money from the account at $1,000 per year. What is the net rate of change in the amount of money in the account? $BR
Rate of change = \{ans_rule(10)\} dollars/year $PAR
$PAR

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD Suppose that a water tank contains 100 gallons of salt water and that a salty solution, which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon, enters the tank at 2 gallons per minute. $PAR

How much salt enters the tank each minute? $BR
Rate of salt entering = \{ans_rule(10)\} grams/minute $PAR

Suppose that initially there are 300 grams of salt in the tank. How much salt is in each gallon at this point in time? $BR
Concentration of salt = \{ans_rule(10)\} grams/gallon $PAR

Finally, suppose that evenly mixed solution is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 2 gallons per minute. At what rate is the salt leaving the tank? $BR
Rate of salt leaving = \{ans_rule(10)\} grams/minute $PAR

What is the net rate of change in the amount of salt in the tank? $BR
Rate of change = \{ans_rule(10)\} grams/minute $PAR

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
In each part, the net rate of change is the difference of the rate of increase (due to one phenomenon) minus the rate of decrease (due to another). In the first example, interest is causing the amount of money to increase, while withdrawals are causing it to decrease. In the second, the salt being pumped in causes the amount of salt to increase, while the solution being pumped out causes it to decrease. Notice that when calculating this difference, it is important for the units to be the same for both rates.
