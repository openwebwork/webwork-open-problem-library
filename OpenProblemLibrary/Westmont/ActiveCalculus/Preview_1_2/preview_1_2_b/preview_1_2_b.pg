BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that \(g\) is the function given by the graph below. Use the graph to
fill in the blanks in the following sentences.
$PAR
\{ image( "preview_1_2.png", width=>369, height=>337,  
tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Graph of a function."' ) \}

$PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(-1\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(0\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(2\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$PAR

BEGIN_HINT
For these questions, consider only the function values $BITALIC near $EITALIC the given
\(x\)-values, not the function values $BITALIC at $EITALIC the given \(x\)-values.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(-1\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \($ansLimn1\), because the function in this neighborhood is a continuous
curve that passes through the point \((-1,3)\).
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(0\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \($ansLim0\), because the values of the function on both sides of \(x=0\)
are approaching \($ansLim0\), even though the value of \(g(0)\) is different. 
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(2\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \($ansLim2\), because the values of the function on both sides of \(x=2\)
are approaching \($ansLim2\), even though the value of \(g(2)\) is undefined.
