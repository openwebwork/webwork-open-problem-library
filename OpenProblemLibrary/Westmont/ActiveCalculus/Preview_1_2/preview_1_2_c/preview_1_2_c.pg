BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that \(g\) is the function given by the graph below. Use the graph to
fill in the blanks in the following sentences.
$PAR
\{ image( "preview_1_2.png", width=>369, height=>337,  
tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Graph of a function."' ) \}

$PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer to (but stays less than)  \(1\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer to (but stays greater than)  \(1\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \{ ans_rule(5) \}.
$PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(1\), does \(g(x)\) get as close
as we want to a single value? If such a value exists, enter it. If no such value exists,
enter DNE. $BR
\(x = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \}.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
As \(x\) gets closer and closer to (but stays less than)  \(1\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \($ansLimleft\) (follow the curve on the left side of \(x=1\)). 
As \(x\) gets closer and closer to (but stays greater than)  \(1\), \(g(x)\) gets as close
as we want to \($ansLimright\) (follow the curve on the right side of \(x=1\)). 
Therefore, as \(x\) gets closer and closer (but not equal) to \(1\), \(g(x)\) does not
get as close as we want to a single value.
