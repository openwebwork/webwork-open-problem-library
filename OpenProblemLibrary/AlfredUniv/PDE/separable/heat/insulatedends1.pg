For the general solution of the differential equation in the following cases use a and b for your constants and list the functions in alphabetical order, for example \(y = a\cos (x) + b \sin(x)\). For the variable \(\lambda\) type the word lambda, for \(\alpha\) type alpha, otherwise treat these as you would any other variable.
$BR
$BR
$BR
Solve the heat equation 
\[
\begin{aligned}
&k\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, 0< x < L, t > 0\\
&\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0,t) = 0, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(L,t) = 0, t > 0\\
&u(x,0) = 
\begin{cases}
$f1, &0 < x < \frac{L}{2}\\
$f2, &\frac{L}{2}<x<L\\
\end{cases}\\
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR
This models the heat equation in a long thin rod with insulated ends. Since we have not solved this boundary value problem, we have to start from scratch
$BR
We look for solutions of the form \(u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\). 
$BR
The PDE can be rewritten using this solution as (placing constants in the DE for T) into 
$BR
\{$Xdiff1->ans_rule\} = \{$Tdiff1->ans_rule\} = \(-\lambda\)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of \(X\) is written as \(X^\prime\). Do NOT use \(X^\prime(x)\)
$BR
The boundary conditions in the PDE translate into initial conditions for the differential equation in X:
$BR

Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated 
$BR
DE in X: \{$Xdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR IC's in X: 
$BR
$BCENTER
\(X^\prime(\)\{$multians->ans_rule(1)\}\() = \)\{$multians->ans_rule(1)\}
$BR
\(X^\prime(\)\{$multians->ans_rule(1)\}\() = \)\{$multians->ans_rule(1)\}
$ECENTER
$BR
DE in T: \{$Tdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
$BR
This leads us to a Sturm-Louiville problem. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants a and b and the general solution in Y is written with constants c and d.
$BR
$BBOLD Case 1: $EBOLD \(\lambda = 0\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xequal->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
Using this formula
$BR
$BCENTER
\(X^\prime(0) = \)\{ans_rule(1)\} \( = 0\)
$BR
\(X^\prime(L) = \)\{ans_rule(1)\} \( = 0\)
$ECENTER
$BR
Making X a constant function. We get the constant solution another way, so we will discard this case.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Case 2: $EBOLD \(\lambda = -\alpha^2\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xless->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(X^\prime(0) = \)\{ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
That simplifies X down to \{ans_rule\}. Using the simplified X:
$BR
\(X^\prime(L) = \)\{ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
Therefore \(a = \) \{ans_rule\} and
$BR
$BR
\(X = \) \{ans_rule\}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Case 3: $EBOLD \(\lambda = \alpha^2 \)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xgreater->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(X^\prime(0) = \)\{ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
So X simplifies to \{$Xcos->ans_rule\}. Using the simplified X:
$BR
\(X^\prime(L) = \)\{ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
Which leads us to the eigenvalues \(\alpha =\)\{ans_rule\}
$BR 
$BBOLD Note $EBOLD n = 0 is the constant from above, including it would have been redundant.
$BR
Since this case has nontrivial solutions we now solve the differential equation in T using c as the constant: 
$BR
\(T = \) \{$Tgreater->ans_rule\}
$BR
So for each n the product \(u = XT = \)\{$un->ans_rule(30)\} (without constants)is a solution of the PDE with boundary conditions: 
$BR
\[
\begin{aligned}
&k\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, 0< x < L, t > 0\\
&\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0,t) = 0, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(L,t) = 0, t > 0\\
\end{aligned}
\]
$BR
$BR
To get the initial conditions we need a series solution of the form
$BR
\(u(x,t)=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty A_n\)\{$un->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
\(u(x,0)=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty A_n\)\{$cn->ans_rule(30)\}\( = \begin{cases}
$f1, &0 < x < \frac{L}{2}\\
$f2, &\frac{L}{2}<x<L\\
\end{cases}\)
$BR
which we recognize as a Fourier series:
$BR 
\(
\begin{aligned}
A_n&=\frac{2}{L}\int_0^{\frac{L}{2}}\mbox{\{ans_rule(30)\}}\hskip 3pt dx
&\\
&=\mbox{\{ans_rule(30)\}}\\
\end{aligned}
\)
