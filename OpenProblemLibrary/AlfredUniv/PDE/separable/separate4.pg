BEGIN_TEXT
\(\lambda\) is typed as lambda, \(\alpha\) as alpha.
$BR
$BR
$PAR
The PDE \[k^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=y^$n\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\]
is separable, so we look for solutions of the form \(u(x,t) = X(x)Y(y)\).  When solving DE in X and Y use the constants a and b for X and c for Y.
$BR
The PDE can be rewritten using this solution as (placing constants in the DE for Y) into 
$BR
\{$Xdiff1->ans_rule\} = \{$Ydiff1->ans_rule\} = \(-\lambda\)
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of \(X\) is written as \(X^\prime\). Do NOT use \(X^\prime(x)\)
$BR
$BR
Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated 
$BR
DE in X: \{$Xdiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
DE in Y: \{$Ydiff2->ans_rule\} \( = 0\)
$BR
$BR
Now we solve the separate separated ODEs for the different cases in \(\lambda\). In each case the general solution in X is written with constants a and b and the general solution in Y is written with constants c and d. Write the functions alphabetically, so that if the solutions involve cos and sin, your answer would be acos(x) + bsin(x).
$BR
$BBOLD Case 1: $EBOLD \(\lambda = 0\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xequal->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
\(Y(y) = \) \{$Yequal->ans_rule(70)\}

$BR
$BBOLD DE in Y $EBOLD
$BR
If \(\lambda\neq 0\), the differential equation in Y is first order, linear, and more importantly separable. We separate the two sides as
$BR
\{$left->ans_rule\} = \{$right->ans_rule\}
$BR
Integrating both sides with respect to \(y\) (placing the constant of integration c in the right hand side) we get
\{$left->ans_rule\} = \{$right->ans_rule\}
$BR
Solving for Y, using the funny algebra of constant where \(e^c =c\) is just another constant we get
$BR
\(Y = \) \{$Y->ans_rule(25)\}
$BR
$BR
For \(\lambda\neq 0\) we get a Sturm-Louiville problem in X which we need to handle two more cases
$BR
$BBOLD Case 2: $EBOLD \(\lambda = -\alpha^2\)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xless->ans_rule(70)\}

$BR
$BBOLD Case 3: $EBOLD \(\lambda = \alpha^2 \)
$BR
\(X(x) = \) \{$Xgreater->ans_rule(70)\}

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Final Solution $EBOLD
$BR
$BBOLD Case 1: $EBOLD \(\lambda = 0\)
$BR
\(u = \) \{$uequal->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
$BBOLD Case 2: $EBOLD \(\lambda = -\alpha^2\)
$BR
\(u = \) \{$uless->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
$BBOLD Case 3: $EBOLD \(\lambda = \alpha^2 \)
$BR
\(u = \) \{$ugreater->ans_rule(70)\}
