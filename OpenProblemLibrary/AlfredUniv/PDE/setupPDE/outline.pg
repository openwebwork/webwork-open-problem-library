BEGIN_TEXT
In this assignment you will be asked to input PDE's, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. In order to get WeBWorK to understand your answers you are going to have to format your answers in a particular way, which is spelled out here.
$BR
$BBOLD Entering Partial Derivatives $EBOLD
$BR

\{ begintable(2) \}
\{ row("Partial Derivative","Enter into WeBWork") \}
\{ row("\($ux\)",ux) \}
\{ row("\($ut \)",ut) \}
\{ row("\($uy \)",uy) \}
\{ row("\($uxx \)",uxx) \}
\{ row("\($utt\)",utt) \}
\{ row("\($uyy \)",uyy) \}
\{ endtable \}
$BR
For example the heat equation is \($heatleft = $heatright\). Enter this equation here:
$BR
$BCENTER \{$heatleft->ans_rule\} = \{$heatright->ans_rule\} $ECENTER
$BR
$BR
To answer questions that require you to input a PDE you will also need to know the form of the PDE WeBWorK is expecting. In particular you will need to use the same letters for constants that WeBWorK is expecting. Below is a table of the PDE's you will encounter in this homework.
$BR
$BBOLD Models $EBOLD
$BR
\{ begintable(2) \}
\{ row("Model","PDE") \}
\{ row("heat equation","\($heatleft = $heatright\)") \}
\{ row("heat equation with lateral heat transfer - \(u_m\) is the temperature of the surrounding medium and will be given, h is the constant from Newton's Law of Cooling","\($heatwithtransfer = $heatright\)") \}
\{ row("wave equation","\($waveleft = $waveright\)") \}
\{ row("wave equation with damping","\($waveleft = $wavedamping\)") \}
\{ row("wave equation with an external force (f(x,t) will specified in the problem)","\($waveleft + f(x,t) = $waveright\)") \}
\{ row("Laplace's equation","\($laplaceleft = $laplaceright\)") \}
\{ endtable \}
$BR
For problems with proportional quantities the constant of proportionality is c.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Entering Boundary and Initial Conditions $EBOLD
$BR 
Suppose that we want to enter the boundary condition \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\big\vert_{x=0}=0\). You will be given three answer blanks: the first is to input the partial derivative, ux, the second is to put the point at which the partial is being evaluated, (0,t), and the last will be for the right hand side. In WeBWorK notation the boundary condition would be given as ux(0,t) = 0, plug this in here:
$BR
$BCENTER
\{$ux->ans_rule(1)\}\{$point->ans_rule(2)\} = \{ans_rule(3)\}
$ECENTER
$BR
