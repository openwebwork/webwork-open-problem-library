## Function Definition
$T = Real(random(20,90));

$V = Real(random(5,20));
$Vprime = Real(non_zero_random(-10,10));
$t = Real(random(5,10));
$dPdt = NumberWithUnits("($Tprime*$V - $T*$Vprime)/($V^2)","Pa/s");

BEGIN_TEXT
The pressure, measured in Pascals (abbreviated Pa) on a certain object B is proportional to the temperature measured in degrees Kelvin (degK), and inversely proportional to the volume of B in cubic meters: 
\[P=\frac{T}{V}\; c\] 
where \(c\) is a physical constant that depends on B and converts the units to Pascals.  In this problem it is  
\[ c = 1 \frac{\text{Pa}*\text{m}^3}{\text{degK}}.\]
Suppose the temperature and the volume both depend on time, hence so the does the pressure: \(P(t) = \frac{T(t)}{V(t)} c\). At time \(t=$t\) seconds the temperature of B is \($T \; \text{degK}\) and is increasing at a rate of \($Tprime \; \frac{\text{degK}}{\text{s}}\), and the volume is \($V\; \text{m}^3\) and is increasing at the rate \($Vprime\; \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}}\).  
$PAR
Using the quotient rule, the pressure on the object is changing at the rate
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
Your answer should include units.
