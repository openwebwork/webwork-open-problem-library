TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of
\($a\) cubic feet per minute. It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular
cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.  How fast is the
height of the pile increasing when the pile is \($h\) feet high? Recall that the
volume of a right circular cone with height \(h\) and radius of the base \(r\)
is given by \(V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h \).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
We are given that the diameter and height are always the same, so \(2r=h\) or 
\(r=\frac{h}{2}\). 
$BR $BR The equation \( V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h \) can be rewritten as 
\( V= \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{h}{2} \right)^2h \) or \( V= \frac{1}{12}\pi h^3\). 
$BR $BR Differentiate both sides of the last equation with respect to time \((t)\): 
$BR $BR 
\(V' = \frac{1}{12}\pi 3 h^2 h'\)
$BR $BR 
\(V' = \frac{1}{4} \pi h^2 h'\) 
$BR $BR 
If \(V'=$a\) and \(h=$h\), then 
$BR $BR 
\($a = \frac{1}{4} \pi $h^2 h'\) 
$BR $BR 
\(\displaystyle h' = \frac{$a4}{$h^2\pi} = $ans\)
