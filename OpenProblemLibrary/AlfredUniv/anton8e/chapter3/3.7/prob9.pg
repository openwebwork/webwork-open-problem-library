A street light is at the top of a $a1 ft tall pole. A woman 6 ft tall
walks away from the pole with a speed of $b1 ft/sec along a straight path.
$BR
How fast is the distance between the woman and the tip of her shadow changing when she is $c1 ft from the base of the pole? \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
How fast is the tip of her shadow moving at the same time? \{ans_rule(20) \}
