BEGIN_TEXT

Oil spilled from a ruptured tank spreads in a circle whose area increases at a constant rate of $dA \(\frac {mi^2} {hr}\). How fast is the radius of the spill increasing when the area is $A \(mi^2 \)? The area is given by A, the radius by r, use pi for \(\pi\).
$PAR
We are given $dA \(\frac {mi^2} {hr}\) = \{ ans_rule(20) \}. (Leibniz notation)
$PAR
We are trying to find \{ ans_rule(20) \}. (Leibniz notation)
$PAR
When setting up the related rates equations to solve this problem, the number we would not plug until derivatives have been taken is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
The relationship between the two variables A and r is A = \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
The relationship between the rates of the two variables is dA/dt = \{ ans_rule(20) \} \(\frac {dr} {dt}\).
$PAR
And the answer is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
