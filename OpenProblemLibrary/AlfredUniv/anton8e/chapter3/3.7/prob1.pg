The sides of a square, x, are increasing at a rate of $a ft/s. We want to know the rate at which the area A grows when x = $b. 
$PAR
We are given $a ft/s = \{ ans_rule(20) \} (Leibniz notation).
$PAR
We are trying to find \{ ans_rule(20) \} (Leibniz notation).
$PAR
When setting up the related rates equations to solve this problem, the number we would not plug until derivatives have been taken is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
The relationship between the two variables A and x is A = \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
The relationship between the rates of the two variables is dA/dt = \{ ans_rule(20) \} dx/dt (your answer is a formula with x's in it).
$PAR
And the answer is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
