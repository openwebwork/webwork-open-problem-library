BEGIN_TEXT
Jim Bob the Rajin' Cajun has fully recovered from his initial ladder accident, and is ready to try it again. He is now at the top of a $l ft ladder. As you might have anticipated, the bottom of the ladder begins to slide away from the wall at a rate of $db ft/s. At what rate is he sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is $b ft from the base of the wall?
\{ans_rule(20)\}ft/s
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp(-$b*$db/(sqrt(($l)**2-($b)**2))));
