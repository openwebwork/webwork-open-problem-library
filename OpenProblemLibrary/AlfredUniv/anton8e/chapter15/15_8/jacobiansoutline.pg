BEGIN_TEXT
If a coordinate system (u,v,w) is transformed into a new coordinate system (x,y,z) by x(u,v,w),y(u,v,w), and z(u,v,w) then a cube in (u,v,w) space with volume dudvdw is transformed into a "cube" in (x,y,z) space with volume \(\Delta V=\left\vert\frac{\partial (x,y,z)}{\partial (u,v,w)}\right\vert dudvdw\). The quantity \(\frac{\partial (x,y,z)}{\partial (u,v,w)}\) is known as the Jacobian and is a general means of doing a change of variables:
$BR
If the transformation x,y,z takes a region S in (u,v,w) space to a region R in (x,y,z) space then
$BR
\(\int\!\!\int\limits_R\!\!\int f(x,y,z)\hskip{1pt}dV_{xyz}= \int\!\!\int\limits_S\!\!\int f(x(u,v,w),y(u,v,w),z(u,v,w))\hskip{1pt}\left\vert\frac{\partial (x,y,z)}{\partial (u,v,w)}\right\vert dV_{uvw}\)
