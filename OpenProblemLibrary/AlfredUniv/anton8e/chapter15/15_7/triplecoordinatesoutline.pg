BEGIN_TEXT
When you change variables in an integral that is in Cartesian coordinates you have to compute the volume element. The volume element is how much the volume of a small box dxdydz is multiplied by to give the volume of a small "box" in the new coordinate system. 
$BR
Cylindrical Coordinates:
$BR
\(\int\!\!\int\limits_R\!\!\int f(x,y,z)dxdydz = \int\!\!\int\limits_R\!\!\int f(r,\theta,z)rdrd\theta dz\)
$BR
Spherical Coordinates:
$BR
\(\int\!\!\int\limits_R\!\!\int f(x,y,z)dxdydz = \int\!\!\int\limits_R\!\!\int f(\rho,\theta,\phi)\rho^2\sin(\phi)d\rho d\phi d\theta\)
