Let \(\sigma\) be a smooth parametric surface whose vector equation is
$BR
$BCENTER
r = x(u,v)i + y(u,v)j + z(u,v)k
$ECENTER
where (u,v) varies over a region R in the u,v plane. Recall that the surface integral over \(\sigma\) is given by
$BCENTER
\[\int\limits_\sigma\!\!\int f(x,y,z)dS = \int\limits_R\!\!\int f(r(u,v))\left\Vert\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right\Vert dA\]
$ECENTER
FLUX
$BR
Let F be a fluid flow with \(\sigma\) immersed in F. Suppose that \(\sigma\) is permeable, so that the fluid can flow through it, and that the fluid is incompressible. 
$BR
We define \(\Phi\) as the flux of F across \(\sigma\) - the net volume of fluid flowing across \(\sigma\) in a unit of time. The fluid flowing across the surface is the amount of the vector F pointing in a direction perpendicular to the surface of \(\sigma\). Summing up the flow across small patches of \(\sigma\) we have
$BR
\[\Phi =\int\limits_\sigma\!\!\int F(x,y,z)\cdot n(x,y,z)dS\]
$BR
where n is the normal vector that determines the orientation of \(\sigma\):
$BCENTER
\(n = \frac{\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}} {\left\Vert\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right\Vert}\)
$ECENTER
and as above
$BCENTER
\(dS = \left\Vert\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right\Vert dA\)
$ECENTER
where \(dA\) is expressed in terms of du and dv. The scalars \(\left\Vert\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right\Vert\) in n and dS cancel so that 
$BCENTER
\[\Phi=\int\limits_R\!\!\int F\cdot\left(\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right)dA \]
