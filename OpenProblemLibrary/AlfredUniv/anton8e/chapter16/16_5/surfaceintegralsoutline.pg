Let \(\sigma\) be a smooth parametric surface whose vector equation is
$BR
$BCENTER
r = x(u,v)i + y(u,v)j + z(u,v)k
$ECENTER
where (u,v) varies over a region R in the u,v plane. 
$BR
SURFACE INTEGRALS
$BR
The surface integral over \(\sigma\) is the sum (ie integral) of a function value taken from a "small" patch of the surface times the area of the small patch (denoted dS). In integral notation the surface integral is
$BCENTER
\[\int\limits_\sigma\!\!\int f(x,y,z)dS\]
$ECENTER
For these small patches the area is approximately the area of the polygon formed by the two tangent vectors \(\frac {\partial r}{\partial u},\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\) to the surface. We know that the area of this polygon is given by the magnitude of the cross-product of these two vectors, so that:
$BCENTER
\(dS \approx \left\Vert\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right\Vert dA\)
$ECENTER
with the approximation getting better as the patches getting smaller. Therefore
$BCENTER
\[\int\limits_\sigma\!\!\int f(x,y,z)dS = \int\limits_r\!\!\int f(r(u,v))\left\Vert\frac {\partial r}{\partial u}\times\frac {\partial r}{\partial v}\right\Vert dA\]
$ECENTER
If \(\sigma\) is a surface given by a function \(z=g(x,y)\) then \(r = \langle u,v,f(u,v)\rangle\) and we can rewrite the surface integral as
$BR
\[\int\limits_\sigma\!\!\int f(x,y,s)dS = \int\limits_R\!\!\int f\left(x,y,g(x,y)\right)\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)^2+1}\hskip{2pt} dA\] 
$BR
with this equation being suitably changed if we have \(y=g(x,z)\) or \(x=g(y,z)\).
$BR 
If we take f = \(\delta\) = density, then \(\delta dS\) = mass of a small segment, so that
$BR
$BCENTER
\[{\rm M} = \int\limits_\sigma\!\!\int f(x,y,s)dS\]
$ECENTER
and if \(\delta = 1\) then M = S = surface area.

PARAMETRIC SURFACES
$BR
You should be able to parameterize 
$BR
1) A surface given by a function: r(u,v) = ui+vj+f(u,v)k.
$BR
2) A sphere of radius \(\rho\): r(u,v) =\(\rho\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi){\bf i}+ \rho\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi){\bf j} + \rho\cos(\phi){\bf k}\)
$BR
3) A surface of a box. For example the face given by \(x = 3\) on a cube with corners at (3,-2,-1), (3,4,-1), (3,-2,2), and (3,4,2) is given parametrically by  r(u,v) = \(3{\bf i} + u{\bf j} + v{\bf k}\) with \(-2 \leq u \leq 4, -1 \leq v \leq 2\)
