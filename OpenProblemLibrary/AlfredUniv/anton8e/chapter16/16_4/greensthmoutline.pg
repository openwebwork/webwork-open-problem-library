Green's Theorem: For a simply connected region R bounded by a simple closed curve C
$BR
\[\int_C f(x,y)dx+g(x,y)dy = \int\limits_R\!\!\int\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)dA\]
$BR 
if f,g are continuous with continuous partial derivatives in an open set containing R. The boundary C has to be oriented clockwise and closed (you end where you started) so we also use the notation:
$BR
\[\oint_C f(x,y)dx+g(x,y)dy\]
$BR
for the line integrals around a closed curve as in
$BR
\[\oint_C f(x,y)dx+g(x,y)dy = \int\limits_R\!\!\int\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)dA\]

Green's theorem can be used in several ways. One way is that the double integral is often easier to compute than the line integral. The line integral is related to the work done by a force field, so Green's theorem points to a deeper relationship with the work done by a force field and a double integral over the interior. Used in reverse, line integrals can also be used to compute area.

\({\bf Work:}\)
$BR
If a force field F is given by F(x,y) = f(x,y)i + g(x,y)j, then the work done by the field on a particle moving through the field along curve C(parameterized by r(t)) is:
$BR
\[\oint_C F\cdot dr = \oint_C f(x,y)dx+g(x,y)dy\]
$BR
\({\bf Flux:}\)
$BR
In another view of line integrals we have \[\oint_C F\cdot dr = \oint_C F\cdot TdS\] where T is a unit tangent vector to the curve C. This integral represents the "circulation" of the vector field around the curve C. 
$BR
To measure the flux across the boundary C we use \(F\cdot n\) where n is a unit normal vector to C. In this case, instead of the vector \(r^\prime (t) = x^\prime (t) + y^\prime (t)\) we use \(n = -y^\prime (t) + x^\prime (t)\), and Green's theorem becomes:
$BR
\[\oint_C -f(x,y)dy+g(x,y)dx = \int\limits_R\!\!\int\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)dA=\int\limits_R\!\!\int \left({\rm div}\hskip {2pt} {\rm F}\right)dA\]
$BR
A vector field is source free if \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{-\partial g}{\partial y}\), so that the flux integral is zero over any curve. A function \(\psi\) that satisfies \(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}= g\) and \(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}= -f\) is called a flow function. Like the potential function for work, 
$BR
\[\oint_C -f(x,y)dy+g(x,y)dx = \psi (Q) - \psi (P)\]
$BR
for any curve C that starts at point P and finishes at point Q.
