Things that you should know for this section:
$BR
\(f_{\mathbf v}\) is the rate of change of \(f\) in the direction of the vector \(\mathbf v\).
$BR
\(\nabla f =\langle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\rangle\).
$BR
\(f_{\mathbf v}=\frac{\nabla f\cdot {\mathbf v}} {\Vert {\mathbf v}\Vert}\).
$BR
\(\nabla f\) points in the direction of the greatest rate of change of \(f\).
$BR
\(\Vert\nabla f\Vert\) is the greatest rate of change of \(f\). 
$BR
\(\nabla f\) is perpendicular to the contours of \(f\)
