For the extrema section you should be familiar with the following ideas:
$BR
1) The gradient plays the role of the derivative from calcI - the critical points are where the gradient \(\nabla f = 0\). Remember that this is a vector equation, so it really is two equations to solve. Two equations will give you points, which have two coordinates, so that works out nicely.
$BR
2) In the 3D case there is no simple first derivative test, so we have to apply the second derivative test using the Hessian matrix or the discriminant as it is commonly called:$BR
\(D = f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2\) $BR
A) If D > 0 and \(f_{xx} > 0\) then the function has a local minimum at the point. $BR
B) If D > 0 and \(f_{xx} < 0\) then the function has a local maximum at the point. $BR
C) If D < 0 the function has a saddle point. $BR
D) D = 0 is the worst possible news, you can't draw any conclusions from that. $BR
