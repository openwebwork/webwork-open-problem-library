The population of mice in Alfred is given by \( P(t) = $p e^{$b t}\), where t is in years since 1986. The rate of change of the population is given by the formula \{ans_rule(20)\}mice/yr. In year $y the population changes by approximately \{ans_rule(20)\} mice. In $y $d mice died, which means that \{ans_rule(20)\} mice were born that year.
