$PAR
The knowledge K(t) that a civilization can amass in a year (measured in volumes of research published) is proportional to the knowledge it currently posses. If this civilization can add $percent% to its knowledge each year, and if this civilization possesses \($iv\) volumes of knowledge at time 0, write a differential equation for the amount of knowledge the civilization possesses:
$BR
$BCENTER \{ans_rule(3)\} \(=\) \{ans_rule(2)\}K $ECENTER
$BR
$BCENTER \(K(0) =\) \{ans_rule(8)\} $ECENTER
$BR
Note: use K,K' instead of K(t), K'(t) in the above answers. 
$BR

The solution of this equation is K(t) = \{ans_rule\}
