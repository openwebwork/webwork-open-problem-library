BEGIN_TEXT
The profit in thousands of dollars for a computer company is given by
\( P(x) = -x^2+$b x +$c \),
where \( x \) is thousands of units produced. (For example, \( P(2) = 8 \) means that the profit is 8 thousand dollars when 2 thousand units are produced.) 
$BR
$BR
(a) Determine how many thousands of units must be produced to yield maximum profit, and then determine the maximum profit.
	$PAR
	Maximum profit at \{ans_rule(20)\} thousand units.
        $PAR
        Maximum profit is \{ans_rule(20)\} thousand dollars.
$BR
$BR
b) Determine how many units should be produced for a profit of at least
\( 40 \) thousand dollars. (Hint:  Set the profit function equal to \( 40 \) and solve for \( x \).  Then find the interval on which profit is more than \( 40 \) thousand dollars.)
$PAR
Produce more than  \{ans_rule(20)\} thousands units,
$PAR
but less than  \{ans_rule(20)\} thousands units.
