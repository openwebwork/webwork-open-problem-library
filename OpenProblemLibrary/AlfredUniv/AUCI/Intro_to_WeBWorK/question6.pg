This problem will review $BBOLD order of operations,$EBOLD i.e., rules of precedence or order in which mathematical operations are performed.

$PAR

The rules are simple.  Exponentiation is always done before multiplication 
and division, and multiplication and division are always done before addition 
and subtraction. Mathematically we say exponentiation takes precedence over 
multiplication and division, etc. For example what is 1+2*3? You can use parentheses (and also square brackets [ ] or curly braces \(\lbrace \rbrace\)) if you want to change the normal way operations work.

$PAR

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD You must compute this number before entering it
	into WeBWorK.

$PAR

1+2*3 = \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR

END_TEXT

$ans = 7;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>'strict'));

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD You must compute this number before entering it
	into WeBWorK.


$PAR

What is \( 2\cdot 3^2 \)?  \{ ans_rule(25) \}

END_TEXT

$ans = 2*3**2;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>'strict'));

Now sometimes you want to force things to be done in a different way. This is
what parentheses are used for.
 
$PAR
 
$BBOLD Rule 1:$EBOLD Groups are simplified first.  That is, whatever is enclosed in parentheses (--), braces {--}, brackets [--], all in a numerator, all in a denominator, within an absolute value symbol |--|, or all under a radical \( \sqrt{x}\) are done before anything else (and things in the inner most parentheses are done first). 

$PAR

For example, simplfy the following expression yourself, then enter the expression in the box below:

$PAR

\[ \frac {1+|9-3|}{2+\sqrt{49}}\]

$PAR

$BBOLD  Hint: $EBOLD This is a good place to use [ ]'s and also to use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button. Also remember, |x| in standard notation is absolute value of x, so you must replace |x| with abs(x).

$PAR

\{ ans_rule(25) \}

END_TEXT

$ans = "(1+abs(9-3))/(2+sqrt(49))" ;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

Here are some more examples:

(1+3)9 = 36, (2*3)**2 = 6**2 = 36, 3**(2*2) = 3**4 = 81,
	(2+3)**2 = 5**2 = 25, 3**(2+2) = 3**4 = 81

$PAR

(Here we have used ** to denote exponentiation and you can also use this instead of a ${LQ}caret${RQ} if you want).  Try entering some of these and use the "Preview" button to see the result.  The "correct"
result for this answer blank is 36, but by using the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button, you can enter whatever 
you want and use WeBWorK as a hand calculator.

$PAR

\{ ans_rule(25) \}

$BBOLD Rule 2:$EBOLD The correct order of evaluation is 
$BR
$BR
> Roots and Powers (Exponents)
$BR
> Division and Multiplication
$BR
> Subtraction and Addition
$BR
$BR
Think! Correct order of operations goes from the hardest stuff (Roots) first to the easiest stuff (Addition) last.

$PAR
 
There is one other thing to be careful about.  Multiplication and
division have the same precedence.  For example, what does 2/3*4 mean?
(Note that / is the "division symbol", which is sometimes written as a
line with two dots. Don't think of / as the horizontal line in a
fraction. Ask yourself what 1/2/2 should mean.)  
 
$PAR
 
$BBOLD Rule 3:$EBOLD  Multiplication and divsion are evaluated from left to right.
 
$PAR
 
Example: 2/3*4 means (2/3)*4 = 8/3, IT DOES NOT MEAN 2/12.  If you want 2/(3*4) = 2/12, you have to use parentheses.

$PAR

$BBOLD Rule 4:$EBOLD  Addition and subtraction are evaluated from left to right.
 
$PAR
 
Example: The same thing happens with addition and subtraction as with multiplication and division. Notice 1-3+2 = 0, but 1-(3+2) = -4. 

$PAR

There are many situations in which using parentheses might be a good idea, even if they are not needed.

$PAR

Example: Write (2/3)*4 rather than 2/3*4. This is also a case where previewing your answer can save you a lot a grief since you will be able to see what
you entered.

$PAR

Enter 2/3*4 and use the Preview button to see what you get.
