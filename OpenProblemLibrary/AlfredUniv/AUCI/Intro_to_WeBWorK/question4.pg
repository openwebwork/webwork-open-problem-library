BEGIN_TEXT
This problem demonstrates WeBWorK questions in which the answer is a list of
 numbers
or an interval.
$PAR
Enter the first three numbers of the form \( n^2 \), where \(n\) is a
positive integer, as a comma separated list.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
You could have entered your answer as "1, 4, 9" (without the quotes), or
as "4, 1, 9", or as "2 $CARET 2, 1 $CARET 2, 3 $CARET 2".  The order of the
numbers does not matter, and you can still let WeBWorK evaluate expressions
for you.
$PAR
END_TEXT	

	ANS(number_list_cmp("1^2, 2^2, 3^2" ) );

Now we will enter a few intervals from the real line.  WeBWorK can
handle standard interval notation.  In each case, we will describe the
	set in a number of ways, and then show you how to enter it.  Let's start
with real numbers satisfying \(2\le x <5\).  The usual interval notation
for this inequality is \( [2, 5) \).
$BR
Enter the interval as shown:  \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR

$PAR
With interval notation, there is a difference between a square bracket "[" or "]" (which means
to include one or both end points) and a parenthesis "(" or ")" (which means not to include one or both
end points.)
END_TEXT	
ANS(interval_cmp("[2, 5)"));

$PAR
If we want to enter an interval for which one side is unbounded, such as
the real numbers greater than 3, we would normally write
\( (3, \infty) \).  Since computer keyboards do not come with an
infinity symbol, we just write out the word $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC.
So, enter (3, infinity).
$BR
 \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
If we had wanted \(-\infty\), we would type $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC
instead.  This is not standard notation, so, in general, read each problem carefully so you know how the author of the problem wants you to enter your answers.
END_TEXT	
ANS(interval_cmp("(3, infinity)"));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
Finally, sometimes intervals come in more than one piece.  For example,
the inequality
\( x^2 \ge 25 \)
is satisfied with \( x \ge 5 \) and also when \( x \le -5\).
This would be normally written as the union of two intervals:
\[ (-\infty, -5] \cup [5, \infty) \]
To type this into WeBWorK, we just use a capital U for the union symbol:
(-infinity, -5] U [5, infinity)
$BR
 \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
When using unions of intervals, the order of the smaller intervals does not
	matter, so you could also enter [5, infinity) U (-infinity, -5].
	$BR
END_TEXT
	
ANS(interval_cmp("(-infinity, -5] U [5, infinity)"));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
$HR
$PAR
Be aware that if you enter intervals which overlap, such as [2, 10)
 U (7, 15), WeBWorK will expect you to simplify it into a single interval,
	in this case [2, 15).
	$BR
	 \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
END_TEXT

ANS(interval_cmp("[2, 15)"));
