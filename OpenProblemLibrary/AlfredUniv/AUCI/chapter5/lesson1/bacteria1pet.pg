BEGIN_TEXT
The number of bacteria in a culture is given by the function
\[
n(t)=$p e^{$r t}
\]
where \(t\) is measured in hours.

$BR
(a) What is the rate of growth of the population (as a nonnegative percentage)?
$BR
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(10) \} % per hour.
$BR
$BR
(b) What is the initial population of the culture?
