BEGIN_TEXT
Certain radioactive material decays in such a way that the mass remaining 
after \(t\) years is given by the function
\[
m(t)=$p e^{-$r t}
\]
where \(m(t)\) is measured in grams.
$BR
$BR
(a) Find the mass at time \(t=0\).
$BR
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(20) \} grams.
$BR
$BR
(b) How much of the mass remains after $t years?
$BR
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(15) \} grams.
$BR
$BR
(c) What is the decay rate for this material (as a nonnegative percentage)?
$BR
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(15) \} % per year.
