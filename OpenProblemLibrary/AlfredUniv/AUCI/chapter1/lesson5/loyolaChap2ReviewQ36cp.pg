SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) \( r($x1) = $b - $m($x1)=$f1 \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) \( r($x1) = $f1 \) means water is entering the reservoir at $f1 gallons 
per second at time $BITALIC t $EITALIC = $x1 seconds.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) The vertical intercept first tells us that at time $BITALIC t $EITALIC = 0 seconds, the water is initially flowing in at the rate of $b gallons
per second.$BR
The horizontal intercept tells us that at \( $b/$m \approx $stop \) seconds, the flow has stopped.$BR
The slope is -$m.  This means that the rate  at which water enters the reservoir decreases by $m gallons per second each second. The water is flowing in at a
decreasing rate.
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) The reservoir has more and more water when the rate, \( r(t) \), is positive
because water is being added. Water is being added until \( t = $b/$m \) seconds later when it starts flowing out. This means at \( \ t = $b/$m \ \), the most water is in the reservoir. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
e) The reservoir has water draining out between \( \ t= $b/$m \ \) and \( \ t= $t_max \ \), but this amount is not as much as the water that entered between \( t=0 \) and \( t=$b/$m \). Thus, the reservoir had the least amount of water at the beginning when \( t=0 \). Remember the function \( r(t) \) gives the rate of flow, not the amount of water in the reservoir.
$BR $SPACE $BR
f) If the domain is specified as \( \ 0 \leq t \leq $t_max \ \) $SPACE , then  he rate varies from $b gallons per second  at \( t=0 \) to $f_min gallons per second at \( t=$t_max \ \) $SPACE , so the range is \( $f_min \leq r(t) \leq $b \).  In interval notation we express the range as \( \lbrack $f_min, $b \rbrack \) .
