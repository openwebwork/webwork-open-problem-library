BEGIN_TEXT
The amount of weekly sales in dollars by a small business is given by the function \( S(t) \), where \( t \) is weeks after January 1. Suppose sales on January 1 were \($y0\) dollars and sales \($t1\) weeks later were \($y1\) dollars.  Compute the following over the time interval \( [$t0,$t1] \).  Enter the units by typing the full words or phrases (e.g., feet per second).  
$PAR
\( \triangle t = \) \{ans_rule\}  Units? \{ans_rule(20)\} $str
$PAR
\( \triangle S = \) \{ans_rule\}   Units? \{ans_rule(20)\} $str
$PAR
\( \triangle S/\triangle t = \) \{ans_rule\}   Units? \{ans_rule(20)\} $str
$PAR
Use the average rate of change to estimate the weekly sales \($t2\) weeks after January 1: 
$PAR
\{ans_rule\}  Units? \{ans_rule(20)\} $str
