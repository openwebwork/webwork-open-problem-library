However, over the interval \( $x[1] \leq w \leq $x[2] \) we again have \( \triangle h = $m \), and now the average rate of change is $m/$dx[1].  The average rate of change keeps decreasing for the rest of intervals since the size of the $BITALIC w $EITALIC intervals is increasing. If the average rate of change is not constant over all intervals, then the function cannot be linear.",
