$BR
The slope is $m and the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept is $b.
$BR
a) The $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept $b is the monthly cost when $BITALIC n $EITALIC = 0.  It is therefore the cost if no minutes are used, which is the fixed monthly cost of phone service.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) The slope $m represents the rate of change of the cost with respect to a change in the number of minutes used.  This means for every additional minute you use, the cost increases by ${DOLLAR}$m .  The slope therefore represents the cost per minute.
