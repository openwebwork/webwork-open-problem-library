$BR $SPACE $BR
You start $b miles east of Pittsburgh and drive east at a constant speed of $m miles per hour. (Assume that the road is straight and permits you to do this.  Also assume that traveling eastward is considered positive.)  Find a formula for $BITALIC d${EITALIC}, your distance from Pittsburgh, as a function of $BITALIC t${EITALIC}, the number of hours of travel.

$BR
You initially (at time $BITALIC t $EITALIC = 0) start $b miles away from Pittsburgh, so the $BITALIC d${EITALIC}-intercept is $BITALIC b $EITALIC = $b.  As you drive, you head east.  Since you initially start east of Pittsburgh, your distance from Pittsburgh is increasing such that for every hour you drive, your distance $BITALIC d $EITALIC increases by $m miles.  The slope of this linear function is therefore $BITALIC m $EITALIC = $m, and the equation is \( d = $m t + $b \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
It is worth mentioning that if you start $b miles east of Pittsburgh and drive WEST at $m mph, then at first your distance from Pittsburgh would decrease since you are getting closer to Pittsburgh ($BITALIC m = $EITALIC -$m).  After you reached Pittsburgh and continued heading WEST at $m mph, the equation would change since the slope would be positive ($BITALIC m = $EITALIC -$m).  The problem becomes more complicated, and in fact you would need to set up a piecewise function (see chapter 2).
