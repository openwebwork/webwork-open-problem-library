BEGIN_TEXT
According to Ince [pg. 531] the first known use of integrating factors to solve a differential equation was by Fatio de Duiller in June of 1687. He was solving the equation \[3xdy - 2ydx = 0\] which we would write in standard form (using the prime notation) as
$BR
$BCENTER \{$left->ans_rule(15)\} \( =\) \{$right->ans_rule(5)\}. $ECENTER
$BR
For this equation the integrating factor is: \{$integratingfactor->ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
After multiplying both sides by the integrating factor and unapplying the product rule we get the new differential equation:
$BR
$BCENTER \(\frac{d}{dx}\big[\) \{$newleft->ans_rule(20)\} \(\big] = \)  \{$newright->ans_rule(20)\} $ECENTER
$BR 
Integrating both sides we get the algebraic equation
\{$integrateleft->ans_rule(30)\} \(=\) \{$integrateright->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
Solving for y, the solution to the differential equation is y = \{$solution->ans_rule(20)\} (using C as the constant)
