A tank contains \($A0\) kg of salt and \($w\) L of water. Water containing \($Ai\frac{kg}{L}\) of salt enters the tank at the rate \($ri\) \(\frac{L}{min}\). The solution is mixed and drains from the tank at the rate \($ro\) \(\frac{L}{min}\). A(t) is the amount of salt in the tank at time t measured in kilograms.

(a) A(0) = \{ans_rule(10) \} (kg) $BR
$BR 
(b) A differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank is 
\{$diffeqn->ans_rule(20)\} \(= 0\). (You need to use the prime notation for the derivatives, and move everything to the left hand side.)
