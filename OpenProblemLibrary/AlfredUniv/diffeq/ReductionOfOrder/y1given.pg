BEGIN_TEXT
The differential equation \[$diffeqn = 0\] has \($y1\) as a solution.
$BR
Applying reduction order we set \(y_2 = u $y1\).
$BR
Then (using the prime notation for the derivatives)
$BR
\(y_2^\prime = \) \{$dyp->ans_rule(25)\}
$BR
\(y_2^{\prime\prime} = \)  \{$d2yp->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
So, plugging \(y_2\) into the left side of the differential equation, and reducing, we get
$BR
$BCENTER \(x^2 y_2^{\prime\prime}-7x y_2^\prime +16y_2 = \) \{$reducedequation->ans_rule(30)\} $ECENTER
$BR
$BR

The reduced form has a common factor of \(x^5\) which we can divide out of the equation so that we have \(x u^{\prime\prime}+ u^\prime=0\). 
$BR
Since this equation does not have any u terms in it we can make the substitution \(w = u^\prime\) giving us the first order linear equation \(xw^\prime+w = 0\).
$BR
This equation has integrating factor \{$int->ans_rule\} for x > 0. 
$BR
If we use a as the constant of integration, the solution to this equation is \(w = \) \{$w->ans_rule\}
$BR
Integrating to get u, and using b as our second constant of integration we have \( u = \) \{$u->ans_rule\}
$BR
Finally \(y_2 = \) \{$yp->ans_rule\} and the general solution is \{$yp->ans_rule\}
