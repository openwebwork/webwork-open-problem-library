BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the equation for the charge on a capacitor in an LRC circuit
\[$diffeqn = E\]
which is linear with constant coefficients.
$BR
$BR
First we will work on solving the corresponding homogeneous equation. Divide through the equation by the coefficient on \(\frac{d^2q}{dt^2}\),
and find the auxiliary equation (using m as your variable) \{$auxeqn->ans_rule(25)\} \(= 0\) which has roots \{$factors->ans_rule(15)\}.
$BR
$BR
The solutions of the homogeneous equation are \{$homogeneous->ans_rule\}
$BR
$BR
Now we are ready to solve the nonhomogeneous equation  \($standard = $Lden E\).
We will use \($y1\) to do reduction of order (it doesn't matter which one of the homogenous solutions we choose), which will give us a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation. With this choice the particular solution has the form 
$BR
\(y_p = ue^{$a t}\).
$BR
Then (using the prime notation for the derivatives)
$BR
\(y_p^\prime = \) \{$dyp->ans_rule(25)\}
$BR
\(y_p^{\prime\prime} = \)  \{$d2yp->ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
So, plugging \(y_p\) into the left side of the differential equation, and reducing, we get
$BR
$BCENTER \(y_p^{\prime\prime}+$aandb y_p^\prime + $ab y_p = \) \{$reducedequation->ans_rule(30)\} $ECENTER
$BR
$BR

Using this reduced form, moving the term \($y1\) to the right side of the equation, we can rewrite \(y_p^{\prime\prime}+$aandb y_p^\prime + $ab y_p= $Lden E\)  in terms of \(u^{\prime\prime}\) and \(u^\prime\) as 
$BR
$BCENTER \{$left->ans_rule\} \(=\) \{$right->ans_rule\} $ECENTER
$BR
$BR
At this point to solve for u we want to integrate both sides, but to do that we need to integrate E. We will look at two special cases for E so that you get the idea how to proceed.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Case 1: E is a constant $EBOLD(DC voltage).
$BR
Then integrating both sides
$BR
\(u'+$aminusb u = \) \{$dcright->ans_rule\} (we don't use a constant when we do this integration, it turns out to be redundant)
$BR
This is a linear equation with integrating factor \{$int->ans_rule\}
$BR
Solving this equation, using b as our constant, we get that 
$BR
\(u = \) \{$dcu->ans_rule\}
$BR 
Plugging this back into \(y_p\) we finally find that 
$BR 
\(y_p =\) \{$dcsolution->ans_rule\}
$BR
Making the general solution \(y = a $y1 + y_p = a $y1 + b $y2 + \frac{$Lden E}{$ab}\). Notice that we already knew that \($y1\) and \($y2\) where solutions to the homogeneous equation, we just did all that work to figure out that the constant \(\frac{$Lden E}{$ab}\) is a solution of the nonhomogeneous equation, which is kind of obvious when you look at it. Now lets do an example where the answer will not be so obvious. 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Case 2:  E = sin(pt) $EBOLD (AC voltage). 
$BR
You might want to break out your TI-89, Maple, Mathematica, etc for this one. Or you can practice up your integration by parts, a lot.
$BR
Starting with the equation from above, \($left = $right\),
integrating both sides (again without using a constant) we get
$BR
\(u'+$aminusb u = \) \{$acright->ans_rule(70)\}
$BR
This is a linear equation with integrating factor \{$int->ans_rule\}, just like the example above. Solving this equation, using b as our constant, we get
$BR
\(u = \) \{$acu->ans_rule(90)\}
$BR 
Plugging this back into \(y_p\) we finally find that 
$BR 
\(y_p =\) \{$acsolution->ans_rule(60)\}
$BR
Making the general solution \(y = a $y1 + y_p = a $y1 + $acsolution\)
$BR
Since we already knew that \($y1\) and \($y2\) were solutions to the homogeneous equation, what we really worked out here is that the particular solution is \($yp\). Going back to look at our calculations, we could have done the integrations above without using constants, and pieced the solution together using superposition.
