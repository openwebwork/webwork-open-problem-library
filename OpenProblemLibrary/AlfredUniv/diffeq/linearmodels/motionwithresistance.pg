BEGIN_TEXT
For this problem y is the variable for the displacement, v is the velocity, m is the mass, k is the constant of proportionality.
$BR
The force on the object is the mass times the acceleration: \(F = \) \{$forcea->ans_rule(15)\} in terms of y or in terms of the velocity we have \(F = \) \{$forcev->ans_rule(15)\}.
$BR
For an object in free fall there are two forces: the force due to gravity (positive g) and the force due to air resistance, which is proportional to the velocity and acts in the opposite direction. Therefore \(F = \)  \{$force->ans_rule(20)\}.
$BR
Putting these two together we get a differential equation for the force acting on an object in free fall in terms of the velocity v:
$BR
\{$diffeqn->ans_rule(30)\} \( = 0\).
$BR
This equation is separable: \{$left->ans_rule(15)\}\(v^\prime = 1\), so we can integrate both sides with respect to t.
$BR
If we integrate both sides, combine all constants into one constant v0 then we get \(v = \) \{$v->ans_rule(15)\}.
Integrate again we find that \(y = \) \{$y->ans_rule(15)\}, where we use y0 as the integration constant.
