BEGIN_TEXT
A differential equation is $BBOLD linear $EBOLD if it is linear in the dependent variable and its derivatives: \(y,y^\prime,y^{\prime\prime},\ldots\). 
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\sin(x)\frac{d^5y}{dx^5}+\frac{x}{x^4+2x+1}\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+e^xy=\cos(x)\) is linear, although it is most definitely not linear in the independent variable x.
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\left(\frac{dP}{dt}\right)^2=x\) is not linear since the derivative of the dependent variable P is squared.
$BR
$BR
$BR
A differential equation is $BBOLD separable $EBOLD if it is first order and can be written in the form \(\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)g(y)\). In other words, you must be able to write the derivative as a product, one of which does not contain the dependent variable and the other of which does not contain the independent variable.
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\frac{dy}{dx}+xy=x\) is separable since we can write the equation in the form \(\frac{dy}{dx}= x(1-y)\).
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\frac{dz}{dt}+t^2z=t\) is not separable, rewriting we get \(\frac{dz}{dt}=t(1-tz)\). Try as you might you will not be able to factor out the t from term \(1-tz\). 
$BR
$BR
Example: \((x^2+1)\frac{dy}{dx}-(x^2+1)y=(x^3+x)y\) is separable, if we divide through by \(x^2+1:\) \(\frac{dy}{dx}=y(x+1)\).
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\frac{dy}{dx}=x\) is separable with \(f(x) = x\) and \(g(y)=1\).
$BR
$BR
$BR
A differential equation is $BBOLD autonomous $EBOLD if it is first order and can be written in the form \(\frac{dy}{dx}=g(y)\).
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\frac{dP}{dt}=P\) is autonomous with \(g(P)=P\).
$BR
$BR
Example \(\frac{dy}{dx}+x-\sin^2(y)x=\sin(y) + \cos^2(y)x\) is autonomous since \(x-\sin^2(y)x=x(1-\sin^2(y))=x\cos^2(y)\), reducing the equation to \(\frac{dy}{dx}=\sin(y)\)
$BR
$BR
$BR
A linear differential equation is $BBOLD homogeneous $EBOLD if there are no terms that contain the independent variable alone.
$BR
$BR
Example:  \(\sin(x)\frac{d^5y}{dx^5}+\frac{x}{x^4+2x+1}\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+e^xy=0\)
is homogeneous.
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2+t\frac{dy}{dt}=0\) is not homogeneous because it is not linear.
$BR
$BR
Example: \(\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+t\frac{dy}{dt}-t=0\) is not homogeneous because of the lone t.
$BR
$BR
Note that homogeneous is one of the most abused words in mathematics, there are multiple definitions for this word in use. This is the one we will use.
