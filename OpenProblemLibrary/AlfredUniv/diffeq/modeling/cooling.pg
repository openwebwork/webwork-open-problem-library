Let A(t) be the amount of money that people have donated for a community project with time t in weeks. The closer the amount of money is to the goal of $\($K\) the less people donate per week, the person in charge has notice that the amount they receive per week is \($percent\) percent of the difference between the goal and the amount received. Write a differential equation for the donations received:
$BR
\{$DE->ans_rule()\} \(= 0\)
$BR
\(A(0) =\) \{$iv->ans_rule\}
$BR
If this simple model where to hold true why would the community project be in trouble?
$BR
Note: use A,A', etc instead of A(t), A'(t) in your answers. After you set up your differential equation you will have to set it equal to zero so that WeBWorK will understand your answer, do this in a way so that the highest order derivative has a positive coefficient.
