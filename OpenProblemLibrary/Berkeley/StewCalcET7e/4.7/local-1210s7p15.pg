I have enough pure silver to coat \( $a \) square meters of surface area.
I plan to coat a sphere and a cube, and to use all of the silver in doing so.

silver going onto one of the solids, what dimensions should they be if the
total volume of the silvered solids is to be a maximum? $PAR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$SOL

Let \(r\) be the radius of the sphere in meters,
\(s\) the length of the cube in meters, \(A\) the total area in square meters,
and \(V\) the total volume in cubic meters.
Then

\[A=4\pi r^2+6s^2\]
and
\[V= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 + s^3.\]

$PAR
This involves two variables, \(r\) and \(s\), but they are related
by the area equation (since \(A\) is fixed at $a square meters).
So, we can use this equation to solve for \(s\) in terms of \(r\).
This gives
\[s= \sqrt{\frac{A-4\pi r^2}{6}}.\]
Substituting this value in the volume equation gives
\[V= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 + \left(\frac{A-4 \pi r^2}{6}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}.\]
Differentiating with respect to \(r\) then gives
\[V' = 4\pi r^2 + \frac32\left(\frac{A-4\pi r^2}{6}\right)^{1/2}
    \left(\frac{-8\pi r}{6}\right)
  = 2\pi r(2r-s).\]
Setting this to zero gives \(r=0\) (which we ignore since it's an endpoint)
and \(s=2r\).  Solving for the latter in the area equation gives
\[r = \sqrt{\frac A{4\pi+24}}\;.\]

$PAR
(We want to find the values of \(r\) and \(s\) where this function has its
maximum and minimum.  Since the endpoints \(r=0\) and \(r=\sqrt{A/4\pi}\)
correspond to all of the silver going to the cube and to the sphere,
respectively, and these two possibilities are explicitly included,
this indeed is a question of finding the extrema of the above function
over a closed interval.)

$PAR
So, including also the endpoints \(r=0\) and \(r=\sqrt{A/4\pi}\) gives the
following candidates for maxima and minima:
\[ \begin{aligned}
  V(0) &= \frac{A^{3/2}}{6\sqrt6}\;; \\
  V\left(\sqrt{\frac A{4\pi+24}}\right) &= \frac{A^{3/2}}{6\sqrt{\pi+6}}\;; \\
  V\left(\sqrt{\frac A{4\pi}}\right) &= \frac{A^{3/2}}{6\sqrt\pi}\;.
\end{aligned} \]

$PAR
Of these, the largest is the last one, corresponding to putting everything into
the sphere.  In that case,
\[r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}} \approx !{$rmax:%5.4f}\hbox{~meters}\]
(and \(s=0\) meters).
$PAR
The smallest value of \(V\) occurs at the critical point we found,
so the smallest volume occurs when
\[r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi+24}} \approx !{$rmin:%5.4f}\hbox{~meters}\]
and
\[s = 2r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi+6}} \approx !{$smin:%5.4f}\hbox{~meters.}\]
