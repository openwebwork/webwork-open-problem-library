BEGIN_TEXT

In a sample of 40 grown-ups, the mean assembly time for a boxed swing set was $x hours with a standard deviation of $s hours. The makers of this swing set claim the average assembly time is less than 2 hours.

(a) Find the test statistic.

(b) Test their claim at the 0.01 significance level.

Critical value: \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
Is there sufficient data to support their claim?
