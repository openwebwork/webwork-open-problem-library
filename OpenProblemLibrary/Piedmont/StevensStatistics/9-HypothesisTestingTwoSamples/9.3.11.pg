BEGIN_TEXT

The term 'Boomerang Generation' refers to the recent generation of young adults who have had to move back in with their parents.  In a 2012 survey, $x1 out of $n1 randomly selected young adults (ages 18-34) had to move back in with their parents after living alone. In a similar survey from the year 2000, $x2 out of $n2 young adults had to move back in with their parents.
$PAR

The table below summarizes this information. The standard error (SE) is given to save calculation time.
$PAR

\{
DataTable(
  [
    ['year', 'total # who moved back (\(x\))',
        'total # in survey (\(n\))', 'proportion \(\hat p = x/n\)'],
    [2012, $x1, $n1, $p1],
    [2000, $x2, $n2, $p2],
    [['Standard Error: SE = $se',colspan=>4,b=>1]],
  ], 
);
\}
$PAR

Test the claim that a greater proportion of all young adults moved back in with their parents in 2012 than in 2000. Test this claim at the 0.05 significance level.
$PAR

(a) Find the test statistic.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) Find the critical value.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Find the \(p\)-value.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(d) Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
$BR
\{$result1->buttons()\}
$PAR
$PAR

Can you support the claim at the 0.01 significance level?
$PAR

(e) Find the critical value.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(f) Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
$BR
