BEGIN_TEXT

It is widely accepted that people are a little taller in the morning than at
night. Here we perform a test on how big the difference is. In a sample of 35 adults, the mean difference between morning height and evening height was $dbar millimeters (mm) with a standard deviation of $s
mm. Test the claim that, on average, people are more than 5 mm taller in the morning than at night.  Test this claim at the 0.05 significance level.
$PAR

(a) Find the test statistic.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) Find the critical value.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
$BR
