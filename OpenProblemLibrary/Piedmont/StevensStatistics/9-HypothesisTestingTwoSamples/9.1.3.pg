BEGIN_TEXT

Many high school students take the SAT's twice; once in their Junior year and once in their Senior year. In a sample of 200 such students, the average of the differences was $dbar points with a standard deviation of $s points.
$PAR

Test the claim that retaking the SAT increases the score on average by more than 30 points.
$PAR

(a) Find the test statistic.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) Test the claim at the 0.10 significance level.
$PAR
Critical value: \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
$BR
\{$result1->buttons()\}
$PAR

(c) Test the claim at the 0.01 significance level.
$PAR
Critical value: \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
$BR
\{$result2->buttons()\}
