BEGIN_TEXT

There is a lot of interest in the relationship between studying music and studying math. We will look at some sample data that investigates this relationship. Here are the Math SAT scores from $n1 students who studied music through high school and $n2 students who did not. The degrees
of freedom (d.f.) is given to save calculation time if you are not using software.
$PAR

\{
DataTable(
  [
    [['',headerrow=>1],['Math SAT Scores',colspan=>$n2],'mean','\(s^2\)','\(s\)'],
    ['Music (\(x_1\))', @music, ['',colspan=>$n2-$n1],$xbar1,$s1*$s1, $s1],
    ['No Music (\(x_2\))', @no_music, $xbar2, $s2*$s2, $s2],
    [['degrees of freedom: d.f. = $df',colspan=>$n2+4,headerrow=>1]],
  ], 
);
\}
$PAR

Test the claim that students who study music in high school have a higher average Math SAT score than those who do not.  Use a 0.01 significance level.
$PAR

(a) Find the test statistic.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(b) Find the critical value.
$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(c) Is there sufficient data to support the claim?
$BR
