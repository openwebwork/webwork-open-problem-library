BEGIN_TEXT
A bottling plant bottles a lot of pop. There are often errors that result in defective bottles. The plant manager wants to know if these defects happen more frequently on different days of the week. She has a lot of data (too much to put here) but the sample sizes and means are given in the table below. The second table displays results from an ANOVA test on the full data set.  The manager claims there is a difference in the mean number of defects between production days.

(a) Test this claim at the 0.05 significance level.
$PAR

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the population means are not equal.

$PAR

(b) Does your conclusion change at the 0.01 significance level?
