BEGIN_PGML

A function [`f(x)`] and interval [`[a, b]`] are given.
Check if Rolle's Theorem can be applied to [`f`] on [`[a, b]`].
If so, find all values [`c`] in [`[a, b]`] such that [`f'(c) = 0`].

[```
  f(x) = [$f] \qquad \textrm{on} \; [[$p1], [$p2]]
```]

[_]{$RMA}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
[`f(x) = [$f]`] is not continuous at [`x = [$c]`], as
there is division by zero at that point:
[``
  [$f] = \dfrac{1}{(x - [$c])^2}.
``]

Since [`f(x)`] is not continuous on the interval [`[[$p1], [$p2]]`],
Rolle's Theorem does not apply.
