BEGIN_PGML
A function [`f(x)`] and interval [`[a, b]`] are given.

Check if Rolle's Theorem can be applied to [`f`] on [`[a, b]`].

a) [`f(x) = [$a]`] on [`[-[$b], [$b]]`].

    [` f `] [_]{$cont1} continuous on [`[-[$b], [$b]]`].

    [` f `] [_]{$diff1} differentiable on [`(-[$b], [$b])`].

    [` f(-[$b]) = `] [_]{$fa1}{6} and [` f([$b]) = `] [_]{$fb1}{6}.

    The two values are [_]{$eq1}.

    Rolle's Theorem [_]{$rolle1} apply in this situation.

b) [`f(x) = [$a] x`] on [`[-[$b], [$b]]`].

    [` f `] [_]{$cont2} continuous on [`[-[$b], [$b]]`].

    [` f `] [_]{$diff2} differentiable on [`(-[$b], [$b])`].

    [` f(-[$b]) = `] [_]{$fa2}{6} and [` f([$b]) = `] [_]{$fb2}{6}.

    The two values are [_]{$eq2}.

    Rolle's Theorem [_]{$rolle2} apply in this situation.

c) [`f(x) = [$a] |x|`] on [`[-[$b], [$b]]`].

    [` f `] [_]{$cont3} continuous on [`[-[$b], [$b]]`].

    [` f `] [_]{$diff3} differentiable on [`(-[$b], [$b])`].

    [` f(-[$b]) = `] [_]{$fa3}{6} and [` f([$b]) = `] [_]{$fb3}{6}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) Since [`f(x) = [$a] `] is a constant function, [`f`] is
continuous and differentiable.  Furthermore, since
[`f(-[$b]) = [$a] = f([$b])`], Rolle's Theorem applies.

b) Since [`f(x) = [$a] x`] is a linear function, [`f`] is
continuous and differentiable.  However, [` f(-[$b]) = -[$ab]`]
is not equal to [`f([$b]) = [$ab]`], so Rolle's Theorem
does not apply.

c) [`f(x) = [$a] |x|`] is continuous, but not differentiable
on the given interval (there is a corner point at [`x = 0`]).
Rolle's Theorem does not apply, even though the function
values are the same: [` f(-[$b]) = [$ab] = f([$b]) `].
