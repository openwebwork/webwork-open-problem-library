BEGIN_PGML

An object is thrown straight up with a velocity, in
ft/s, given by [`v(t) = -32t + [$b]`], where [`t`] is
in seconds, from a height of [$h] feet.

Include units on all answers.  [@ helpLink('units') @]*

a) What is the object's initial velocity? [_]{$ans1}{20}

b) What is the object's maximum velocity? [_]{$ans2}{20}

c) What is the object's maximum displacement? [_]{$ans3}{20}

d) When does the maximum displacement occur? [_]{$ans4}{20}

e) When is the object's displacement 0? [_]{$ans5}{20}

f) What is the object's maximum height? [_]{$ans6}{20}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) The initial velocity is [`v(0) = [$b]`] ft/s.

b) The maximum velocity is the same as the initial velocity, [$b] ft/s,
in this problem.  This is because there are no critical
values for [`v`] (since [`v'(t) = -32`] has no zeros), and
so the extremes must occur at endpoints.

c) First determine when velocity is positive or negative.
[```
  -32 t + [$b] > 0 \;\Rightarrow\; t < \dfrac{[$b]}{32}.
```]
Thus, velocity is only positive in the interval [` [0, [$b]/32] `],
so the maximum displacement must occur at time [`t = [$b]/32`] s.
Find the area of the triangle formed by the graph of [`v`],
which has base [`[$b]/32`] and height [$b].
[```
  \textrm{Area} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{[$b]}{32}\right)([$b]) 
  = [$ans3] \,\textrm{ft}.
```]

d) The maximum displacement occurs at [`t = [$b] / 32`]s (see above).

e) The object's displacement will be 0 when the net area
of [`v(t)`] is zero.  Since the graph of [`v(t)`] is a straight
line, one can see that this occurs when [`t`] is
twice the value of the [`t`]-intercept, that is,
[```
  t = 2\left(\frac{[$b]}{32}\right) = \frac{[$b]}{16} \,\textrm{s}.
```]

f) This is found by adding the maximum displacement to
the initial height.
[```
  [$h] + [$ans3] = [$ans6]\,\textrm{ft}.
```]
