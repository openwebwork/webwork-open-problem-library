$ans = DropDown([ "feet", "hours", "feet/hour", "hour/feet" ], "feet/hour");

BEGIN_PGML
The height [`H`], in feet, of a river is recorded [`t`]
hours after midnight, April 1.  What are the units
of [`H'(t) `] ?

[_]{$ans}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since [` H'(t) `] measures the rate of change of [`H`] (in *feet*) with respect to change in [`t`] (in *hours*), the units must be *feet per hour*, or *feet/hour*.
END_PGML_SOLUTION
