BEGIN_PGML
Fill in each blank to construct an [`\epsilon`]-[`\delta`] proof showing that 
[```
 \lim_{x \to [$c]}\; (x^2 - [$a]) = [$L].
```]
Where it asks for a formula for [`\delta`], use the largest value that will work.


*Proof.* Let [_]{$eps} [` > 0`] be given.


We are interested in values of [`x`] that are close to [`[$c]`] so we may assume that [`[$cmin] < x < [$cmax]`]. Thus [`[$c1] < x+[$c] < [$c2]`].

Then with [`\delta = `] [_]{$m} [`\epsilon`], and with [`x`] satisfying

>>[`\Big|x - `] [_]{$c} [`\Big| < `] [_]{$del},<<
(after some algebra), we arrive at:
>>[`\Big|f(x) - `] [_]{$L} [`\Big| < `] [_]{$eps},<<
which is what we wanted to prove.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
*Solution:*


First, we should do some scratch work. 
With [`f(x) = x^2 - [$a]`], and limiting value [`[$L]`], we must solve the
inequality:

>>[`|f(x) - [$L]| < \epsilon `]<<

>>[`|x^2 - [$a] - [$L]| < \epsilon `]<<

>>[`|x^2 - [$b]| < \epsilon `]<<

>>[`|x - [$c]|\cdot|x + [$c]| < \epsilon `]<<

>>[``|x - [$c]| < \frac{\epsilon}{|x+[$c]|} ``]<<


Since [`x`] is near [`[$c]`], we can safely assume that [`[$cmin] < x < [$cmax]`]. Thus

>>[`[$cmin] + [$c] < x + [$c] < [$cmax] + [$c] `]<<

>>[`[$c1] < x + [$c] < [$c2] `]<<

>>[``\frac{1}{[$c1]} > \frac{1}{x + [$c]} > \frac{1}{[$c2]} ``]<<

>>[``\frac{\epsilon}{[$c1]} > \frac{\epsilon}{x + [$c]} > 
   \frac{\epsilon}{[$c2]} ``]<<


This implies we can let [`\delta = \frac{1}{[$c2]} \epsilon`].  Now reverse
the steps to construct the proof.


*Proof of the limit:*

Let [`\epsilon > 0`] be given.  Then with 
[`\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{[$c2]}`],
and with [`x`] satisfying [`|x - [$c]| < \delta`],

>>[`|x - [$c]| < \delta = \frac{1}{[$c2]}\epsilon < \frac{\epsilon}{x + [$c]}`]<<

>>[`|x - [$c]|\cdot |x + [$c]| < \frac{\epsilon}{x + [$c]} \cdot |x + [$c]| `]<<

Assuming [`x`] is near [`[$c]`], [`x+[$c]`] is positive and we can
drop the absolute value signs on the right, allowing [`(x + [$c])`]
to cancel.
>>[`|x - [$c]|\cdot |x + [$c]| < \epsilon `]<<

>>[`|x^2 - [$b]| < \epsilon `]<<

>>[`|x^2 - [$a] - [$L]| < \epsilon `]<<


The last line shows [`|f(x) - [$L]| < \epsilon`], which is what
we wanted to prove.
