BEGIN_PGML
The graph of [`f`] is shown below.

[![$altTextf]!]{$graphf}{$w}
<<

Choose the graph that best represents [` f'`]. [_]{$ans}

    A. [![$altText[0]]!]{$graphs[0]}{$w*0.6}

    B. [![$altText[1]]!]{$graphs[1]}{$w*0.6}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
When [`f`] has negative slope, [`f'`] will have negative value.

When [`f`] has positive slope, [`f'`] will have positive value.

What is the slope of [`f`] at [`x=0`]? Which of the graphs has an appropriate value for [`f'(0)`]?
