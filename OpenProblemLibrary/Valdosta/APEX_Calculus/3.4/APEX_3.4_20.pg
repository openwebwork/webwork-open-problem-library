SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR
\( f'(x) = $df \) and \(f''(x) = $ddf \).  Set \(f''(x) = 0\)
and solve. 
\[
  $ddf = 0 \;\Rightarrow \; 3x(x - $b2) = 0.
\]
$PAR  
Thus, concavity could change at \(x = 0\) and \(x = $b2\).
By testing sample points in each interval, we find \(f'' > 0\) 
(\(f\) is concave up)
on \( (-\infty, 0) \cup ($b2, \infty) \) and \(f'' < 0\)
(\(f\) is concave down)
on \( (0, $b2) \). 
$PAR
Therefore, there are inflection points at \(x = 0, $b2\).
Plug these \(x\) values into the original function to find 
the corresponding
\(y\)-values:
\[
  f(0) = $y1, \quad f($b2) = $y2.
\]
The inflection points occur at \( (0, $y1) \) and
\( ($b2, $y2) \).

$PAR
Find critical numbers by setting \(f'(x) = 0\)
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    $df &=& 0 \\
    x^2(x - $c2) &=& 0 \\  
    &&\\
    x &=& 0, $c2.
  \end{array}
\]
Since \(f''(0) = 0\), the Second Derivative Test is inconclusive.
However, the First Derivative Test shows that there is neither
a minimum nor maximum at \(x = 0\), since \(f'(x)\) does not
change sign at \(x = 0\).$BR
Since \(f''($c2) > 0\), there is a local minimum at \(x = $c2\).

$PAR
To find where \(f'(x)\) will have a relative extreme point,
first set \(f''(x) = 0\).  As above, \(x = 0, $b2\).$BR
Find \( f'''(x) =  6x - $d \).  Since \(f'''(0) = -$d < 0\),
there is a local maximum (for \(f'\)) at \(x = 0\).
Since \(f'''($b2) = $d > 0\), there is a 
local minimum (for \(f'\)) at \(x = $b2\).
