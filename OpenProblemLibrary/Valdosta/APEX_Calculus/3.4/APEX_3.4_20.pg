BEGIN_PGML
*Note:* For any questions that asks you to enter all values, enter a list separated by commas.  If there are no such values, enter "None".

Let [`` f(x) = [$f] ``].

a) Determine the intervals on which [`f`] is concave up and concave down. [@helpLink('interval')@]*
    - [`f`] is concave up on [_]{$ans_cu}{30}
    - [`f`] is concave down on [_]{$ans_cd}{30}

b) Based on your answer to part a, determine the
inflection points of [`f`].

    Each point should be entered as an *ordered pair*
(that is, in the form [` (x, y) `]).

    The inflection points are [_]{$infl}{25}

c) Find the critical numbers of [`f`] and use the Second
Derivative Test, when possible, to determine the relative
extrema.  List only the [`x`]-coordinates.
    - Relative maxima at [`x=`] [_]{$max}{20}
    - Relative minima at: [`x=`] [_]{$min}{20}

d) Find the [`x`]-value(s) where [`f'(x)`] has a relative maximum
or minimum.
    - [`f'`] has relative maxima at [`x=`] [_]{$max1}{20}
    - [`f'`] has relative minima at [`x=`] [_]{$min1}{20}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
[` f'(x) = [$df] `] and [`f''(x) = [$ddf] `].

Set [`f''(x) = 0`] and solve:

[`` [$ddf] = 0 \;\Rightarrow \; 3x(x - [$b2]) = 0. ``]

Thus, concavity could change at [`x = 0`] and [`x = [$b2]`].
By testing sample points in each interval, we find [`f'' > 0`]
([`f`] is concave up)
on [` (-\infty, 0) , ([$b2], \infty) `] and [`f'' < 0`]
([`f`] is concave down)
on [` (0, [$b2]) `].

Therefore, there are inflection points at [`x = 0, [$b2]`].
Plug these [`x`] values into the original function to find 
the corresponding
[`y`]-values:

[`` f(0) = [$y1], \quad f([$b2]) = [$y2]. ``]

The inflection points occur at [` (0, [$y1]) `] and
[` ([$b2], [$y2]) `].

Find critical numbers by setting [`f'(x) = 0`]

[``
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    [$df] &=& 0 \\
    x^2(x - [$c2]) &=& 0 \\  
    \\
    x &=& 0, [$c2].
  \end{array}
``]

Since [`f''(0) = 0`], the Second Derivative Test is inconclusive.
However, the First Derivative Test shows that there is neither
a minimum nor maximum at [`x = 0`], since [`f'(x)`] does not
change sign at [`x = 0`]. 

Since [`f''([$c2]) > 0`], there is a local minimum at [`x = [$c2]`].

To find where [`f'(x)`] will have a relative extreme point,
first set [`f''(x) = 0`].  As above, [`x = 0, [$b2]`].

Find [` f'''(x) =  6x - [$d] `].

- Since [`f'''(0) = -[$d] < 0`],
there is a local maximum (for [`f'`]) at [`x = 0`].
- Since [`f'''([$b2]) = [$d] > 0`], there is a 
local minimum (for [`f'`]) at [`x = [$b2]`].
