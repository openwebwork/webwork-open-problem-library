Suppose a police officer is 1/2 mile south of an intersection, driving
north towards the intersection at [$Va] mph. At the same time,
another car is 1/2 mile east of the intersection driving east, away from the intersection.  

1. Suppose the officer's
radar gun indicates [$Vc] mph when pointed at the other
car (that is, the straight-line distance between the officer
and the other car is increasing at a rate of [$Vc] mph).
What is the speed of the other car?   [_]{Compute($ans1)} mph.

2.  Now suppose that the officer's radar gun indicates -[$Vc] mph
instead (that is, the straight-line distance is *decreasing* at
a rate of [$Vc] mph).  What is the speed of the other
car this time?   [_]{Compute($ans2)} mph.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The two cars and the intersection form a right triangle.
Let  
    [`a = `] distance from the officer's car to the
intersection (along the north-south street),  
    [`b = `] distance from the intersection
to the other car (along the west-east street),  
    [`c = `] straight-line distance from the officer's car to the
other car.  

The Pythagorean Theorem says that
[` a^2 + b^2 = c^2`].
Take time-derivatives of both sides of this
equation.  
[```
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{dt}\left( a^2 + b^2 \right) &=
    \frac{d}{dt}\left( c^2 \right) \\
    2a\frac{da}{dt} + 2b\frac{db}{dt} &= 2c\frac{dc}{dt}
  \end{aligned}
```]
At the time when the officer used the radar gun 
[```\frac{da}{dt} = -[$Va] \quad\text{and}\quad\quad a = b = 1/2```]
(the officer's velocity is negative because [`a`] is decreasing). So the Pythagorean theorem says the distance between the cars at this particular
 time was 
[```c = \sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2} = \sqrt{2}/2.```]
miles.  Plug these numbers into the time-derivative equation to obtain
[``` \begin{gathered}
        2\cdot\frac{1}{2}(-[$Va]) + 2\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{db}{dt} = 2\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\cdot\frac{dc}{dt}\\
        -35 + \frac{db}{dt} = \sqrt{2}\frac{dc}{dt}
     \end{gathered} ```]

1.  In the first part [`c`] is changing at the rate
[```\frac{dc}{dt} = [$Vc]\quad```] 
Plug this into the above equation to obtain the speed of the other car
[```
    \frac{db}{dt} = [$Vc] \sqrt{2} + [$Va] \approx [$ans1]
```]
miles per hour.  

2.  In the second part, 
[```\dfrac{dc}{dt} =  -[$Vc]```]
So the speed of the second car is
[```
    \frac{db}{dt} = -[$Vc] \sqrt{2} + [$Va] \approx [$ans2]
```]
miles per hour.
