$PAR
Suppose a police officer is 1/2 mile south of an intersection, driving
north towards the intersection at $Va mph. At the same time,
another car is 1/2 mile east of the intersection, 
driving east (away
from the intersection) at an unknown speed.  The officer's
radar gun indicates $Vc mph when pointed at the other
car (that is, the straight-line distance between the officer
and the other car is increasing at a rate of $Vc mph).
What is the speed of the other car?
$PAR
Speed = \{ ans_rule(15) \} mph.
$PAR
Now suppose that the officer's radar gun indicates -$Vc mph
instead
(that is, the straight-line distance is decreasing at
a rate of $Vc mph).  What is the speed of the other
car this time?
$PAR
Speed = \{ ans_rule(15) \} mph.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR
The two cars and the intersection form a right triangle.
Let \(a = \) distance from the officer's car to the
intersection (along the north-south street), 
and \(b = \) distance from the intersection
to the other car (along the west-east street).  Let
\(c = \) straight-line distance from the officer's car to the
other car.  Then by the Pythagorean Theorem,
\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).
Take time-derivatives of both sides of this
equation.  
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    \dfrac{d}{dt}\left[ a^2 + b^2 \right] &=&
    \dfrac{d}{dt}\left[ c^2 \right] \\
    &&\\
    2a\dfrac{da}{dt} + 2b\dfrac{db}{dt} &=& 2c\dfrac{dc}{dt}\\
  \end{array}
\]
Then plug in
the known information and solve.
We have \( \dfrac{da}{dt} = -$Va \), which is negative
because the distance from the officer to the intersection
is decreasing.  We also have \( \dfrac{dc}{dt} = $Vc\).
We can find the distance between the cars at this
specific moment: \( c = \sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2}
= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-$Va\right) + 
    2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\dfrac{db}{dt} &=& 
    2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)($Vc)\\
    &&\\
    \dfrac{db}{dt} = $Vc \sqrt{2} + $Va \approx $ans1.
  \end{array}
\]
$PAR
For the second part, \(\dfrac{dc}{dt} =  -$Vc\).
\[
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-$Va\right) + 
    2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\dfrac{db}{dt} &=& 
    2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)(-$Vc)\\
    &&\\
    \dfrac{db}{dt} = -$Vc \sqrt{2} + $Va \approx $ans2.
  \end{array}
\]
