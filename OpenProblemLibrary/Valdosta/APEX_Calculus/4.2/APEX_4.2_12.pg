$PAR
A rope, attached to a weight, goes up through a pulley
at the ceiling and back down to a worker.  The worker
holds the rope at the same height as the connection
point between the rope and weight.  
The distance from the connection point to the ceiling is $h0 ft.
Suppose the worker
stands directly next to the weight (i.e., a total rope
length of $rope ft) and begins to walk away at a constant rate
of $rate ft/s.  How fast is the weight rising
when the worker has walked:

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR
The worker, weight and pulley form a right
triangle with height $h0, base length \(x\),
and hypotenuse \(z\).
The speed at which the weight rises is the
same as the speed the rope is being pulled.
This means the rate we are looking for
is \(\dfrac{dz}{dt}\).

By the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[
  x^2 + $h0^2 = z^2
\]
Take time-derivatives of both sides of the
equation.  
\[
  2x\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 2z\dfrac{dz}{dt}.
\]
$PAR
Then plug in \( \dfrac{dx}{dt} = $rate\) and solve for
the unknown rate.
\[
  \dfrac{dz}{dt} = \dfrac{$rate x}{z}.
\]
$PAR
When \(x = 10\),
\[
  10^2 + $h0^2 = z^2 \;\Rightarrow\; z = \sqrt{$a1}.
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \dfrac{dz}{dt} = \dfrac{$num1}{\sqrt{$a1}}
  \approx $r1.
\]
$PAR
When \(x = 30\),
\[
  30^2 + $h0^2 = z^2 \;\Rightarrow\; z = \sqrt{$a2}.
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \dfrac{dz}{dt} = \dfrac{$num2}{\sqrt{$a2}}
  \approx $r2.
\]
