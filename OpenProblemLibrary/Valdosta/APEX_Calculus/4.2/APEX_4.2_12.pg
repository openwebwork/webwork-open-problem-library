A rope, attached to a weight, passes vertically up through a pulley
in the ceiling and then straight back down to a worker who holds the rope
in his hand.  The worker walks away at a constant rate [$rate] ft/s, keeping his hand at the same distance [$h0] feet below the ceiling.  How fast is the weight rising
when the worker has walked:

a. 10 feet? [__]{$r1} ft/s

b. 30 feet? [__]{$r2} ft/s

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When the worker has walked [`x`] feet his hand, the pulley, and the point 
[$h0] feet directly beneath the pulley form a right
triangle with height [$h0], base length [`x`],
and hypotenuse [`z`].  Let [`y`] be the distance
from the weight to the pulley.   The rate the weight rises 
equals the rate [`-dy/dt`] at which [`y`]  
decreases.  Also 
[```\  y+z = \text{length of rope} \ ```]
is constant (assuming the rope doesn't stretch and the worker doesn't let it slip through his hand) so 
[```\frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{dz}{dt}=\frac{d(\text{constant})}{dt} = 0```]
hence 
[``` -\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dz}{dt} ```]
is the answer that we seek.  

The values [`z`] and [`x`] are related by
the Pythagorean theorem
[``` z^2 = x^2 + [$h0]^2.```]
Differentiating, one obtains
[``` 2z\frac{dz}{dt} = 2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 0. ```]
The worker is walking away at the rate
[``` \frac{dx}{dt} = [$rate]\ \text{ft}/\text{s} ```]
so if [`x`] is known then one can compute 
[`z`] and [`dz/dt`]:   
 
When [`x = 10`],
[`10^2 + [$h0]^2 = z^2`] and so [`z = \sqrt{[$a1]}`]. Thus 
[```
  \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{[$num1]}{\sqrt{[$a1]}}
  \approx [$r1]\ \text{ft}/\text{s}
```]
in this case.

When [`x = 30`],
[`30^2 + [$h0]^2 = z^2`] and so [`z = \sqrt{[$a2]}`]. Thus
[```
  \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{[$num2]}{\sqrt{[$a2]}}
  \approx [$r2]\ \text{ft}/\text{s}.
```]
