BEGIN_PGML

A [$ladder] ft. ladder is leaning against a house while
the base is pulled away at a constant rate of [$spd] ft/s. At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the side of the house when the base is:

a)  [`\quad 1`] foot from the house?  [__]{$ans1} ft/s

b)  [`\quad 5`] feet from the house?  [__]{$ans2} ft/s

c)  [`\quad[$m]`] feet from the house?  [__]{$ans3} ft/s

*Warning:* Take care with plus/minus signs.  This problem asks for velocity in the downward direction.  Velocity downward and velocity upward have opposite signs because up and down point in opposite directions!

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Construct a right triangle with base [`x`] measuring
the distance from the house to the base of the ladder,
height [`y`] measuring from the ground to the top
of the ladder, and hypotenuse formed by the ladder
itself.  

As the ladder is pulled away [`x`] increases at the rate
[``` \frac{dx}{dt} = [$spd]\ \textrm{ft}/\text{s}. ```]

The problem asks for the rate sliding *down*, which is its velocity 
in the downward direction.  The derivative [`dy/dt`] measures its velocity in the upward 
direction so [`-dy/dt`] measures velocity in the *downward* direction.    
That's what we want.

The [$ladder] ft ladder forms the hypotenuse of the trangle so the Pythagorean Theorem says,
[```
  x^2 + y^2 = [$ladder]^2
```]

Take time-derivatives of both sides  
[```
  2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0
```]

Then plug in [`` \frac{dx}{dt} = [$spd]``] and solve for [`dy/dt`].
[```
  \begin{gathered}
    (2x)([$spd]) + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\
    \frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{[$spd] x}{y}
  \end{gathered} ```]  

In the questions we are given [`x`], so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for [`y`] (which is nonnegative in this problem)
[``` y = \sqrt{[$ladder]^2 - x^2} ```]
Plug this into the previous formula to obtain
[```-\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{[$spd] x}{\sqrt{[$ladder]^2 - x^2}}. ```]

Finally plug in the given values of [`x`] to obtain the answers.
