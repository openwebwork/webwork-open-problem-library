An aircraft is flying at [$spd] ft/s with an elevation of
[$elev] ft from the ground, on a straight-line path that will
take it directly over an anti-aircraft gun.  How
fast, in radians per second, will the gun have to turn
to accurately track the aircraft when the plane is:

a.  1000 feet away?  [__]{$x1} radian/s

b.  100 feet away?  [__]{$x2} radian/s

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Imagine a right triangle whose vertices are the gun, the aircraft, and the point on the ground directly below the aircraft. Let 
    [`x`] = length, in feet, of horizontal side  
    [`z`] = length, in feet, of hypotenuse = distance from gun to aircraft  
    [`\theta`] = angle at the gun   
The aircraft flies at constant elevation [$elev] ft above the ground so
    [$elev] ft = length of vertical side   
Its path will take it directly over the gun, so [`x`] must be 
decreasing at a rate equal to the speed of the aircraft 

    [``\frac{dx}{dt} = -[$spd]``]   
feet per second.  (Measure time [`t`] in seconds.)

We are given various values of [`z`] and asked to calculate [`d\theta/dt`].

How are [`x`],[`z`] and [`\theta`] related?  From trigonometry
[``` \begin{aligned}
        \tan\theta  &= \frac{[$elev]}{x} \\ 
         \cos\theta &= \frac{x}{z}
     \end{aligned} ```]
Differentiate the first equation with respect to [`t`] to obtain an equation 
relating derivatives
[``` \sec^2\theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\frac{[$elev]}{x^2}\frac{dx}{dt}   ```]
Plug [`dx/dt = -[$spd]`]  into this equation and solve for [`d\theta/dt`]
[``` \begin{aligned}
        \sec^2\theta \frac{d\theta}{dt}&= \frac{([$elev])([$spd])}{x^2} \\
       \frac{d\theta}{dt} &= \frac{[@ $elev * $spd @]}{x^2\sec^2\theta}
     \end{aligned} ```]

Now [`\ \cos\theta = x/z \ `] so [`\ \sec\theta = z/x \ `].  If one plugs that in the [`x`]'s cancel out! 
[```\begin{aligned}
       \frac{d\theta}{dt} &= \frac{[$num]}{x^2(z/x)^2}\\
           &= \frac{[$num]}{z^2}
     \end{aligned} ```]

a. If [`z = 1000`] then [`` \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{[$num]}{10^6} ``]  

b. If [`z = 100`], then [`` \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{[$num]}{10^4} ``]

in radians per second.
