Find the area of the region enclosed between 
 [` f(x) = [$f] `] and
 [` g(x) = [$g] `].

*Note:* The graph above represents both functions
[`f`] and [`g`] but is intentionally left unlabeled.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The top (blue) parabola is [`f(x)`], which can be determine either from the 
[`y`]-intercept which is greater for [`f(x)`].  Therefore, the area between curves is found using the 
definite integral 
[``` 
    \int_{a}^b \left( f(x) - g(x) \right) \, dx.
```]
First determine the points of intersection by
solving
[```
  \begin{aligned}
  [$g] & = [$f] \\
  [$fg_diff] & = 0 \\
  (x-[$a])(x-[$b]) & = 0
  \end{aligned}
```]
These points correspond to [`x = [$a]`] and [`x=[$b]`].
Then 
[```
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{Area} 
    & = \int_{[$a]}^{[$b]} \left( ([$f]) - ([$g]) \right) \, dx\\
    & = \int_{[$a]}^{[$b]} \left( [$fg_diff] \right) \, dx  \\
    & = \left( [$anti] \right)\bigg|_{[$a]}^{[$b]}\\
    & = [$F1] - \left( [$F2] \right) \\
    & = [$answer].
  \end{aligned}
```]
