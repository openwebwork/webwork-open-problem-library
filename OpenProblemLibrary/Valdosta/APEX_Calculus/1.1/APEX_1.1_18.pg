With 
[`` f(x) =  x^2 + [$b] x + [$c] \quad\text{ and }\quad a = [$a] ``]
and the given values of [`h`], approximate the limit of the difference quotient: 

[```
  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.
```]

a. When [` h = 0.1 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(0.1)}{10}

b. When [` h = -0.1 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(-0.1)}{10}

c. When [` h = 0.01 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(0.01)}{10}

d. When [` h = -0.01 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(-0.01)}{10}

e. Thus [`` \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \approx ``] [_____]{$limi->cmp(tolType=>"relative",tolerance=>0.001)}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Substituting in [`a=[$a]`], we get a table of values of the difference quotient 
[```q(h)=\frac{f([$a]+h)-f([$a])}{h}```] 
at points close to [`h=0`].
[@ DataTable([
        [ ['\(h\)', headerrow=>1], '\(q(h)\)' ],
        [ 0.1  , df(0.1)  ],
        [ -0.1 , df(-0.1) ],
        [ 0.01 , df(0.01) ],
        [ -0.01, df(-0.01)]
    ], horizontalrules=>1, texalignment=>"|c||c|"
) @]***
This enables one to estimate whether or not [`q(h)`] tends to a limit, and 
if it does, what the limit is.  As [`h`] approaches 0 from the left 
and right the values of [`q(h)`] seem to get very close together, which suggests that they are approaching a limit. The closest points [`h=[$xleft]`]
and [`h=[$xright]`] on the left and right sides of 0 produce values 
[`[$yleft]=q([$xleft])`] and [`[$yright]=q([$xright])`] that should be fairly good approximations of the limit.  

Usually one can get a somewhat better approximation by visualizing the graph of 
[`h`] based on the points in the table.

If the values of [`q(h)`] decrease as [`h\to 0`] on both the left and right sides of 0 then probably the limit is a little less than either [`[$yleft]`] or [`[$yright]`].  In that case the smaller of these two values should be closest to the limit.  

Similarly, if [`q(h)`] increases as [`h\to 0`] on both sides of 0 then   probably the limit is a little larger than either  [`[$yleft]`] or [`[$yright]`], so the larger of these values should be closest to the limit.

Thirdly, if [`q(h)`] increases as [`h\to 0`] in one direction, and decreases as [`h\to 0`] in the other direction, then one of the values   [`[$yleft]`] or [`[$yright]`] should be larger than the limit and the other should be smaller, so the limit ought to lie somewhere in the middle between them.  In that case the average [``\frac{[$yleft]+[$yright]}{2}``] of the two values ought to be closer to the limit than either of the two values alone.
