BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
A table of values of [`f(x)=[$f$]`] at points close to [$a]
[@ DataTable(
  [
    [ ['\(x\)',headerrow=>1] , '\(f(x)\)' , '\(x\)', '\(f(x)\)' ], 
    [ $a+.002 , F($a+.002) , $a-.002 , F($a-.002) ],
    [ $a+.001 , F($a+.001) , $a-.001 , F($a-.001) ],
    [ $a+.0005, F($a+.0005), $a-.0005, F($a-.0005)],

enables one to estimate whether or not [`f(x)`] tends to a limit, and 
if it does, what the limit is.  As [`x`] approaches [$a] from the left 
and right the values of [`f(x)`] seem to get very close together, which suggests that they are approaching a limit. The closest points [`x=[$xleft]`]
and [`x=[$xright]`] on the left and right sides of [`[$a]`] produce values 
[`[$yleft]=f([$xleft])`] and [`[$yright]=f([$xright])`] that should be fairly good approximations of the limit.  

Usually one can get a somewhat better approximation by visualizing the graph of 
[`f`] based on the points in the table.

If the values of [`f(x)`] decrease as [`x\to [$a]`] on both the left and right sides of [`[$a]`] then probably the limit is a little less than either [`[$yleft]`] or [`[$yright]`].  In that case the smaller of these two values should be closest to the limit.  

Similarly, if [`f(x)`] increases as [`x\to [$a]`] on both sides of [`[$a]`] then   probably the limit is a little larger than either  [`[$yleft]`] or [`[$yright]`], so the larger of these values should be closest to the limit.

Thirdly, if [`f(x)`] increases as [`x\to [$a]`] in one direction, and decreases as [`x\to [$a]`] in the other direction, then one of the values   [`[$yleft]`] or [`[$yright]`] should be larger than the limit and the other should be smaller, so the limit ought to lie somewhere in the middle between them.  In that case the average [``\frac{[$yleft]+[$yright]}{2}``] of the two values ought to be closer to the limit than either of the two values alone.  

Of course if one happens to know about continuous functions then one can avoid all this calculation and estimation by noticing that [`f`] is a polynomial, so it is continuous everywhere, so [`f([$a])`] is the exact value of the limit.  In real life, however, one often has only a table of values and no exact formula for 
[`f`], so approximate methods may be the best that are available.
