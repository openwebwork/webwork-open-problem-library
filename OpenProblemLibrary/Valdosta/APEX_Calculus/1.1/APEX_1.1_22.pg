With  [`` f(x) =  \sin x \text{ and } a = \pi ``]
and the given values of [`h`], approximate the limit of the difference quotient,
[``` \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}, ```]

a. When [` h = 0.1 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(0.1)}{10}

a. When [` h = -0.1 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(-0.1)}{10}

a. When [` h = 0.01 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(0.001)}{10}

a. When [` h = -0.01 `], [`` \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} ``] = [_]{df(-0.001)}{10}

a. So [``\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \approx ``] [_]{$limi->cmp(tolType=>"absolute",tolerance=>.0001)}{10}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Substituting in [`a=\pi`], we get a table of values of the difference quotient 
[```q(h)=\frac{f(\pi+h)-f(\pi)}{h}```] 
at points close to [`h=0`].
[@ DataTable([
     [ ['\(h\)' , headerrow=>1], '\(q(h)\)' ],
     [ 0.1  , df(0.1)  ],
     [ -0.1 , df(-0.1) ],
     [ 0.01 , df(0.01) ],
     [ -0.01, df(-0.01)] 
   ], horizontalrules=>1, texalignment=>"|c||c|")
@]***
This enables one to estimate whether or not [`q(h)`] tends to a limit, and 
if it does, what the limit is.  As [`h`] approaches 0 from the left 
and right the values of [`q(h)`] seem to get very close together, which suggests that they are approaching a limit. The closest points [`h=[$xleft]`]
and [`h=[$xright]`] on the left and right sides of 0 produce values 
[`[$yleft]=q([$xleft])`] and [`[$yright]=q([$xright])`] that should be fairly good approximations of the limit.  

Usually one can get a somewhat better approximation by visualizing the graph of 
[`h`] based on the points in the table.

In this problem the values of [`q(h)`] decrease as [`h\to 0`] on both the left and right sides of 0, so based on the evidence in the table the limit should be slightly smaller than  [`[$yleft]`].  

If one happens to know about differentiation then one can compute this limit exactly without a lot of computatious and approximations because the derivative [`f'(a)`] of [`f`] at [`a`] is the limit as [`h \to 0`] of the difference quotient at [`x=a`].  In this problem [`f(x)=\sin(x)`], its derivative is [`\cos(x)`], and [`a=\pi`], so the exact value of the limit is 
[```\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sin(\pi+h)-\sin(\pi)}{h} = \cos(\pi) = -1```]
