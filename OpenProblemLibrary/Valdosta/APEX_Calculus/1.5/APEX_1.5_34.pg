BEGIN_PGML
Let [`g`] be continuous on [` [[$a], [$b]] `], where 
[`g([$a]) = [$ya] `] and [` g([$b]) = [$yb] `].  

Does a value
[`[$a] < c < [$b] `] exist such that [` g(c) = [$L] `] ?

[__]{$ans1}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since [`g`] is continuous on [`[[$a],[$b]]`] and [`[$L]`] is strictly between [`g([$a])=[$ya]`] and [`g([$b])=[$yb]`] the 
intermediate value theorem *guarantees* that [` g(c) = [$L] `]
for some value [` x = c `] in the interval [` [$a] < c < [$b] `].
