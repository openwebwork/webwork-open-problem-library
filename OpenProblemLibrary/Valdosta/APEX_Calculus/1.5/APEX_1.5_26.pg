$a  = random(1, 10, 1);
$a2 = $a**2;

$answer = Compute("(-$a, $a)");

BEGIN_PGML
Let
[``
   g(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{[$a2] - t^2}}
``]    

Give the interval(s) on which [`g(t)`] is continuous. [__]{$answer}{20}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The radical is continuous on its domain:
[``` [$a2] - t^2  \geq 0 \;\Rightarrow\; t \in [-[$a], [$a]]```]

However [`h(t)`] is a quotient, and thus cannot be continuous at any [`t`]-value that would make its denominator zero. [```\sqrt{[$a2] - t^2} \neq 0 \;\Rightarrow\; t \neq \pm[$a]```]

Therefore, our final answer for the interval of continuity results from the exclusion of [`t = \pm[$a] `]: 
[```t \in (-[$a],[$a])```]
