Context("Numeric");

$e = random(1,3,1);
$e1 = Compute("32 * $e/10");

$a1 = random(2,4,1);
$a2 = random(5,10,1);

$ans1 = Compute("$a1 * $e1");
$ans2 = Compute("$a2 * $e1");

BEGIN_PGML
The distance, in feet, a stone drops in [`t`] seconds
is given by [`d(t) = 16t^2`].  The depth of a hole is to
be approximated by dropping a rock and listening for it
to hit the bottom.
Assume that time measurement is
accurate to [$e]/10ths of a second.
Use a linear approximation to estimate an upper bound for the propagated error if the measured time is:

a) At [`t=[$a1]`] seconds, the propagated error is at most  [_]{$ans1}{15} feet.

b) At [`t=[$a2]`] seconds, the propagated error is at most  [_]{$ans2}{15} feet.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
First find the differential of the equation [` d(t) = 16t^2`] and plug in the measured times and the error [`dt = \pm 0.[$e]`].
[```
 Â  dd
   = 32t \; dt 
   = 32t(\pm 0.[$e]) 
   = \pm [$e1] t
```]
Thus the propagated error after [`t`] seconds is at most [`[$e1]t`] feet. That is,
a) At [`t = [$a1]`], the propagated error is at most [`[$e1]\cdot [$a1] = [$ans1]`] feet.
b) At [`t = [$a2]`], the propagated error is at most [`[$e1]\cdot [$a2] = [$ans2]`] feet.
