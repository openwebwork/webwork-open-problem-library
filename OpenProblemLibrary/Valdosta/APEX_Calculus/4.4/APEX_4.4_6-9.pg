BEGIN_PGML

Use differentials to approximate the given
values by hand.  Provide 4 decimal
digits of accuracy.    

*Note:* 
Only use a calculator for routine arithmetic (addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division) as part of the 
approximation by differentials.
If you use your calculator to obtain a result directly
(for example, taking powers or roots), then your answer may
be different than the requested approximation.)

[` [$a1]^2 \approx `] [_]{$ans1}{10}

[` [$a2]^2 \approx `] [_]{$ans2}{10}

[` [$a3]^3 \approx `] [_]{$ans3}{10}

[` [$a4]^3 \approx `] [_]{$ans4}{10}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Use [`f(x) = x^2`] for the first two problems.  The
differential is: [`dy = 2x \; dx`].  Both [$a1] and [$a2]
are close to [$x1]. So to estimate the 
change in [`y`], use the approximation
[```
  \Delta y \approx dy = f'([$x1]) \; dx = 2([$x1]) \; dx 
  = [$f1] \; dx.
```]
Thus the first two answers are
[```
    \begin{aligned} 
      [$a1]^2 
      & = f([$x1]) + \Delta y \\
      & \approx [$x1]^2 + [$f1] ([$a1] - [$x1])\\ 
      & = [$x1s] + [$Dy1]
      = [$ans1]
      \\  
      [$a2]^2 
      & = f([$x1]) + \Delta y \\
      & \approx [$x1]^2 + [$f1] ([$a2] - [$x1]) \\
      & = [$x1s] + [$Dy2] 
      = [$ans2].
    \end{aligned}
```]

Use [`f(x) = x^3`] for the next two problems.  The
differential is: [`dy = 3x^2 \; dx`].  Both [$a3] and [$a4] are close to [$x2].  So to estimate the change in [`y`], use the approximation
[```
  \Delta y \approx dy = f'([$x2]) \; dx = 3([$x2])^2 \; dx
  = [$f2] \; dx.
```]
Thus the last two answers are 
[```
    \begin{aligned}
      [$a3]^3 
      & = f([$x2]) + \Delta y \\
      & \approx [$x2]^3 + [$f2] ([$a3] - [$x2]) \\
      & = [$x2c] + [$Dy3] 
      = [$ans3].
      \\
      [$a4]^3 
      & = f([$x2]) + \Delta y \\
      & \approx [$x2]^3 + [$f2] ([$a4] - [$x2]) \\
      & = [$x2c] + [$Dy4] 
      = [$ans4].
    \end{aligned}
```]
