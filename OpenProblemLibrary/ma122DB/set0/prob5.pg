Now that you have finished you can use the "Prob. List" button at the top of the page
to return to the problem list page.  You'll see that the problems you have done have been
labeled as correct or incorrect, so you can go back and do problems you skipped or couldn't
get right the first time.  Once you have done a problem correctly it is ALWAYS listed as correct
even if you go back and do it incorrectly later.  This means you can use WeBWorK to review
course material without any danger of changing your grade.
