BEGIN_TEXT

Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 
\(!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\) \(\textrm{cm}^3/\textrm{min}\) 
at the same time that water is being pumped  into the tank at a constant rate.  The tank has height \(!{$height:%5.1f} \ \textrm{m}\) and the the diameter at the top is \(!{$diameter:%5.1f} \ \textrm{m}\).  If the water level is rising at a rate of 
\( !{$levelRate:%5.1f} \ \textrm{cm}/\textrm{min}\) when the height of the water is \(! {$level:%5.1f} \ \textrm{m}\), find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic centimeters per minute.

$BR$BR
Let \(R\) be the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in.  Then you know that if \(V\) is volume of water, 
\(\frac{dV}{dt}=R-!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\).  Use geometry (similar triangles) to find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with base radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is given by \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \)
