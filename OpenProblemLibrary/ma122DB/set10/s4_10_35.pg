BEGIN_PGML
Consider the function [` f(x) `] whose second derivative is
[` f''(x) = [$a1] x + [$b1] \sin (x) `]. If [` f(0) = [$n1]`] and
 [` f'(0) = [$m1]`], what is  [` f(x) `]? 

[`f(x)=`]  [_]{Formula($antideriv)}{40}

END_PGML

Context('Fraction');
$coeff1 = Fraction($a1,2); 
$coeff2 = Fraction($a1,6);

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To solve this formula we will use the standard rule afor the antiderivatives
of a polynomial and the fact that the antiderivative of [` \sin `] is [` -\cos
`] while the antiderivative of [` \cos `] is [` \sin `].  Furthermore, we will
use the information given to us about [` f'(0) `] and [` f(0) `] to
eliminate any arbitrary constants.

Finding the general antiderivative of [` f''(x) `] gives a formula for
[` f'(x) `] as shown below:

[``` f'(x) = [$coeff1] x^2 - [$b1]\cos(x) + C_1 ```]

We are told that [` f'(0) = [$m1] `] so that we can solve for [` C_1 `] in the
expression above as shown.
[```
\begin{aligned}
f'(0) & = [$coeff1] (0)^2 - [$b1]\cos(x) + C_1 \\
[$m1] & = -[$b1] + C_1 \\
C_1 & = [$b2] 
\end{aligned}
```]

Therefore, the formula for [` f'(x) `] is: 

[``` f'(x) = [$coeff1]x^2 - [$b1]\cos(x) + [$b2]```] 

Now, we take the antiderivative of [` f'(x) `] to find the general formula
for the function [` f(x) `].

[```  f(x) = [$coeff2]x^3 - [$b1]\sin(x) + {[$b2]}x + C_2```] 

We are told that [` f(0) = [$n1] `] so that we can solve for [` C_2 `] as we
did for [` C_1 `] above.

[```f(0) = [$coeff2](0)^3 - [$b1]\sin(0) + {[$b2]}(0) + C_2 ```]
[```    [$n1] = C_2 ```]

Therefore, the specific value for the function [` f(x) `] is given by:

[```  f(x) = [$coeff2]x^3-[$b1]\sin{x}+{[$b2]}x+[$n1]```]
