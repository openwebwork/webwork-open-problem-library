# Now we do the randomization of variables, and other computations
# as needed for this problem.  Sometimes we compute the answers here.

$a = random( 1, 9);
$b = random(-3, 2);

$avg = ($a + $b) / 2;

BEGIN_PGML
What is the average of [$a] and [$b] ?

	Average = [_]{Real($avg)}{10}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The average of two values is the sum divided by 2.  In this case
[``` \frac{[$a]+[$b]}{2} = [$avg] ```]
