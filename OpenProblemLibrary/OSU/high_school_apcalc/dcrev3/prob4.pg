TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_TEXT
A certain magical substance that is used to make solid magical spheres
costs \($d1\) per cubic foot. The power of a magical sphere depends on its
surface area, and a magical sphere can be sold for \($d2\) per square foot
of surface area. If you are manufacturing such a sphere, what size should
you make them to maximize your profit per sphere?
$BR
\(r=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} ft.
$PAR
Note 1: the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere of radius
\(r\) are \(V=\frac{4\pi}{3}r^3\) and \(A=4\pi r^2\) respectively.
$PAR
Note 2: on a real exam you would be expected to justify that the answer
above is actually a maximum, rather than, say a minimum.
