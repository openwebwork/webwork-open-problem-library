BEGIN_TEXT
Some time in the future a human colony is started on Mars. The colony
begins with $a2 people and grows exponentially to $b2 in $c years.
$PAR
Give a formula for the size of the human population on Mars as a
function of \(t=\) time (in years) since the founding of the original
colony
$BR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Assuming the population continues to grow exponentially, how long will
it take to reach a size of $d2?
$BR
\{ans_rule(40)\} years
$PAR
What is the rate of change of the size of the population (measured in
people per year)
$e years after the
founding of the original colony?
$BR
\{ans_rule(40)\} people/year
