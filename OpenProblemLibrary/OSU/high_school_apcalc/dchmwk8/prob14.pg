TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_TEXT
The gasoline consumption in gallons per hour of a certain vehicle
is known to be the following function of velocity:
\[f(v) = \frac{v^3-$a v^2 + $b v}{150000}\]
What is the optimal velocity which minimizes the fuel consumption
of the vehicle in gallons PER MILE?
$BR
To solve this problem, we need to minimize the following function
of \(v\):
$BR
\(g(v) = \) \{ans_rule(35)\}
$BR
Hint for the above: Assume the vehicle is moving at constant velocity \(v\).
How long will it take to travel 1 mile?  How much gas will it use during that time?
$BR
We find that this function has one critical number at \(v=\)\{ans_rule()\}.
$BR
To verify that \(g(v)\) has a minimum at this critical number we compute
the second derivative \(g''(x)\) and find that its value at the critical
number is \{ans_rule()\}, a positive number.
