BEGIN_TEXT
Two people, $name1 and $name2, are racing each other.  Assume that both their
accelerations are constant, $name1 covers the last 1/$time2 of the race in $time1
seconds, and  $name2 covers the last 1/$time1 of the race in $time2 seconds.  Who
wins, and by how much?
$PAR

To answer this question, we need a formula for the time \(t\) it takes an
object accelerating from rest at a constant acceleration \(a\) to travel a
distance \(d\). This formula is
$BR
\(t=\) \{ans_rule(30)\} (Your answer should be an expression in \(d\) and \(a\).)

$PAR
Using this formula, we find that the time (in seconds) it takes $name1 to run the race is
\{ans_rule(35)\} and that the time it takes $name2 is \{ans_rule(35)\}.
Thus \{ans_rule(10)\} wins the race by \{ans_rule(35)\} seconds.
