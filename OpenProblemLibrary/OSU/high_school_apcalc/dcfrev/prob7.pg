A street light is at the top of a $pole ft pole.  A $girl ft tall girl
walks along a straight path away from the pole with a speed of $speed ft/sec.
$BR
At what rate is the tip of her shadow moving away from the light (ie. away
from the top of the pole) when the girl is $far ft away from the pole? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}$BR
How fast is her shadow lengthening? $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}$BR
