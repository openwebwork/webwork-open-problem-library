BEGIN_TEXT
A soda glass has the shape of the surface generated by revolving
the graph of \(y=$aa x^2\) for \(0\le x\le 1\) about the \(y\)-axis.
Soda is extracted from the glass through a straw at the rate of
\(1/2\) cubic inch per second. How fast is the soda level in the glass
dropping when the level is $bb inches? (Answer should be implicitly in units of
inches per second. Do not put units in your answer. Also your answer should be
positive, since we are asking for the rate at which the level DROPS rather than
rises.)
$BR

answer: \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
