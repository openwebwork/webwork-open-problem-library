## Set up the multiple choice structure

## What's the question to pose?
$question = "If \( T = T(t) \) represents the temperature of a (warm) object at time
\(t\), \(A\) represents the ambient (cool) temperature, and \(k\) is a negative constant of proportionality, which equation(s) accurately characterize Newton's law?";

## What's the answer?
$answer = "\( \frac{dT}{dt} = k (T - A) \)";

## Link the question and its answer
$mc->qa($question, $answer);

## What are some spurious answers?
$mc->extra('\( \frac{dT}{dt} = k (A - T)\)',
           '\( \frac{dT}{dt} = kT (1 - T/A)\)',
           '\( \frac{dT}{dt} = kT (T - A)\)'

## Some responses to tack onto the permuted list above

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

Newton's law of cooling says that the rate of cooling of an object is
proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object
and that of its surroundings (provided the difference is not too large).
