BEGIN_TEXT
A country has 10 billion dollars in paper currency in circulation, and
each day $daily_in million dollars comes into the country's banks.  The
government decides to introduce new currency by having the banks
replace old bills with new ones whenever old currency comes into the
bank.  Let \(x = x(t) \) denote the number of new dollars in
circulation after \(t\) days with units in billions and \(x(0) = 0\).
$PAR

$BBOLD A. $EBOLD Determine a differential equation which describes the
rate at which \(x\) is growing: 
$BR 
\(\frac{dx}{dt} = \)
\{ans_rule(60)\} 

$PAR 

$BBOLD B. $EBOLD Solve the differential equation
subject to the initial conditions given above.$BR
\(x(t) = \)\{ans_rule(60)\}
$PAR

$BBOLD C. $EBOLD How many days will it take for the new bills to
account for 90 percent of the currency in circulation?
\{ans_rule(20)\}
