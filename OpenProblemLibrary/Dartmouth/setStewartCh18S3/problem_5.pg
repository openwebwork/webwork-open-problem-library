BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose a pendulum with length
\(L\) (meters) has angle \(\theta\) (radians) from the vertical.
It can be shown that \(\theta\) as a function of time
satisfies the differential equation:

\[
    \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L} \sin\theta = 0
\]
where \(g = 9.8\) m/sec/sec is the acceleration due to gravity.  For
small values of \(\theta\) we can use the approximation \(\sin(\theta)
\sim \theta\), and with that substitution, the differential equation
becomes linear.
