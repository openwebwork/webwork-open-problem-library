BEGIN_TEXT 
A spring with a $m-kg mass and a damping constant $c can be held stretched
$x0 meters beyond its natural length by a force of $F0 newtons.  Suppose
the spring is stretched \{2*$x0\} meters beyond its natural length and
then released with zero velocity.

In the notation of the text, what is the value \(c^2 - 4mk\)?
\{ans_rule()\} \( \text m^2\text{kg}^2/\text{sec}^2 \)

Find the position of the mass, in meters, after t seconds.  Your answer
should be a function of the variable t of the form
    \( c_1 e^{\alpha t} + c_2 e^{\beta t}\)
where

$BR 
\( \alpha = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} (the larger of the two)$BR
\( \beta = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} (the smaller of the two)$BR
\( c_1 = \) \{ans_rule(60)\}
\( c_2 = \) \{ans_rule(60)\}
