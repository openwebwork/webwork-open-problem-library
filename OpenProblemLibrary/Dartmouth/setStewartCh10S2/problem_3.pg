BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

A cup of coffee at $initial_temp degrees Celsius is placed in a room
at $room_temp degrees Celsius.  Suppose that the coffee cools at a rate of
$cool_rate degrees Celsius per minute when the temperature of the
coffee is 70 degrees.  The differential equation describing this has the form
    \(\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-A)\), where
$BR
\( A = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}, and 
$BR
\( k = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}.
$BR

Either from drawing the direction field (try Maple or by hand) or
other intuitive means, 
$BR
the limiting value of \(T\) should be
\{ans_rule(20)\}
