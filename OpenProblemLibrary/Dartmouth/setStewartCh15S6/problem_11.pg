BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that you are climbing a hill whose shape is given by
\( z = $c - $a x^2 -$b y^2\),
and that you are at the point
($x0, $y0, 300).

$BR

In which direction (unit vector) should you proceed initially in order
to reach the top of the hill fastest?  
$BR 
\(\langle\)\{ans_rule(30)\},\{ans_rule(30)\}\(\rangle\) 

$BR If you climb in that direction, at what
angle above the horizontal will you be climbing initially (radian
measure)?  

$BR \{ans_rule(30)\}
