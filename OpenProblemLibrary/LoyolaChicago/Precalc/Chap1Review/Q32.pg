BEGIN_TEXT

A person's blood sugar level at a particular time of the day is partially
determined by the time of the most recent meal.  After a meal, blood sugar
level increases rapidly, then slowly comes back down to a normal level.
Sketch a person's blood sugar level as a function of time over the course
of a day.  Label the axes to indicate normal blood sugar level and the
time of each meal.
$PAR
Which of the graphs A-E below best represents a person's blood sugar level
as a function of the time of day?  Note the three black points included in
each graph denote the blood sugar level just prior to a meal.
