At the end of a semester, students' math grades are listed in a table
which gives each student's ID number in the left column and the student's
grade in the right column.  Let \(N\) represent the ID number and
\(G\) represent the grade of each student.

$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
Since each individual student can only have one grade in the class, this
means for each value of \(N\) there is exactly one value of \(G\)
assigned.  Thus \(G\) must be a function of \(N\).
$PAR
On the other hand, it is certainly possible that two different students
in the class earn the same grade.  This means it is very possible that
one given value of \(G\) is paired with two different values of \(N\).
If \(N\) is to be a function of \(G\), there could be only one possible
value of \(N\) for each value of \(G\). Thus \(N\) does not have to be
a function of \(G\).
