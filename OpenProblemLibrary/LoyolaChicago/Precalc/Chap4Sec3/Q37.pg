BEGIN_TEXT

The magnitude of an earthquake is measured
relative to the strength of a ${LQ}standard${RQ}
earthquake, whose seismic waves are of size 
\( W_0 \).  The magnitude, \( M \), of an 
earthquake with seismic waves of size \( W \) 
is defined to be \( \displaystyle M = \log_{10}
\left( \frac{W}{W_0} \right) \).  The value \( M \)
is called the Richter scale rating of the strength
of the earthquake.
$BR
$BR
(a) Let \( M \) and \( m \) represent the magnitude
of two earthquakes whose seismic waves are of sizes 
\( W \) and \( w \), respectively.  Using properties of 
logarithms, find a simplified formula for the
difference \( M - m \), in terms of \( W \) and 
\( w \).  
$BR
\( M - m = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}

(Enter ${BITALIC}log10${EITALIC} or ${BITALIC}logten${EITALIC} 
for the base 10 logarithm.)
$BR
$BR
(b) The 1989 earthquake in California had a rating 
of $cali on the Richter scale.  How many times larger
were the seismic waves in the March 2005 earthquake off
the coast of Sumatra, which measured $suma on the Richter
scale?
