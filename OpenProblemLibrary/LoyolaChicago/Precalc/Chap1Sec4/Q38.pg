BEGIN_TEXT

In a college meal plan you pay a membership fee, then all of your meals are at a fixed price per week.  If $x0 meals cost ${DOLLAR}$y0 and $x1 meals cost ${DOLLAR}$y1 , answer the following questions:
$PAR
a) Write a formula for the cost of a meal plan, $BITALIC C ${EITALIC}, in terms of the number of meals, $BITALIC n ${EITALIC}.
$BR
\( C = \ \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) What is the membership fee?   $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
c) What is the price per meal?  $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \} per meal
$PAR
d) Find the cost for $x2 meals.  $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
e) Find $BITALIC n $EITALIC in terms of $BITALIC C ${EITALIC}. $SPACE $SPACE \( n = \ \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
f) Finally, use your answer in part (e) to determine the maximum number of meals you can buy on a budget of ${DOLLAR}300.  Maximum number of meals implies if you find that $BITALIC n $EITALIC = 3.9, then you can buy a maximum of 3 meals.  You must truncate any decimal solutions (which is different from rounding).
$PAR
\( n = \ \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} meals

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) We are given two points on the line, ($x0, $y0) and ($x1, $y1).  We can compute the slope

\[ m = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta n} = \frac{$y1 - $y0}{$x1 - $x0} = $m \]

Then we use the point ($x0, $y0) to solve for the \(C\)-intercept \(b\), \( $y0 = $m ($x0) + b \) so \( b = $b \).  The equation is therefore \( C = $m n + $b \) .
$PAR
b) The membership fee is the amount a student is charged which is independent of how many meals they decide to include in their plan.  In other words, it this the cost if \( n = 0 \), or the \(C\)-intercept \(b = \)${DOLLAR}$b.
$PAR
c) The price per meal is how much the cost of the meal increases if a student adds one more meal onto their plan, which is the slope \(m = \)${DOLLAR}$m per meal.
$PAR
d) Using the formula from (a) \( C = $m ($x2) + $b = $y2 \) .  So $x0 meals will cost ${DOLLAR} $y2 .
$PAR
e) Rewriting our expression for the cost of a meal plan:
\[\begin{aligned} C &= $m n + $b,\\
              $m n &= C - $b \\
 n &= \frac{C - $b}{$m} \\
 & = \frac{C}{$m} - \frac{$b}{$m}
\end{aligned}\]
$PAR
f) Given \(C = \)${DOLLAR}300 you can buy:
\[ n = \frac{300}{$m} - \frac{$b}{$m} \approx $approx \]
$PAR
Since the college is unlikely to sell you a fraction of a meal, we round this number down.  Thus, $out is the number of meals you can buy for ${DOLLAR}300.
