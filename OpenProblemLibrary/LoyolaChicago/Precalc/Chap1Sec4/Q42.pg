BEGIN_TEXT

An empty champagne bottle is tossed from a hot-air balloon.  Its upwards velocity is measured every second and recorded in the table below:
$PAR
\{ begintable(7) \}
\{ row( "t (sec)", @t ) \}
\{ row( "v (ft/sec)", @v ) \}
\{ endtable() \}
$PAR
a) Find a formula for the velocity of the bottle as a function of the time since the bottle is tossed.
$BR
\( v = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
b) For each feature of the graph listed below, match one of the statments A-G which best explains its practical meaning.
\{ $ml -> print_q \}
\{$ml -> print_a \}

$PAR
a) The slope of the bottle is

\[  m = \frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{$v[1] - $v[0]}{1-0} = $m \]

and the \(v\)-intercept is $v[0].  Therefore the equation is \( v = $m t + $v[0] \) .
$PAR
b) The bottle travels upwards at first, and then begins to fall back to the ground.  As it falls, it falls faster and faster, meaning the slope gets more and more negative.  We saw in a) that indeed the slope is negative.  The slope gives the relationship between how a change in the input \(t\), time, affects the output velocity, \(v\).  Since the slope is $m, every second the bottle's velocity goes down by $disp_m feet.  The \(v\)-intercept is the value of \(v\), the velocity, when \(t\) = 0.  Therefore the \(v\)-intercept is the initial velocity of the bottle, $v[0] feet per second, when it is tossed upwards.  The \(t\)-intercept is the value of \(t\), time, when \(v = 0\).  If the velocity is 0 feet per second, this means the bottle is not going up or down, and this must be how long it takes the bottle to go up and reach its maximum just before the velocity becomes negative and the bottle begins to fall back down.
