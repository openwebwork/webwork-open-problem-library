BEGIN_TEXT

A weight is suspended from the ceiling by a spring.  Let
\(d\) be the distance in centimeters from the ceiling to the
weight.  When the weight is motionless, \( d = $m \, \mbox{cm} \).
If the weight is disturbed, it begins to bob up and down, or
${BITALIC}oscillate${EITALIC}.  Then \(d\) is a periodic function
of \(t\), the time in seconds, so \( d = f(t) \).  Consider the
graph of \( d = f(t) \) below, which represents the distance of
the weight from the ceiling at time \(t\).

$PAR
(b) The period of the graph is $b, therefore it takes the weight $b seconds to go through one full oscillation and return to its starting position.
$PAR
(c) The weight gets as close as $min cm to the ceiling.
$PAR
(d) The falls as far as $max cm from the ceiling.
$PAR
(e) The amplitude of the graph is the distance of the maximum (or minimum) \(y\) value from the midline.  In this case the midline is \(d=$m\) and the maximum value is \(d=$max\), so the amplitude is $a.
