BEGIN_TEXT

Let \( f(t) \) be the number of men and \( g(t) \) be the number of women
in Canada in year \( t \).  Let \( h(t) \) be the average income, in
Canadian dollars, of women in Canada in year \( t \).
$PAR
In this problem, you do not have explicit equations for the functions
\( f(t) \), \( g(t) \), or \( h(t) \), so you are not able to write explicit
equations to represent these functions.  Your answers should be expressions
obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and/or composing the
functions \( f(t) \), \( g(t) \), and \( h(t) \).
$PAR
(a) Find an expression for the function \( p(t) \) which gives the total
number of people in Canada in the year \( t \).
$BR
\( p(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}

$PAR
(b) Find an expression for the total amount of money \( m(t) \) earned by
Canadian women in the year \( t \).
$BR
\( m(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}

$PAR

(a) Since the population consists only of men and women, the
population size at any given time \( t \) will be the sum of the numbers
of women and the number of men at that particular time.  Thus \( p(t) =
f(t)+g(t) \).
$PAR
(b) In any given year the total amount of money that women in Canada
earn is equal to the average amount of
money one woman makes in that year times the number of women. Thus
\( m(t)=g(t) \cdot h(t) \).
