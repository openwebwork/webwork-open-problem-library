Many printing presses are designed with large plates
that print a fixed number of pages as a unit.  Each
unit is called a signature.  A particular press
prints signatures of $pagespersig pages each.  Suppose
\( C(p) \) is the cost of printing a book of \( p \)
pages, assuming each signature printed costs
${DOLLAR}${costpersig}.

$PAR

(a)
Each signature printed costs ${DOLLAR}$costpersig, and in a book
of \(p\) pages, there are at least \(p/$pagespersig\) signatures.
In a book of $pages pages, there are
\[ \frac{$pages}{$pagespersig}=$numsigs \hbox{ signatures},\]
\[\hbox{Cost for $pages pages }=$costpersig($numsigs)=$costpages.\]
A book of pages1 pages requires $numsigp1 signatures, although the
${numsig1}th signature is used to print only 1 page. Therefore, 
\[\hbox{Cost for $pages2 pages }=$costpersig($numsigp1)=$costpages1.\]
$PAR
To find the cost of \(p\) pages, we first find the number of
signatures.  If \(p\) is divisible by $pagespersig, then the number of signatures
is \(p/$pagespersig\) and the cost is
\[C(p)=$costpersig\left(\frac{p}{$pagespersig}\right).\]
If \(p\) is not divisible by $pagespersig, the number of signatures is \(p/$pagespersig\)
rounded up to the next highest integer and the cost is $costpersig times
that number.  In this case, it is hard to write a formula for \(C(p)\)
without a symbol for ``rounding up.''

$PAR
(b)
The number of pages, \(p\),
is greater than zero.  Although it is possible to have a page which is
only half filled, we do not say that a book has 124 1/2 pages, so \(p\)
must be an integer.  Therefore, the
domain of \(C(p)\) is \(p>0\), \(p\) an integer.  Because the cost of a book
increases by multiples of ${DOLLAR}$costpersig (the cost of one signature), the range
of \(C(p)\) is \(C>0\), \(C\) an integer multiple of ${DOLLAR}$costpersig.

$PAR
(c)
For 1 to $pagespersig pages, the cost is ${DOLLAR}$costpersig, because only 1
signature is required. For $pagespersigp1 to $twopagespersig pages,
the cost is ${DOLLAR}$twocostpersig, because 2 signatures are required. These data are continued in the table below, and plotted in the following figure,
for \(0\leq p\leq $pages\).
A closed circle
represents a point included on the graph, and an open
circle indicates a point excluded from the graph.  The unbroken lines
in the figure suggest, erroneously, that ${BITALIC}fractions$EITALIC of
pages can be printed.  It would be more accurate to draw each step as
$pagespersig separate dots instead of as an unbroken line.
