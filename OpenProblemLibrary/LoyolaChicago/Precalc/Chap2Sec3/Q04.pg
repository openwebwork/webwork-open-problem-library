Graph the piecewise defined function below. Use an open circle to represent a point which is not included and a solid dot to indicate a point which is on the graph.

After you have graphed the function on a separate piece of paper, indicate which of the graphs below matches the graph you sketched.  You should assume a graph continues on to \( \pm \infty \) unless it has an open or closed endpoint marked.

$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
Graph $ans is correct.
$PAR
Over the interval \(  x \leq 0 \) the graph is a parabola which continues on to \( \infty \) as \( x \rightarrow - \infty \) and stops at the origin (technically a closed point at the origin.
$PAR
Over the interval \( 0 < x < 4  \) the graph is \( y = \sqrt{x} \) which has open endpoints at the origin and at (4,2).  Notice the open endpoint at the origin overlaps the closed endpoint at the origin of the parabola.  Therefore the graph is uninterrupted at origin.
$PAR
Over the interval \( x \geq 4  \) we have the line \( y = x/2 \) which has positive slope and includes the left endpoint (4,2).  Since the closed point of this piece at (4,2) overlaps exactly the open right endpoint of the previous piece, the graph has no hole or jump at \( x = 4 \).  There is no endpoint on the right.  As \( x \rightarrow + \infty \), the graph goes up.
