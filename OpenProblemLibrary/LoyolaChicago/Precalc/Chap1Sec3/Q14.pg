$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a)  The slope of the function \(C\) can be calculated by using the formula
\[  m = \frac{ y_1 - y_0 }{x_1 - x_0} \]
for any pair of points $SPACE \( (x_0 , y_0 ) \)  and  \( (x_1 , y_1 ) \) in the table.  If we pick the pair of points ( $x[0], $c[0] ) and ( $x[1] , $c[1] ) ,
\[ m = \frac{ $c[1] - $c[0] }{ $x[1] - $x[0] } = $m \]
$PAR
b)  From (a) we know the slope of the line is $m .  If we increase the input by 100 to go from \(x = 100\) to \(x = 200\), we must therefore increase
the output by \((100)($m) = $up_out\).  The value at \(x = 200\) is
\( C(200) = C(100) + $up_out = $last \) .
$PAR
c) The fixed costs are the costs when no cups are produced (when
\(x = 0\)), or the vertical intercept.  The fixed costs for Company A are
\(C(0) = $c[0]\) while the fixed costs for Company B are \(F(0) = $d[0]\).
$correct1 pays higher fixed costs.
$PAR
d) The larger the slope, the steeper the graph of the line will be.  The slope of Company A is $m while the slope of Company B is $n.  $correct2 will have a steeper graph.
