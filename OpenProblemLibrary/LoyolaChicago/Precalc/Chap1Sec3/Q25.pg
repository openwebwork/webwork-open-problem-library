BEGIN_TEXT

A report by the US Geological Survey indicates that glaciers in Glacier National Park, Montana, are shrinking.  Recent estimates indicate the area covered by glaciers has decreased from over \( 25.5 \ \mbox{km}^2 \) in 1850 to about \( 25.5 \ \mbox{km}^2 \) in 1995.  Let \(A = f(t)\) give the area (in square km) \(t\) years after 2000, and assume \( f(t) = 16.2 - 0.062t \).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD

$PAR
a) The slope is \(m = 0.062\), which tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by \( 0.062 \ \mbox{km}^2 \) per year.  Since 1 km = 1,000 m, it follows that  \( 1 \ \mbox{km}^2 = 1,000,000 \ \mbox{m}^2 \).  Equivalently, the slope tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by \( 62,000 \ \mbox{m}^2 \) per year.

$PAR
b) The \(A\)-intercept is \(b = 16.2\), which tells us that in the year 2000, the area was \( 16.2 \ \mbox{km}^2 \).

$PAR
c) \(f( $q )\) is the amount of area in the park covered by glaciers in 2012 ($q years after 2000).  \(f(t) = $q\) signifies how many years after 2000 will the area covered by glaciers be \( $q \ \mbox{km}^2 \).

$PAR
d) We have \( f( $q ) = 16.2 - 0.062( $q) = $ans_d \)

$PAR
e) \( m = \frac{ \Delta A }{ \Delta t } = -0.062 \).  Letting \( \Delta t = $q \) we have \( \frac{ \Delta A }{ $q } = -0.062 \) , and therefore \( \Delta A = - $ans_e \).  So about $ans_e \(\mbox{km}^2\) disappear in $q years.

$PAR
f) We have \( 16.2 - 0.062 t = $q \), so that \( - 0.062 t = $diff \), and finally  \(t \approx $approx \).
