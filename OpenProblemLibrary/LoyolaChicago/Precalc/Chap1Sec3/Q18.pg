Steadia is an island which experienced approximately linear population growth from 1950 to 2000.  On the other hand, Randomian has experienced some turmoil more recently and did not experience linear nor near-linear growth.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) Notice the population of country $wrong does near-linear population growth from 1950 until 1980; however, the population actually decreases from 1980 to 1990, and then it rises significantly again.  Country $wrong cannot represent Steadia, it must represent the population of Randomian.
$PAR
b) On the other hand, the population of country $ans_a grows by $grow[0] million from 1950 to 1960, by $grow[1] million from 1960 to 1970, by $grow[2] million from 1970 to 1980, by $grow[3] million from 1980 to 1990, and finally by $grow[4] million from 1990 to 2000.  The population is growing by approximately $m million people every ten years, thus the rate of change is approximately \( \frac{$m}{10} = $n  \).
$PAR
c) The rate of change represents how much the population grows (in millions) every year.
$PAR
d)  If the population grows by $n million every year, then from 1980 to $year, the population has grown by approximately $SPACE \( ($point)($n) = $change \), and the population in $year is approximately \( $change + $line[3] \approx $pop \) .
