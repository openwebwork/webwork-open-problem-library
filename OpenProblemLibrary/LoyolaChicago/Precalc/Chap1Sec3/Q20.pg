BEGIN_TEXT

You bought a new car for ${DOLLAR}$b,500 in 2005, and the value of the car depreciates by ${DOLLAR}$m each year.  Find a formula for \(V\), the value of the car, in terms of \(t\), the number of years since 2005.

$PAR
The \(y\)-intercept is $c since the initial value of the car when you purchased it (i.e. when \(t = 0\)) was ${DOLLAR}$b,500.  The slope is -$m since the value goes down by ${DOLLAR}$m for every increase in \(t\) by 1.  Plugging these values into the general formula for a line \(y = mx + b\) yields the formula
\[ V(t) = $c - $m t. \]
