BEGIN_TEXT

A company finds that there is a linear relationship between the amount of money that it spends on advertising and the number of units it sells.  If it spends no money on advertising it sells $b units.  For each additional ${DOLLAR}$dx spent, an additional $dy units are sold. 
$PAR
a) If \(x\) is the amount of money that the company spends on advertising, find a formula for \(y\), the number of units sold as a function of \(x\).  (do not use commas in your formula).
$BR
\( y = \ \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
b) How many units does the firm sell if it spends ${DOLLAR}$x[0],000 on advertising? (do not include any commas in your answer)
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} units
$PAR
c) How many units does the firm sell if it spends ${DOLLAR}$x[1],000 on advertising? (do not include any commas in your answer)$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} units
$PAR
d) How much advertising money must be spent to sell 700 units? (do not include any commas in your answer)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a)  The slope of this line is \($dy/$dx = $m\), and the \(y\)-intercept is $b.  The equation is therefore \( y = $m x + $b \) .
$PAR

b) Substitute \(x = $x[0]000\) into the equation in part (a), \( ($m)($x[0]000) + $b = $y[0] \) .
$PAR

c) Substitute \(x = $x[1]000\) into the equation in part (a), \( ($m)($x[1]000) + $b = $y[1] \) .
$PAR

d) Set \(y = 700\) in the equation from part (a) and solve for \(x\),
\(700 = $m$ x + $b\).  Subtracting $b from both sides we obtain
\($show = $m$ x\).  Finally divide both sides of the equation by $m to
find \(x = $spend\) .  The company needs to spend ${DOLLAR}$spend on
advertising in order to sell 700 units.
