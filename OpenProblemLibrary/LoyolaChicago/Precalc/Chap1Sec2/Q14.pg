SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) The table gives the amount of calories used per minute.  So in order to find the total number of calories used in a half-hour, use the table to find the number of calories used by a $lbs[$i] who walks for a half-hour, and then multiply by 30 minutes.  Using the table we know a $lbs[$i] person walking uses $walk[$i] calories per minute; therefore,
\[ \mbox{ Total calories used } = ( $walk[$i] )(30) = $ans_a \mbox{ calories} \]
$BR
b) Using the same calculation as in (a), it follows that a $lbs[$j] person swimming uses $swim[$j] calories per minute.  Thus a $lbs[$j] person swimming for one hour uses a total of \( ( $swim[$j] )(60) = $swim_amt \) calories.  On the other hand, a $lbs[$i+1] person bicycling uses $bike[$i+1] calories per minute.  Thus a $lbs[$i+1] person bicycling for a half-hour uses a total of \( ( $bike[$i+1] )(30) = $bike_amt \) calories.  By comparing the values $swim_amt and $bike_amt we obtain the answer.
$PAR
c) Since the values in the table are increasing along the row of values corresponding to a person who is ${type[$pick]}, the number of calories of a person $type[$pick] increases as weight increases.
