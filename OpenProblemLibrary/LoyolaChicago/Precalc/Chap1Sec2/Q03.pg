BEGIN_TEXT

Based on the graphs of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) below, answer the following questions.  You should not approximate any of your answers.

a) What is the average rate of change of \(f(x)\) over the interval \( \ 2.2 \leq x \leq $x[$a] \ \) ? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) What is the average rate of change of \(g(x)\) over the interval \( \ 2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1 \ \) ? \{ ans_rule(20) \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The average rate of change of a function \( f(x) \) over an interval \( a \leq x \leq b \) is computed using the following formula:
\[ \mbox{Average Rate of Change of f(x) over } a \leq x \leq b = \frac{ \Delta f }{\Delta x} = \frac{ f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \]
$PAR

a) Using the formula above with the endpoints (2.2, 2.9) and ( $x[$a], $f[$a] ) we obtain the following answer:
\[  \mbox{Average Rate of Change of f(x) over } 2.2 \leq x \leq $x[$a] = \frac{ $f[$a] - 2.9}{$x[$a] - 2.2} = \frac{ $top_a}{$bottom_a} \]
$PAR

b) Using the formula above with the endpoints (2.2, 2.9) and ( $x[$a], $f[$a] ) we obtain the following answer:
\[  \mbox{Average Rate of Change of g(x) over } 2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1 = \frac{ 4.9 - 2.9}{6.1 - 2.2} = \frac{2}{$bottom_b} \]
