$PAR

a) Since \(P(t)\) has continuous decay, its formula will be \( P(t)=P_0e^{kt} \).  Since \( P_0 \) is the initial population, which is $p,000, and \( k \) represents the continuous growth rate of -$r${PERCENT}, our formula is
\[ P(t)= $a e^{$dec t}. \]
$PAR
b) Rewriting \( P(t)=$a e^{$dec t} \) in the form \( P=$a b^t \) will help us accomplish this.  Thus,
\[ P(t) = $a (e^{$dec})^t \approx $a ($b)^t. \]
After each year, about $left${PERCENT} of the population remains,
so the population decreases by approximately $ans_b${PERCENT} per year.
