The second best rate of return is Investment \{ $popup2->menu() \}

(a) For investment A, we have $show[0] dollars.$BR
For investment B, we have $show[1] dollars. $BR
For investment C, we have $show[2] dollars.
$PAR
(b) A comparison of final balances does not reflect the fact that the initial investment amounts are different.  One way to take initial amount into consideration is to look at the overall growth in the account.  Comparing final balance to initial deposit for each account we find 
\[\begin{aligned}
 \mbox{Investment A: } & \frac{$amt[0]}{$p[0]} \approx $quot[0] \\
 \mbox{Investment B: } & \frac{$amt[1]}{$p[1]} \approx $quot[1] \\
 \mbox{Investment C: } & \frac{$amt[2]}{$p[2]} \approx $quot[2]
\end{aligned}\]
Thus, in the two year period Investment A has grown by approximately $grow[0]${PERCENT}, Investment B has grown by approximately $grow[1]${PERCENT}, and Investment C has grown by approximately $grow[2]${PERCENT}.  The ranking the investments is thus Investment $ans[0] is the best, followed by Investment $ans[1], and the worst of the three is Investment $ans[2].
$PAR
Note:  Comparing the effective annual rates for each account would be a more efficient way to solve the problem and would give the same result.  In this case the effective annual rates for Investments A, B, and C are approximately $disp_r[0]${PERCENT}, $disp_r[1]${PERCENT}, and $disp_r[2]${PERCENT} respectively.
