$PAR
(a) Let \(x\) be the amount of money you will need. Then, at $r${PERCENT} interest, compounded annually, after $year[$i] years you will have the following dollar amount:
\[ x \left( 1+ $dec \right)^$t = x ($rd_b[0] )^$t.\]
If this needs to equal ${DOLLAR}$P_disp,000, then we have
\[ x($rd_b[0])^$t = $P, \]
or
\[ x = \frac{$P}{($rd_b[0])^$t} = $amt[0] \mbox{ dollars}. \]
$PAR
(b) Let \(x\) be the amount of money you will need. Then, at $r${PERCENT} interest, compounded monthly, after $year[$i] years you will have the following dollar amount:
\[ x \left( 1+ \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{12($t)} = x ($rd_b[1] )^$t. \]
If this needs to equal ${DOLLAR}$P_disp,000, then we have
\[ x($rd_b[1])^$t = $P, \]
or
\[ x = \frac{$P}{($rd_b[1])^$t} = $amt[1] \mbox{ dollars}. \]
$PAR
(c) Let \(x\) be the amount of money you will need. Then, at $r${PERCENT} interest, compounded daily, after $year[$i] years you will have the following dollar amount:
\[ x \left( 1+ \frac{$dec}{365} \right)^{365($t)} = x ($rd_b[2] )^$t. \]
If this needs to equal ${DOLLAR}$P_disp,000, then we have
\[ x($rd_b[2])^$t = $P, \]
or
\[ x = \frac{$P}{($rd_b[2])^$t} = $amt[2] \mbox{ dollars}. \]
$PAR
The effective yield on an account increases with the number of times of compounding.  So, as the number of times increases, the amount of money you need to begin with in order to end up with ${DOLLAR}$P_disp,000 in $t years decreases.
