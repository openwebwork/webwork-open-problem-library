What are the effective annual rates for an account paying an annual interest rate of $r$PERCENT which is compounded:
$PAR
(a) annually? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
(b) quarterly? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
(c) daily (assuming there are 365 days in the year)? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT
$BR
(d) continuously? \{ ans_rule(20) \} $PERCENT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) The effective annual rate for an account paying $r$PERCENT per year is $r${PERCENT}.
$PAR
(b) With quarterly compounding, there are four interest payments per year, each of which is \($r/4 = $quot[1]\)$PERCENT.  This occurs four times in one year, giving an effective annual rate of
\[ ($fact[1])^4 \approx $b[1], \]
which is $ans[1]${PERCENT}.
$PAR
(c) With daily compounding, there are 365 interest payments per year (assuming a non-leap year), each of which is \($r/365 = $quot[2]\)$PERCENT.  This occurs 365 times in one year, giving an effective annual rate of
\[ \left( 1+\frac{$dec}{365} \right)^{365} \approx $b[2], \]
which is $ans[2]${PERCENT}.
$PAR
(d) The effective annual rate for an account paying $r$PERCENT which is compounded continuously is
\[ e^{$dec} \approx $b[3], \]
which is $ans[3]${PERCENT}.
