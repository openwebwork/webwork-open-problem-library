$PAR

Let \(r\) represent the nominal annual rate.  Since the interest is compounded quarterly, the investment earns \( \frac{r}{4} \) each quarter. So, at the end of the first quarter, the investment is
\[ $p \left( 1 + \frac{r}{4} \right), \]
and at the end of the second quarter is
\[ $p \left( 1+ \frac{r}{4} \right)^2. \]
By the end of 10 years (or 40 quarters), it is
\[ $p \left( 1+ \frac{r}{4} \right)^{40}. \]
But we are told that the value after 10 years is $end, so
\[\begin{aligned}
 $end &= $p \left( 1+ \frac{r}{4} \right)^{40} \\
 \frac{$end}{$p} &= \left( 1+ \frac{r}{4} \right)^{40} \\
 \left( \frac{$end}{$p} \right)^{1/40} &= 1+ \frac{r}{4} \\
 $almost1 &\approx 1+ \frac{r}{4} \\
 $almost2 &\approx \frac{r}{4} \\
 r &\approx $almost3
\end{aligned}\]
We see that the nominal interest rate is about $r${PERCENT}.
