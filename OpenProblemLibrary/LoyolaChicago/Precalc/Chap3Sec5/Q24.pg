$PAR
If the investment is growing by $r$PERCENT per year, at the end of one year a ${DOLLAR}100 investment would be worth ${DOLLAR}$after1. At the end of two years, it will be worth \( ($after1)($b) = 100($b)^2 = $after2 \).  Similarly, after $t years the invest will be worth \( 100($b)^{$t} \), and it will have grown by a factor of \( ($b)^{$t} \approx $almost \).  Thus investment will have grown by about $ans${PERCENT}.
