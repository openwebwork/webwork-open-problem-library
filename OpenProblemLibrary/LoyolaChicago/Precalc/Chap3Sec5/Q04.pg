What is the balance after 1 year of an account containing ${DOLLAR}$P which earns a yearly nominal interest of $r$PERCENT that is compounded

(a) annually? $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}

(b) weekly (there are 52 weeks per year)? $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR

(a) If the interest is compounded annually, there will be \( $P \cdot $annual_b = $annual \) dollars after one year.
$PAR
(b) If the interest is compounded weekly, there will be $BR
\( $P \cdot \left( 1+ \frac{$dec}{52} \right)^{52} = $P \cdot $week_rd = $week \) dollars after one year.
$PAR
(c) If the interest is compounded every minute, there will be $BR
\( $P \cdot \left( 1+ \frac{$dec}{525,600 \cdot 100} \right)^{525,600} = $P \cdot $min_rd = $min \) dollars after one year.
$PAR
(d) If the interest is compounded continuously, after one year, there will be \( $P \cdot e^{$dec} = $contin \) dollars after one year.
