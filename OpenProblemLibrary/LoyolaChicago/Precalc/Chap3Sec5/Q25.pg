$PAR
If the annual growth factor is \(b\), then we know that, at the end of $t years, the investment will have grown by a factor of \( b^{$t} \).  But
we are told that it has grown by $r$PERCENT from its original amount.  So
\[ b^{$t} = $b_st, \]
or
\[ b = ($b_st)^{1/$t} \approx $almost. \]
Thus we know that it is growing by about $ans_r${PERCENT} per year.
