To determine concavity we calculate the rate of change: $BR
\[ \frac{\Delta f(t)}{\Delta t}   =  \frac{$y[1]-$y[0]}{$x[1]-$x[0]} $rater[0] \]
\[ \frac{\Delta f(t)}{\Delta t}   =  \frac{$y[2]-$y[1]}{$x[2]-$x[1]} $rater[1] \]
\[ \frac{\Delta f(t)}{\Delta t}   =  \frac{$y[3]-$y[2]}{$x[3]-$x[2]} $rater[2] \]
