When a drug is injected into a person's bloodstream, the amount of the drug present in the body increases rapidly at first.  If the person receives daily injections, the body metabolizes the drug so that the amount of the drug present in the body continues to increase, but at a decreasing rate.  Eventually the quantity levels off at a saturation level.  Let \(Q(t)\) denote the quantity of the drug in the body \(t\) days after receiving the first injection.

Since more and more of the drug is being injected into the body, this is an increasing function.  However, since the rate of increase of the drug is slowing down, the graph is concave down.
