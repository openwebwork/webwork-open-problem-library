BEGIN_TEXT

When a rumor begins, the number of people who have heard the rumor
increases slowly at first.  As the rumor spreads, the rate of increase
gets greater (as more people continue to tell their friends the
rumor), and then slows down again (when almost everyone has heard the
rumor).  Let \(N(t)\) denote the number of people who have heard the rumor
\(t\) hours after the rumor has begun.

The function is increasing throughout.  At first, the graph is concave up.  As more and more people hear the rumor, the rumor spreads more slowly, which means that the graph is then concave down.
