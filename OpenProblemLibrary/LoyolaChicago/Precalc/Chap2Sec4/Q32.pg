BEGIN_TEXT

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the US is given by \(G(t)\) where \(t\) is the number of years since 1990, and the units of \(G\) are billions of dollars.
Match the meaning of each of the mathematical expressions below with the
correct description below.

$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
\( G(11) \) is the output corresponding to the input of \( t=11 \). So \( G(11) \) represents the GDP for the year 2001 (11 years after 1990).
$PAR
The input to the \( G^{-1} \) function is billions of dollars, so its output is a time in years after 1990. Thus, \( G^{-1}(9873) \) represents the number of years after 1990 at which the GDP is 9873 billion dollars.
