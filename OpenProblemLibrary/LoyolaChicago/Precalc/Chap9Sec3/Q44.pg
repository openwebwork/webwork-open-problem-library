BEGIN_TEXT

You wish to pack a cardboard box inside a wooden crate.  In order to have room for the packing materials, you need to leave a \( $side \ \mbox{ft} \) space around the front, back, and sides of the box, and a \( $top \ \mbox{ft} \) space around the top and bottom of the box.
$PAR
If the cardboard box is
\( x \) feet long, \( (x+$w) \) feet wide, and \( (x-$h) \) feet deep, find a
formula in terms of \( x \) for the amount of packing material, \( M \), needed.
$PAR
\( M(x) = \) \{ans_rule(30) \}

$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
Let \( M \) be the amount of packing material you will need, then $BR
\( M = \left( \mbox{Volume of crate} \right) -\left( \hbox{ Volume of box} \right) = V_c-V_b \)
where \( V_c \) and \( V_b \) are the volumes of the crate and box, respectively. We have for the box's volume, \( V_b = x(x+ $w)(x-$h) \).
$PAR
The wooden crate must be \( $s2 \) ft longer than the cardboard box, so
its length is \( (x + $s2) \). This gives the required \( $side \) ft clearance
between the crate and the front and back of the box.  Similarly, the
crate's width must be \( $s2 \) ft greater than the box's width of \( (x + $w) \), and its depth must be $t2 ft greater than the box's depth of \( (x-$h) \).
$PAR
We have for the crate's volume
\[ V_c = (x+$s2)(x+$w+$s2)(x-$h+$t2) = (x+$s2)(x+$new_w)(x+$new_h). \]
Thus, the total amount of packing material will be
\[ M = V_c - V_b = (x+$s2)(x+$new_w)(x+$new_h)-x(x+$w)(x-$h). \]
$PAR
The formula for \( M \) is a difference of two third-degree polynomials.
The format is not terribly convenient, so we simplify the
formula by multiplying the factors for \( V_b \) and \( V_c \) and gathering
like terms.  Then for \( M \) we have
\[\begin{aligned}
M &= (x+$s2)(x+$new_w)(x+$new_h)-x(x+$w)(x-$h) \\
&= ( x^3 + $a[2] x^2 + $a[1] x + $a[0] )-( x^3 + $b[2] x^2 + $b[1] x) \\
&= $m[2] x^2 + $m[1] x + $m[0].
\end{aligned}\]
