The population of a colony of rabbits grows exponentially.  The colony begins with $p0 rabbits; $t1 years later there are $p1 rabbits.
$PAR
(a) Express the population of the colony of rabbits, \(P\), as a function of time, \(t\), in years.
$BR
\( P(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$PAR
(b) Use the graph to estimate how long it takes for the population of rabbits to reach 1000 rabbits. $BR
It will take \{ ans_rule(20) \} years. (round to nearest 0.01 year)

$PAR

a) Since the population grows exponentially, it can be described by \( P=ab^t \), where \(P\) is the number of rabbits and \(t\) is the number of years which have passed.  We know that \(a\) represents the initial number of rabbits, so \( a= $p0 \) and \( P= $p0 (b)^t \).  After $t1 years, there are $p1 rabbits so
\[\begin{aligned}
 $p1 &= $p0(b)^5 \\
 $quot &= b^5 \\
 (b^5)^{1/5} &= $quot^{1/5} \\
  b &\approx $b
\end{aligned}\]
From this, we know that \( P(t) = $p0($b)^{t} \).
$PAR
b) We want to find \(t\) when \(P=1000\).  Using a graph of \( P = $p0($b)^t \), we see (figure below) that the line \( P = 1000 \) and \( P = $p0($b)^t \) intersect when \( t \approx $ans_b \) years.
