$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a)  All of these constants must be positive.  The constants \(b, d\), and \(q\) must be positive since the base of any exponential function must be greater than zero.  The values of \(a, c\), and \(p\) all must be positive since all three of the graphs cross the \(y\)-axis when \(y > 0 \).
$PAR
b) Only the value for \($fact[0]\) must be greater than 1 since the graph of \( $lt[0] \) is increasing.  If an exponential is increasing, its base must be greater than 1.  None of the other constants MUST be greater than 1.
$PAR
c) The values for \($fact[1]\) and \($fact[2]\) certainly are between 0 and 1 since the graphs of \( $lt[1] \) and \( $lt[2] \) are decreasing.  In addition, it is possible that all of the \(y\)-intercepts are between 0 and 1.  They must be positive, and they may be greater than 1, but they do not have to be greater than 1.  Thus it is certainly possible that they are between 0 and 1.  Therefore the constants \($fact[1]\), \($fact[$perm[2]]\), \($init[0]\), \($init[1]\), and \($init[2]\) could possibly be between 0 and 1 (while in part (b) we already stated that $fact[0] > 1).
$PAR
d) The constant \($init[1]\) denotes the value of the \(y\)-intercept of the graph of \( $lt[1] \).  All we can definitely say about the value of \($init[1]\) is that it must be positive (as all of the constants must be), and it must be greater than the values of \($init[0]\) and \($init[2]\) since \( $lt[1] \) has a \(y\)-intercept which is higher than the \(y\)-intercepts of \( $lt[0] \) and \( $lt[2] \).  It is possible that all of the bases \($fact[0]\), \($fact[1]\), and \($fact[2]\) are greater than \($init[1]\).
$PAR
e) Since the \(y\)-intercepts of \( $lt[0] \) and \( $lt[2] \) are equal, we definitely know that \($init[0] = $init[2]\).
