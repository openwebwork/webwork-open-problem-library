Suppose \( y \), the number of cases of a disease, is reduced by $r${PERCENT} per year.
$PAR
(a) If there are initially 10,000 cases, express \( y \) as a function of
\( t \), the number of years elapsed.
$BR
\( y = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \} (do not enter any commas in your formula)
$PAR
(b) How many cases will there be $time years from now?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} cases.
$PAR
(c) How long does it take to reduce the number of cases to 1000?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} years

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) Since the number of cases is reduced by $r${PERCENT} each year, there are $neg_r${PERCENT} as many cases in one year as in the previous one.  So, after one year there are $neg_r${PERCENT} of 10,000 cases, or \( 10000($b) = $year1 \) cases, while after two years, there are \( 10000($b)($b)=10000($b)^2 \) cases.  In general, the number of cases after \( t \)  years is
\[ y=(10000)($b)^t. \]

$PAR
b) Setting \( t= $time\), we obtain the number of cases $time years from now
\[ y=(10000)\cdot(0.9)^$time \approx $ans_b \quad\mbox{or}\quad $b_round \mbox{ cases.} \]

$PAR
c) Plotting \( y=(10000)\cdot($b)^t \) and approximating the value of \( t \) for which \( y=1000 \), we obtain \( t\approx $ans_cr \) years.
