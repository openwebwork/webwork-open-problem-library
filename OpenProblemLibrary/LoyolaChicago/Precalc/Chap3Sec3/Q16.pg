BEGIN_TEXT

Let \( P=f(t) = $a($b)^t \) be the population of a community in year \(t\).
$PAR
(a) Evaluate \( f(0) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(b) Evaluate \( f(10) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} (retain at least 3 decimal places)
$PAR
(c) \{ $checkbox_mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $checkbox_mc->print_a() \}
$BR
(d) If the percentage growth rate remains constant, approximately when will the population reach $people people?
$BR
In \{ ans_rule(20) \} years (round to the nearest whole year).

$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) \( f(0)  = $a($b)^0 = $a \) , which means there are $a people in year 0.
$PAR
b) \( f(10) = $a($b)^{10} \approx $ans_b \)
$PAR
c) The answer to (b) means that in ten years the population of the town is about   $ans_b people, or the town's population in 10 years is about $b_round people.
$PAR
d) The graph of \( P=f(t) \) and \( P= $people \) intersect at \( t \approx $ans_d \). Thus, about $d_round years after \( t=0 \), the population will be $people.
