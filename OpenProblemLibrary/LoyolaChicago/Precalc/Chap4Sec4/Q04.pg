BEGIN_TEXT

You wish to graph the following relationship on a standard piece of paper:
$PAR
The number of tuberculosis bacteria in 20 different people,
some never exposed to the disease, some slightly exposed, some
with mild cases, and some dying of it.
$PAR
Should you use a logarithmic scale or a linear scale? \{ $popup->menu() \}
$BR
Be sure you can explain WHY you selected your scale.

$PAR
This should be graphed on a log scale.  Someone who has never
been exposed presumably has zero bacteria.  Someone who has been
slightly exposed has perhaps one thousand bacteria.  Someone
with a mild case may have ten thousand bacteria, and someone
dying of tuberculosis may have hundreds of thousands or millions
of bacteria.  Using a linear scale, the data points of all the people
not dying of the disease would be too close to be readable.
