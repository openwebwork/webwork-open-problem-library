A 30-second commercial during Super Bowl $roman[$i] in $yr[$i] cost advertisers
\( $price[$i] \)  million. For the first Super Bowl in 1967, an
advertiser could have purchased approximately \( $spot \) minutes of
advertising time for the same amount of money.
$PAR
(a) Assuming that advertising cost is proportional to its length of time,
find the cost of advertising, in dollars/second, during the $yr[$i]
Super Bowl.
$BR
cost = \{ ans_rule(20) \} dollars/second.
(round to nearest cent and do not enter commas)
$PAR
(b) Assuming that advertising cost is proportional to its length of time,
find the cost of advertising, in dollars/second, during the 1967 Super Bowl.
$BR
cost = \{ ans_rule(20) \} dollars/second.
(round to nearest cent and do not enter commas)
$PAR
(c) How many times more expensive was Super Bowl advertising in $yr[$i] than
in 1967?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(8) \} times more expensive (round to nearest whole number)

$PAR
(a) We assume that the cost, \( C \), in dollars, of a commercial is proportional to its length \( t \), in seconds, so \( C = k \cdot t\).  The constant \( k \) is the cost per second that we want.  In Super Bowl $roman[$i] in $yr[$i], the cost was ${DOLLAR}\($price[$i] \mbox{ million} =\)${DOLLAR}\($price[$i] \times 10^6 \) for \( 30 \) seconds, so \( $price[$i] \times 10^6 \) = \( k \cdot 30 \).  So \( k = \frac {$mil[$i]}{30} \approx $rd_a \mbox{ dollars/sec} \).
$PAR

(b) In Super Bowl I in 1967, for the same cost, ${DOLLAR}\( $price[$i] \) million, advertisers could buy \( $spot \) minutes \( = $spot \times 60 \) seconds.
\[  $price[$i] \times 10^6 = k \cdot $spot \times 60, \]
so
\[ k = \frac{$price[$i] \times 10^6}{$spot \times 60} \approx $rd_b \mbox{dollars/sec}. \]
$PAR

(c) The cost per second in $yr[$i] was ${DOLLAR}$rd_a and in 1967, it was
${DOLLAR}$rd_b. Thus the cost per second has increased by a factor of
\( \frac{$rd_a}{$rd_b} \approx $rough_c \).
$PAR
So cost has increased by a factor of about $rd_c.
