One of Kepler's three laws of planetary motion states that
the square of the period, \( P \), of a body orbiting the sun is
proportional to the cube of its average distance, \( d \), from the sun.
The Earth has a period of 365 days and its distance from the sun is approximately \( 93,000,000 \) miles.
$PAR
(a) Find \( P \) as a function of \( d \).

(b) The planet $planet[$i] has an average distance from the sun of
\( $mil[$i] \) miles.  How many earth days are in a $planet[$i] year -- in other words, what is the period of the planet $planet[$i]?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) Kepler's Law states that the square of the period, \( P \), is proportional to the cube of the distance, \( d \).  Thus, we have \( P^2 =k d^3 \).  Solving for \( P \) gives
\[ P= \sqrt{kd^3} = \sqrt{k}d^{3/2} = k_1 d^{3/2}, \]
where \( k_1 \) is now the constant of proportionality.
$PAR
For the earth, \( P=365 \) and \( d= 93,000,000 \).  Thus, \( \ 365 = k_1 (93,000,000)^{3/2} \ \), so \( \ k_1 = \frac{365}{(93,000,000)^{3/2}} = 4.1 \cdot 10^{-10} \).  This gives
\[ P = \frac{365}{(93,000,000)^{3/2}} \cdot d^{3/2} = 365 \frac{d^{3/2}}{(93,000,000)^{3/2}} = 365 \left( \frac{d}{93,000,000} \right)^{3/2} \]
or
\[ P=4.1\cdot 10^{-10}d^{3/2}. \]
$PAR

(b) For $planet[$i], \( d= $mil[$i] \) miles so we have
\[ P = 365 \left( \frac{$mil[$i]}{93,000,000} \right)^{3/2} \]
which gives \( P \approx $day \) earth days.
