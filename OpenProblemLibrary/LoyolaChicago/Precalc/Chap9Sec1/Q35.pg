BEGIN_TEXT
A group of friends rent a house at the beach for spring break for a total cost of ${DOLLAR}\( $k\). 
$BR
$BR
(a) Suppose all the members of the group pay an equal share of the total cost. Is the cost to each person directly or inversely proportional to the number of people sharing the house? Be sure you can explain your reasoning. \{ $popup->menu() \}
$BR

(b) Write a formula for the cost \( C \) per person as a function of the number of students who share the house, \( n \).

(c) How many people are needed to share the house if each student wants to pay a maximum of ${DOLLAR}\( $q \)?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) $SPACE The rent is inversely  proportional to the number of friends sharing
the house,  because as the number, \( n \), of friends increases, the amount each of them pays, \( C \), decreases. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) $SPACE Substituting the given values into the general formula \( C = \frac{k}{n} \), we get \( $k = \frac{k}{$num[$i]} \), so \( k=$price \)
and the formula is \( C = \frac{$k}{n} \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) $SPACE When \( C= $q \), we get \( $q = $k/n \), or \( n= $need \). Since each friend wants to pay a maximum of ${DOLLAR}\( $q \), it will take $ans_c of them.
