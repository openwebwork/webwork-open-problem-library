BEGIN_TEXT
Driving at $speed mi/hr, it takes approximately 3.5 hours to drive from Long Island to Albany, NY.
$PAR
(a) Is the time the drive takes directly or inversely proportional to the speed?  Be sure you can explain your reasoning.   \{ $popup->menu() \}
$PAR
(b) Write a formula for the proportion that represents the time the drive takes, \( h \) (in hours), as a function of your speed, \( v \) in mi/hr.
$BR
\( h(v) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
\{ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") \}
$PAR
(c) To get to Albany in 3 hours, how fast would you have to drive?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(15) \} (Include \{ AnswerFormatHelp("units") \} in your answer and round to three decimal places.)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) The number of hours is inversely proportional to the speed,  because
as the speed, \( v \), increases, the number of hours, \( h \),  decreases.
$PAR

(b) Substituting the given values into the general formula \( h= \frac{k}{v} \), we get \( 3.5 = \frac{k}{$speed} \), so \( k = $k \) and the formula is \( h= \frac{$k}{v} \).
$PAR

(c) When \( h=3 \), we get \( 3= \frac{$k}{v} \), or \( v= $rd_c \). So getting to Albany in \( 3 \) hours would require the speed of approximately \( $rd_c \) mph.
