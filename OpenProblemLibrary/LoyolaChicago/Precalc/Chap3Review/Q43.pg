\[ m = \frac{ \Delta f }{ \Delta x} = $m. \]
From this we can compute the value for \(b\)
\[ b = $y[0] - ($m)$x[0] = $int \]
Thus the equation for the line is \( f(x) = $m x + $int \).",

"Notice that when \( \Delta x = $dx_sm \), the ratio of consecutive values of the function is approximately $b, while when \( \Delta x = $dx_lg \), the ratio of consecutive values of the function is approximately $b_sq.  Although the ratio in consecutive function values is not constant, since the difference in consecutive \(x\) values is not constant either, this does not imply the function is not exponential.  When the change in \(x\) doubles, the ratio of consecutive values of the function is squared, \( $b_sq \approx ($b)^2 \).  So indeed there is a constant PERCENTAGE rate of change.  Using the ratio method along with the points ($x[0], $y[0]) and ($x[1], $y[1]) to compute the growth factor we get:
\[ b = \left( \frac{$y[1]}{$y[0]} \right)^{1/$dx_sm} \approx $b_eq. \]
From this we can compute the value for \(a\)
\[ a = $y[0] \cdot ($b_eq)^{-$x[0]} \approx $a. \]
Thus the equation for the exponential function is \( f(x) = $a($b_eq)^x \).",

"This function is neither linear nor exponential.  It seem as though it is exponential since the ratio of consecutive values of the function is constant, but since the change in \(x\) values is not constant, this is misleading.  When the change in \(x\) values doubles, the corresponding ratio should be squared since for example when \( \Delta x = $dx_sm \), it initially appears you multiply the functions value by a factor of $b.  So when \(x = $x[2]\), an increase in \(x\) of $dx_sm to \(x = $x_wr\) should lead to multiplying the value of the function at \(x = $x[3]\), $y[3], by a factor of $b_fake in order to get the point ($x_wr, $y[3]).  Then another increase in \(x\) by $dx_sm should lead to multiplying the value of the function at \(x = $x_wr\) by another factor $b_fake an thus the point ($x[3], $y_wr ).  However the value of the function at \(x = $x[3]\) is $y[3].  Although it appears to be, this function is not exponential.");

$PAR
If a function is linear, a constant change \(x\) will lead to a constant change in \(y\).  If a function is exponential, a constant change \(x\) will leads to a constant ratio in successive \(y\) values.  You need to be careful in checking the values in this table since the change in \(x\) values is not constant.  The change in the first three \(x\) values is $dx_sm, and then this change doubles to $dx_lg.
$PAR
Looking at the DIFFERENCE of consecutive terms we see:
$BR
\( f($x[1])-f($x[0])=$y[1] - $y[0] = $diff[0] \) with \( \Delta x = $dx_sm \)
$BR
\( f($x[2])-f($x[1])=$y[2] - $y[1] = $diff[1] \) with \( \Delta x = $dx_sm \)
$BR
\( f($x[3])-f($x[2])=$y[3] - $y[2] = $diff[2] \) with \( \Delta x = $dx_lg \)
$BR
\( f($x[4])-f($x[3])=$y[4] - $y[3] = $diff[3] \) with \( \Delta x = $dx_lg \)
$PAR
while on the other hand checking the RATIO if consecutive terms we see: $BR
\( \frac{f($x[1])}{f($x[0])}=\frac{$y[1]}{$y[0]} = $ratio[0] \)
with \( \Delta x = $dx_sm \)
$BR
\( \frac{f($x[2])}{f($x[1])}=\frac{$y[2]}{$y[1]} = $ratio[1] \)
with \( \Delta x = $dx_sm \)
$BR
\( \frac{f($x[3])}{f($x[2])}=\frac{$y[3]}{$y[2]} = $ratio[2] \)
with \( \Delta x = $dx_lg \)
