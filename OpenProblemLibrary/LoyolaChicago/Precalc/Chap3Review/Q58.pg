$PAR
Let \(r\) be the percentage by which the substance decays each year.
Every year we multiply the amount of radioactive substance by \(1-r\)
to determine the new amount. If \(a\) is the amount of the substance
on hand originally, we know that after $wd_time[$j] years, there have
been $wd_time[$j] yearly decreases, by a factor of \(1-r\). Since we
know that there will be $remain$PERCENT of \(a\), or \($b_long a\),
remaining after $wd_time[$j] years
(because $r$PERCENT of the original amount will have decayed), we know that
\[ a \cdot (1-r)^{$t} = $b_long a. \]
Dividing both sides by \( a \), we have \( (1-r)^{$t} = $b_long \),
which means that
\[ 1-r = ($b_long)^{1/$t} \approx $b \]
so \( r \approx $almost \) which is $ans${PERCENT} decay per year.
