$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
In general, at \(t\) years after 2005, the population in millions
is \( \ P = 36.8(1.013)^{t} \).
$PAR
(a) In $yr1, we have \(t = $t\), so \( P=36.8(1.013)^{$t} \approx $pop1 \)
million.  Therefore, between 2005 and $yr1, the population has increased
by about \( $pop1 - 36.8 = $diff1 \) million people.
$PAR
(b) In $yr2, we have \(t = $t2\), so \( P=36.8(1.013)^{$t2} \approx $pop2 \)
million.  Therefore, between $yr1 and $yr2, the population has increased by
about \( $pop2 - $pop1 = $diff2 \) million people.
$PAR
(c) The increase between $yr1 and $yr2 is expected to be larger than
the increase between 2005 and $yr1 because the exponential function is
concave up. Both increases are over $t year periods, but since the
graph of the function bends upward, the increase in the later time
period is larger.  Thus statements \{ $checkbox_mc -> correct_ans \}
are correct.
