BEGIN_TEXT

An account pays interest at a nominal rate of $r$PERCENT per year.
Find the effective annual yield if interest is compounded:
$PAR
(a) monthly? \{ ans_rule(30) \} $PERCENT
$BR
(b) weekly? \{ ans_rule(30) \} $PERCENT
$BR
(c) daily (assuming there are 365 days in the year)?
\{ ans_rule(30) \} $PERCENT
$BR
(d) continuously? \{ ans_rule(30) \} $PERCENT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) With monthly compounding, there are twelve interest payments per year, each of which is $r/12 = $quot[0]$PERCENT.  This occurs twelve times in one year, giving an effective annual factor of
\[ ($fact[0])^{12} \approx $b[0], \]
which corresponds to the effective rate of $ans[0]${PERCENT} each year.
$PAR
(b) With weekly compounding, there are 52 interest payments per year, each of which is $r/52 = $quot[1]$PERCENT.  This occurs 52 times in one year, giving an effective annual factor of
\[ ($fact[1])^{52} \approx $b[1],\]
which corresponds to the effective rate of $ans[1]${PERCENT} each year.
$PAR
(c) With daily compounding, there are 365 interest payments per year (assuming a non-leap year), each of which is $r/365 = $quot[2]$PERCENT.  This occurs 365 times in one year, giving an effective annual factor of 
\[ \left( 1+\frac{$dec}{365} \right)^{365} \approx $b[2], \]
which corresponds to the effective rate of $ans[2]${PERCENT} each year.
$PAR
(d) The effective annual factor for an account paying $r${PERCENT} which is compounded continuously is
\[ e^{$dec} \approx $b[3], \]
which corresponds to the effective rate of $ans[3]${PERCENT} each year.
