This problem is intended to clear up any confusion on how to enter answers for some of the problems in this assignment.  Recall there is difference between giving EXACT answers and APPROXIMATE answers.  One important fact to keep in mind as you enter exact answers in radians which involve the number \( \pi \), type $BBOLD pi $EBOLD in order to enter the exact value of \( \pi \).  WeBWorK reads pi as a number just as it does any other number.  So for instance \( 2 \pi \) can be entered as 2*pi, 2(pi), 2pi, pi+pi, ect.  When you want to approximate \( \pi \) on your calculator, on TI model calculators hit $BBOLD 2nd  and the $CARET key $EBOLD to get the value for \( \pi \).   Consider the following question:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
Determine the radian measure of the angle \( 60^{\circ} \): 
$BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE Enter the exact angle in radians: $SPACE $SPACE \{ ans_rule(20) \} $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE Enter an approximation for the radian measusre to three decimal places: $SPACE $SPACE \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$HR
Since the exact radian measure is \( \left( 60 \cdot \frac{ \pi }{180} \right) = \frac{\pi}{3} \), in the first box above you need to type $BBOLD $BITALIC pi/3${EITALIC}${EBOLD}, where pi is understood to be the number \( \pi \).
$BR
In the second box, you are asked to approximate the number \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) to three decimal places, so you should enter $BBOLD $BITALIC 1.047 $EITALIC $EBOLD $BR
$BBOLD KEEP THIS IN MIND AS YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN THIS SECTION. $EBOLD
