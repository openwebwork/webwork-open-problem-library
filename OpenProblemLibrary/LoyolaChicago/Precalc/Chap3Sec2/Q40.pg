BEGIN_TEXT
On November 27, 1993, the ${BITALIC}New York Times${EITALIC} reported that wildlife biologists have found a direct link between the increase in the human population in Florida and the decline of the local black bear population.  From 1953 to 1993, the human population increased, on average, at a rate of 8$PERCENT per year, while the black bear population decreased at a rate of 6$PERCENT per year.  In 1953 the black bear population was 11,000.

$BR 

a) Since the human population is growing by a certain percent each year, it can be described by the formula \( P=ab^t \).  If $BITALIC t $EITALIC is the number of years since 1953, then $BITALIC a $EITALIC represents the population in 1953. If the growth rate is 8$PERCENT per year, then the growth factor is \( b = 1+.08 =1.08 \).  Thus, \( P = a (1.08)^t \).  We know that in 1993 ($BITALIC t $EITALIC =40) the population was 13 million, so $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( 13000000 =  a(1.08)^{40} \) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( a = \frac{13000000}{1.08^{40}} \approx 598,402 \).
$BR
Therefore in 1953, the population of humans in Florida was about 600,000 people. 
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) In 1953 ($BITALIC t $EITALIC =0), the bear population was 11,000, so \( a=11,000 \).  The population has been decreasing at a rate of 6$PERCENT per year, so the decay factor \( b = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 \).  In 1993, $BITALIC t $EITALIC =40, so the population of black bears is $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( P=(11000)(0.94)^{40} \approx 926 \)
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) To find the year $BITALIC t $EITALIC when the bear population would be $bear, we set $BITALIC P $EITALIC equal to $bear in the equation found in part (b) and get an equation involving $BITALIC t $EITALIC: $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( P = (11000)(0.94)^t \) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( $bear = (11000)(0.94)^t \) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( \frac{$bear}{11000} = (0.94)^t \) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 
\( $quot \approx (0.94)^t \).
$BR
By looking at the intersection of the graphs \( P= $quot \) and \( P=(0.94)^t \), or by trial and error, we find that \( t \approx $check \) years.  Our model predicts that in $time years from 1953, which is the year $ans_c, the population of black bears would fall below $bear.
