Match each story with a formula.  Assume that the
constants [` P_0, r, b, A `] are all positive.

1. The percent of a lake's surface covered by algae, initially at 35%, was halved each year since the passage of anti-pollution laws. [_]{$dd[0]}

2. The amount of charge on a capacitor in an electric circuit decreases by 30% each second. [_]{$dd[1]}


3. Polluted water is passed through a series of filters.  Each filter removes all but 30% of the remaining impurities from the water. [_]{$dd[2]}

4. In 1950, the population of a town was 3000 people. Over the course of the next 50 years, the town  grew at a rate of 250 people per year. [_]{$dd[3]}

5. In 1950, the population of a town was 3000 people. Over the course of the next 50 years, the town  grew at a rate of 10% per decade. [_]{$dd[4]}
