The population of a town today is $a people.
$PAR
(a) If the population decreases linearly and the decrease is $r1${PERCENT} in the first year, what will the town's population be in 10 years?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(30) \} people. (Round to the nearest person and do not include commas in your answer.)

(b) If the population decreases exponentially at a rate of $r1${PERCENT} a year, what will the town's population be in 10 years?

$BR
a)  If the town's population decreases by $r1$PERCENT in the first year, it will decrease by $a - $a*($dec) = $m people.  If the town's population decreases linearly, then it will continue to decrease by $neg_m people each year, so in 10 years, the town's population will be:
\[ $a - ($neg_m)(10) = $ans1 \ \mbox{people}. \]
$PAR
b) If the town's population decreases exponentially by $r1$PERCENT a year, then each year $remain$PERCENT of the population remains.  After 10 years, the population will be:
\[ $a($b1)^{10} \approx $ans2 \ \mbox{people}.\]
