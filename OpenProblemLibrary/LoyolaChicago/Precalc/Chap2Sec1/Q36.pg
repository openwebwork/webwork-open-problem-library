BEGIN_TEXT

New York state income tax is based on taxable income which is part
of a person's total income.  The tax owed to the state is calculated
using taxable income (not total income).  In 2005, for a single person
with a taxable income between ${DOLLAR}20,000 and ${DOLLAR}100,000,
the tax owed was ${DOLLAR}973 plus 6.85${PERCENT} of the taxable income
over ${DOLLAR}20,000.  Answer the following questions, and DO NOT include
any commas in your final answers.
$PAR

(a) Compute the tax owed by a person whose taxable income is
${DOLLAR}$a_thou,000.
$BR
tax = ${DOLLAR}\{ ans_rule(15) \} (round to nearest dollar)
$PAR
(b) Consider a lawyer whose taxable income is $per${PERCENT} of her
total income, ${DOLLAR}\(x\), where \(x\) is between ${DOLLAR}60,000
and ${DOLLAR}120,000.  Write a formula for \(T(x)\), the amount of
taxable income (not the tax owed, yet).
$BR
\( T(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
(c) Write a formula for \(L(x)\), the amount owed by the lawyer in part
(b).
$BR
\( L(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
(d) Use \(L(x)\) to evaluate the tax liability (amount owed) for
\( x = $d_thou ,000 \) and compare your results to part (a).
$BR
\( L( $d ) = \) ${DOLLAR}\{ ans_rule(30) \} (round to nearest dollar)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) A person whose income is ${DOLLAR}$a_thou,000 will have to pay
6.85${PERCENT} of ($a_thou,000 - 20,000) = ${DOLLAR}$diff_a plus
${DOLLAR}973, so her tax owed is
\[ ($a_thou ,000 - 20,000)(0.0685) + 973 \approx $ans_a. \]
$PAR

(b) If her taxable income is $per${PERCENT} of her total income, then
\( T(x) = $r x \)
$PAR

(c) In order to find a formula for \(L(x)\) we take 6.85${PERCENT} of
\(T(x) - 20,000\) and add 973:
\[ L(x) = ( T(x) - 20,000)(0.0685) + 973, \]
or
\[ L(x) = ( $r x - 20,000)(0.0685) + 973. \]
$PAR
(d)
\[\begin{aligned}
L($d) &= ( $r ($d_thou ,000) - 20,000)(0.0685) + 973 \\
      &= ( $d_per ,000 - 20,000)(0.685) + 973 \\
      &= ( $diff_d,000 )(0.685) + 973 \approx $ans_d \mbox{ dollars}
