A ferris wheel is $diam meters in diameter and boarded at ground level.  The wheel makes one full rotation every $B minutes, and at time \( t = 0 \) you are at the $init[$j] o'clock position and $direct[$i].  Let \( f(t) \) denote your height (in meters) above ground at \( t \) minutes.  Find a formula for \( f(t) \).

$PAR
Since the diameter is $diam meters, your height would be $A meters when you are halfway up the ferris wheel, so the midline is \( y = k = $A \).  Your maximum height is $diam meters, so the amplitude is \( A = $A \).  The period is $B minutes, so the constant \( B = \frac{ 2 \pi}{$B} \).  At \( t = 0 \), the $init[$j] o'clock position would be halfway up the ferris wheel.  We want the graph to be at its midline when \( t = 0 \), so we want to use the sine function.  We also want the graph to begin $which[$i] at a first since the ferris wheel is $direct[$i], so we need to use a function of the form \( f(t) = $generic[$i] \):
\[ f(t) = $disp. \]
