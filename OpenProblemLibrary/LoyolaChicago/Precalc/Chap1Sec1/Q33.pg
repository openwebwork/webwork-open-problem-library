BEGIN_TEXT
Match each story about a bike ride to one of the graphs A - E, where the vertical axis, \(d\), represents distance from home, and the horizontal axis, \(t\), is time in hours since the start of the ride.  Enter the correct letter of the graph in the blank next to each corresponding statement. (A graph may be used more than once or not at all).

$PAR
The first story needs to be paired with a graph which has initial value $sol[0] .  Therefore the first story has graph $ans[0] .
$PAR
The second story needs to be paired with a graph which has initial value $sol[1] .  Therefore the second story has graph $ans[1] .

The third story needs to be paired with a graph which has initial value $sol[2] .  Therefore the third story has graph $ans[2] .
$PAR
The fourth story needs to be paired with a graph which has initial value $sol[3] .  Therefore the fourth story has graph $ans[3] .
$PAR
The last story needs to be paired with a graph which has initial value $sol[4] .  Therefore the last story has graph $ans[4] .
