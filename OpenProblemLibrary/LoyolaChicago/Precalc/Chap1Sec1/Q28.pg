BEGIN_TEXT
A bug starts out ten feet from a light.  It flies towards the light, then away from the light, then even closer than before, and next away from the light again.  Finally the bug flies towards the light, hitting the light, and flies off.  On a separate piece of paper, sketch a possible graph for the distance of the bug from the light as a function of time.  Be sure to label your axes.
$BR $SPACE $BR
Consider the five possible graphs below.  Which of these could also represent the bugs distance from the light (described above) as a function of time?  (click on each image to enlarge)
\{ begintable(5) \}
\{ row( @graph )  \}
\{ row( "1", "2", "3", "4", "5" ) \}
\{ endtable() \}
$BR
In the blank space provided below, enter the numbers of ALL possible graphs as a comma separated list.  There is at least one possible graph, and there may be more.    If for example you believe graph 1, graph 2, and graph 3 are all possible graphs of the distance as a function of time, in the blank below you could enter $BBOLD 1, 2, 3 $EBOLD or $BBOLD 2, 1, 3 $EBOLD or any other order of these three numbers.  The order you list your answers does not matter.
