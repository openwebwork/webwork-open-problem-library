BEGIN_TEXT 
The table below \(A = f(d)\), the amount of money \(A\) (in billions of dollars) in bills of denomination \(d\) circulating in US currency in 2005.  For example according to the table values below there were ${DOLLAR}60.2 billion worth of ${DOLLAR}50 bills in circulation.

a) Find \(f($d[$i]) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) Using your answer in (a), what was the total $BBOLD number of ${DOLLAR}$d[$i] bills $EBOLD (not amount of money) in circulation in 2005? $BR
There was a total number of \{ ans_rule(20) \} billion ${DOLLAR}$d[$i]  bills in circulation.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) \(f($d[$i]) = $f[$i]\) because when the entry in the top row is $d[$i] , the corresponding entry below it is $f[$i].
$PAR
b) The value $f[$i] from part (a) indicates the total value (in billions of dollars) of ${DOLLAR}$d[$i] bills in circulation, not the number of ${DOLLAR}$d[$i] bills.  The total number (in billions) of ${DOLLAR}$d[$i] bills in circulation equals the total value in circulation, $BITALIC f($d[$i]) $EITALIC = $f[$i], divided by $d[$i] (the value of each ${DOLLAR}$d[$i] bill):
\[ \frac{ $f[$i] }{ $d[$i] } = $b \mbox{ billion ${DOLLAR}$d[$i] bills}.\]
$PAR
c)  Using the same logic as in (b) calculate the number of each bill in circulation by finding the total value in circulation, \(f(d)\), and dividing by the value of the bill, \(d\).  Then compare the number of each bill in circulation, $SPACE \( \frac{ f(d) }{d} \) , for the given values of \(d\) in order to determine whether the statements are true or false.
