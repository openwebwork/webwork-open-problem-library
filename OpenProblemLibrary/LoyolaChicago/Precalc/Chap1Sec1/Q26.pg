Since Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile on May 6, 1954, the record has been lowered by over sixteen seconds.  The table below shows the year in which each new world record for the one-mile run was set and the times (in min:sec) of those records.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a)  NO.  Time is a NOT function of the input year.  For example, the input 1954 has two different outputs of time, $time[0] and $time[1].  There are also multiple outputs associated with the input years 1975 and 1981.
$PAR
b) YES. Year is a function of the input time.  A record can only be set once.  Thus given any record time, there is only one output value (year) which is associated with that particular time.
$PAR
c) In the expression \(y(\mbox{3:47.33}) = 1981\), the input 3:47.33 is the record time which was set during the output year 1981.
$PAR
d) \(y(\mbox{$time[$i]}) =  $year[$i]\).  Look for the input value $time[$i] in the table, and notice that the corresponding year next to it is $year[$i] .
