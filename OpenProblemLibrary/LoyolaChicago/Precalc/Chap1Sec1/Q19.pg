SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) The input $a_in corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM, and the output $a_out indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time.  Thus the mathematical expression \(f( $a_in ) = $a_out\) means there are $a_out people eating at 5:0${a_in} PM.
$PAR
b)   The output $b_out indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at a particular time (in minutes after 5 PM).  Thus the mathematical expression \(f(a) = $b_out\) means \(a\) minutes after 5 PM there are $b_out people eating.
$PAR
c)  The input $b_out corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM.  Thus the mathematical expression \(f( $b_out ) = b\) means there are \(b\) people eating at 5:${b_out} PM.
$PAR
d) The \(t\) corresponds to the time (in number of minutes past 5 PM), and the output \(n\) indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time.  Thus the mathematical expression \(n = f(t)\) indicates there are \(n\) people eating in the restaurant \(t\) minutes past 5 PM.  None of these statements explain this correctly, so the answer is None of the above.
