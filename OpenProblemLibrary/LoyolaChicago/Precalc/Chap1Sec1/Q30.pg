BEGIN_TEXT
The sales tax on an item is $r${PERCENT}.  Express the total cost, \(C\), in terms of the price of the item, \(P\).  Be sure to use the correct case of the variable when entering your expression.

$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
If the sales tax is $r${PERCENT}, then if you purchase an item which has price \(P\), the amount of tax you are charged for the item is \( P(0.0${r}) \) .  The total cost equals the cost of the item itself, which is \( P \) , plus the tax, which is \( P(0.0${r}) \).  Thus the total cost is
\[ C = P + P(0.0$r) = $b P \]
