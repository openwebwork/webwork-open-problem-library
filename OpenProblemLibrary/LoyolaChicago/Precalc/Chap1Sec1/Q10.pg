SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) When \( x = 0 \), the output is $f0 . You can use the table to determine this by first looking in the top row of \(x\) values and finding 0.  Next find the output of \(f(x)\) when \(x = 0\) by looking at the entry in the second row underneath the value 0.  In this case, the value in the second row under 0 is $f0 , thus \(f(0) = $f0\).
$PAR
b) The value(s) of \( x \) which have an output of 0 is/are \( x = $b\) . First look in the bottom row of output values for \(f(x)\) for all 0 entries.  Then look at the corresponding \(x\) values in the top row of the table above each of the entries in the bottom row which are 0.  In this case $num_b 0, and the corresponding $ent_b \(x = $b\).  
$PAR
c) When \( x = 1 \), the output is $f1 . Use the table to determine this by first looking in the top row of \(x\) values and finding 1.  Next find the output of \(f(x)\) when \( x = 1\) by looking at the entry in the second row underneath the value 1.  In this case, the value in the second row under 1 is $f1 , thus \(f(1) = $f1\).
$PAR
d) The value(s) of \( x \) which have an output of 1 is/are \( x = $d \). First look in the bottom row of output values for \(f(x)\) for all 1 entries.  Then look at the corresponding \(x\) values in the top row of the table above each of the entries in the bottom row which are 1.  In this case $num_d 1, and the corresponding $ent_d \(x = $d\). 
$PAR
You should note that it would be impossible for the answers to parts (a) and (c) to have more than one answer since \( f(x) \) is a function.  A function can not have more than one output for assigned to a single input.
