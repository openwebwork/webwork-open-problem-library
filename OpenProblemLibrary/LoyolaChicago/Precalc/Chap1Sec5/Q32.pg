BEGIN_TEXT

You want to choose one long distance telephone company from the following
options:
$PAR
Company A charges ${DOLLAR}$m dollars per minute (no fixed monthly charge).
$BR
Company B charges ${DOLLAR}$b per month plus ${DOLLAR}$n per minute.
$BR
Company C charges a fixed rate of ${DOLLAR}$c per month.
$PAR
Let \(A(x)\), \(B(x)\), and \(C(x)\) denote the monthly charges of Company
A, B, and C respectively for spending \(x\) minutes on long distance calls.
$PAR
(a) Find a formula for the monthly cost of using Company A, \(A(x) \):
$BR
\( A(x) \ = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(b) Find a formula for the monthly cost of using Company B, \(B(x) \):
$BR
\( B(x) \ = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(c) Find a formula for the monthly cost of using Company C, \(C(x) \):
$BR
\( C(x) \ = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(d) If you spend 125 minutes talking long distance in a month, which of the three companies will be cheapest?  Enter the letter (A, B, or C) here:
\{ ans_rule(5) \}
$PAR
(e) Given the graph below, match the number of each graph to corresponding
company it represents:
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($graph), width => 300, height => 300, tex_size => 700) \}
$ECENTER
$BR
\{ begintable(2) \}
\{ row("Company A", ans_rule(10) ) \}
\{ row("Company B", ans_rule(10) ) \}
\{ row("Company C", ans_rule(10) ) \}
\{ endtable() \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) If you use no minutes (when \(x = 0\)), the cost \(y = 0\).
So the \(y\)-intercept \(b = 0\).  Also, the slope is \(m = $m\)
since every time \(x\) increases by 1, your monthly cost increases
by ${DOLLAR}$m .  Thus the equation for company A is \( A(x) = $m x \).
$PAR
(b) The fixed monthly cost (if \(x = 0\)), is \(y = $b\).
So the \(y\)-intercept \(b = $b\).  Also, the slope is \(m = $n\)
since every time \(x\) increases by 1, your monthly cost increases
by ${DOLLAR}$n .  Thus the equation for company B is \( B(x) = $n x + $b \).
$PAR
(c) The slope is \(m = 0\) since the monthly cost is constant,
\(y = $c\).  The equation for company C is \( C(x) = $c \).
$PAR
(d)  If you use 125 minutes, then the monthly bill for Company A would
be \(($m)(125) = \)${DOLLAR}$q[0], the monthly bill for Company B would be
\(($n)(125) + $b = \)${DOLLAR}$q[1], and the monthly bill for Company C
is always ${DOLLAR}$c.  Since Company $least[$mark] charges
${DOLLAR}$q[$mark], it would have the cheapest monthly bill.
$PAR
(e) The blue, horizontal line 3 is the graph of Company C since its
graph has slope 0.  The green line 1 through the origin is the graph
of Company A's cost since Company A has no fixed monthly charge.  The
red line 2 is matched with Company B since company B has a positive
slope and a positive \(y\)-intercept.
