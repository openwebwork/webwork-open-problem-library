SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
Lines \(D\) and \(E\) have the same \(y\)-intercept, which is positive, and moreover must be 60 since they cross the \(y\)-axis at the highest value of the five lines.  Lines \(D\) and \(E\) must be matched with \( y = 60-x \) and \( y = 60 - 2x \).  Since \(E\) is steeper, it must have the more negative slope.  \( y = 60-2x \) must have graph \(E\) and \( y = 60 -x \) must have graph \(D\).
$PAR
Lines \(A\) and \(B\) have the same \(y\)-intercept, which is positive, and less than 60 since they cross the \(y\)-axis when \( y > 0 \) but lower than lines \(D\) and \(E\).  Lines \(A\) and \(B\) must be matched with \( y = 20+2x \) and \( y = 20+4x \).  Since \(A\) is steeper, it must have the greater slope.  \( y = 20+4x \) must have graph \(A\) and \( y = 20 +2x \) must have graph \(B\).
$PAR
Line \(C\) is the only line which has a negative \(y\)-intercept.  Similarly, the equation \( y = 2x -30 \) is only which has a negative \(y\)-intercept.  Thus \( y = 2x - 30 \) must have graph \(C\).
