The cost of a Frigbox refrigerator is ${DOLLAR}$b, and depreciates
${DOLLAR}$m each year.  The cost of an Arctic Air refrigerator is
${DOLLAR}$c , and it depreciates ${DOLLAR}$n per year.
$PAR
(a) Find an equation for the value of the Frigbox,
\(F\), \(t\) years after it is purchased.
$BR
\( F(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR

(b) Find an equation for the value of the Arctic Air,
\(A\), \(t\) years after it is purchased.
$BR
\( A(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(c) If a Frigbox and an Arctic Air are bought at the same time, when
do the two refrigerators have equal value?
$BR
In \{ ans_rule(20) \} years.

$PAR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a)  The equation for \(F(t)\) is a line which has slope \(-$m\) and
\(F\)-intercept $b, so its equation is \( F(t) = $b - $m t \).
$PAR
(b) The equation for \( A(t)\) is a line which has slope \(-$n\)
and \(A\)-intercept $c, so its equation is \( A(t) = $c - $n t \).
$PAR
(c) The two will have the same value when for the same value of \( t\),
\( F(t) = A(t) \):
\[\begin{aligned} $b - $m t &= $c - $n t \\
 $slope t &= $f1 \\
 t = $equal.
\end{aligned}\]
The two will have equal value in $equal years.
