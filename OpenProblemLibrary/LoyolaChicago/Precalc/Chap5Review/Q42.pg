SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) A box has 12 edges.  If it is cube-shaped, each edge has the same length.  If each edge has length $BITALIC x $EITALIC cm, then the total amount of tape needed to cover each edge would be \( L(x) = 12x \) .
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) \( L(x) - 6 \) is the amount of tape needed to cover the edges of a cube-shaped box with edges length $BITALIC x $EITALIC cm minus 6 cm.  Therefore you would have 6 cm less than the amount of tape needed to cover the edges of a box whose edges are length $BITALIC x $EITALIC cm.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) \( L(x-6) \) is the amount of tape needed to cover a box whose edges are length \( x - 6\) cm.  Therefore you would only have enough tape to cover the edges of a box whose edges are 6 cm less than a box with edges length $BITALIC x $EITALIC cm.
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) If you must wrap each edge beyond the corner for a distance of $d cm, this would be equivalent to the amount of tape needed to cover the edges of a box whose edges are length \( x + $d \).  Therefore the total amount of tape would be \( y = L(x+$d) \), which is a horizontal shift left by $d units.
