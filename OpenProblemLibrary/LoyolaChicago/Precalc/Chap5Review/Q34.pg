Let \( C=f(n) \) represent the total cost (in dollars) for a carpenter
when she builds \( n \) wooden chairs.
$PAR
(a) If the carpenter currently builds \(k\) chairs per week, what do
the following expressions represent?  Pick one (if any) of the statements
in each pull-down menu which best explains its significance.
$BR
(i) \( f(k+10) \) \{ $popup[0]->menu() \} .
$BR
(ii) \( f(k) + 10 \) \{ $popup[1]->menu() \} .
$BR
(iii) \( f(2k) \) \{ $popup[2]->menu() \} .
$BR
(iv) \( 2f(k) \) \{ $popup[3]->menu() \} .
$PAR

b) If the carpenter sells her chairs at $sell${PERCENT} above cost,
plus an additional $tax${PERCENT} sales tax on the sale price, write an
expression for her
gross income (including sales tax) each week.
$BR
Gross Income = \{ ans_rule(15) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) Each expression is explained below:
$PAR
(i) \( f(k+10) \) is the cost of building \( k + 10 \) chairs.  Therefore this expression represents the cost if she increases the number of chairs she builds in one week by 10.
$BR
(ii) \( f(k)+10 \) is ${DOLLAR}10 more than the cost of building \( k \) chairs.  Therefore this expression represents an increase in weekly cost by ${DOLLAR}10.
$BR
(iii) \( f(2k) \) is the cost of building \( 2k \) chairs.  Therefore this expression represents the cost if she doubles the number of chairs she builds in one week.
$BR
(iv) \( 2f(k) \) is twice the cost of building \( k \) chairs in one week.
$PAR

(b) If the carpenter builds \(k\) chairs in one week, the total
cost is \( f(k) \). Now, $sell${PERCENT} of the cost is
\( $dec_sell \cdot f(k) \), and therefore $sell${PERCENT} above cost
is \( (1+$dec_sell) \cdot f(k)= $coef_sell \cdot f(k) \).
$PAR
Tax on this amount is
\( $dec_tax\cdot $coef_sell \cdot f(k) \).  So, adding in the sales
tax we get a gross income of
$PAR
Gross Income = \( $coef_sell \cdot f(k) + $dec_tax\cdot $coef_sell
\cdot f(k) = $coef_sell\cdot $coef_tax \cdot f(k) \).
