Assume \( f(0)=1 \) is the normal level of oxygen.

$PAR
(a) A graph of \( f \) for \( 0 \leq t \leq 20 \) and \( 0 \leq y \leq 1.1 \) is shown in the figure below:
$BR
$BCENTER
$fig
$ECENTER
$BR
At \( t=0 \) the oxygen is at its normal level in the pond. The level
decreases sharply for the first week after the waste is dumped into
the pond. The oxygen level reaches its minimum of approximately
one half the normal level by the end of the first week. Then the
level begins to increase.
$PAR
(b) Eventually, the oxygen level in the pond will once again approach the
normal level of one.  This is visualized by the gray horizontal asymptote \( y = 1 \) in the graph above.
$PAR
(c) The line \( y= $dec \) is shown in figure above. After the level
has reached its minimum, we can approximate the intersection of \( f \)
and \( y= $dec \) at \( t \approx $ans \). Thus, it takes about \( $ans \) weeks for the level to return to \( $per \)$PERCENT normal.
