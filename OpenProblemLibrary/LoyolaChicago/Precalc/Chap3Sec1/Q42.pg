$PAR
The value of \( t_0 \) decreases.  To see this, notice that as \(a\) increases, the vertical intercept of \( f(t) = a(b)^t \) goes up, so the point of intersection moves to the left.  In other words, as \(a\) increases, the graph of \( f(t) \) $BITALIC catches up $EITALIC to the graph of \( g(t) \) earlier. If \(a\) rises as high as \(b\), the value of \( t_0 =0 \) because the two graphs intersect at the vertical axis.  If \(a\) rises higher than \(b\), the value of \( t_0 \) becomes negative, because the two graphs intersect to the left of the \(y\)-axis.
