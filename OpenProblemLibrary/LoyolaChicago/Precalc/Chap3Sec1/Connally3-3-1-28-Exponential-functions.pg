BEGIN_PGML

In the year [$startyear], a total of [$a] million passengers took a cruise vacation. The global cruise industry has been growing at [$rpercent]% per year for the last decade. Assume that this growth rate continues.

a) Write a formula for to approximate the number, [` N `], of cruise passengers (in
millions) [` t `] years after [$startyear].
  
    [` N = `][_]{$N}


b) How many cruise passengers (in millions) are predicted in the year [$endyear]?
  
    [` N = `][_]{$Nb}

c) How many cruise passengers (in millions) were there in the year 2000?
  
    [` N = `][_]{$Nc}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION


a) Since [`N`] is growing by [$rpercent][$PERCENT] per year, we know that [`N`] is an
exponential function of [`t`] with growth factor [`1 + [$r] = [$b]`].
Since [`N = [$a]`] when [`t = 0`], we have
[```
N = [$a]([$b])^t.
```]

b) In the year [$endyear], we have [`t = [$tb]`] and
[```
N = [$a]([$b])^{[$tb]} \approx [$Nb] \hbox{ million passengers.}
```]

c) In the year 2000, we have [`t = [$tc]`] and
[```
N = [$a]([$b])^{[$tc]} \approx [$Nc] \hbox{ million passengers.}
```]
