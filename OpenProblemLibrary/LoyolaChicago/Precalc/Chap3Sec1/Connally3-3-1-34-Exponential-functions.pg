SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR

$PAR
(a)
The amount of forest lost is $rp10$PERCENT of \($a\) million, or
\($r10 \cdot $a = $lost\) million hectares.

$PAR
(b)
The amount of world forest cover in \(2000\) is the amount in \(1990\)
minus the amount lost, or  \($a - $lost = $milleniumpop\) million
hectares.

$PAR
(c)
Let \(f(t)\) represent the number of million hectares
of natural forest in the world \(t\) years after \(1990\).  Since
\(f(0) = $a\) and we are assuming exponential decay, we have
\(f(t) = $a\,b^t\) for some base \(b\).  Since \($rp10\)$PERCENT decayed over a
10-year period, we know that \(1 $r10 = $b10\) was the growth
factor for the 10-year period.  We have
\[\begin{aligned}
b^{10} &= $b10\\
b &= ($b10)^{1/10}.
\end{aligned}\]
The formula is \(f(t) = $a \left(($b10)^{1/10}\right)^t \approx $a($b1r)^t\).

$PAR
(d)
The annual growth factor is \($r1r = 1 - $b1r\) so the world
forest cover decreased at a rate of \($rp1r\)$PERCENT per year during the
years \(1990 - 2000.\)
