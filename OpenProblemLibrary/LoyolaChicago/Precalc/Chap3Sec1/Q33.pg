Polluted water is passed through a series of filters.  Each filter
removes $r$PERCENT of the remaining impurities.  Initially, the untreated
water contains impurities at a level of  $a parts per million (ppm).
Find a formula for  $BITALIC L${EITALIC}, the remaining level of impurities, after the water has been passed through a series of  $BITALIC n $EITALIC filters.

$PAR
Since each filter removes $r${PERCENT} of the remaining impurities, the growth rate of change of the impurity level is \(r = - $decimal\) per filter.  Thus, the growth factor is \( b = 1 + r = 1 - $decimal = $b\).  This means that each time the water is passed through a filter, the impurity level \(L\) is multiplied by a factor of $b.  This makes sense, because if each filter removes $r${PERCENT}, there remains $r_left${PERCENT} of the impurities.  We see that a formula for \(L\) is
\[ L(n) = $a($b)^n \]
because after being passed through \(n\) filters, the impurity level will have been multiplied by a factor of $b a total of \(n\) times.
