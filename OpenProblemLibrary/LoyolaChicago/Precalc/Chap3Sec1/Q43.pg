The value of \( t_0 \) decreases.  To see that, notice that if \(d\) is decreased, the graph of \( g(t) = c(d)^t \) climbs more slowly, and eventually (if \(d\) falls below 1) begins to fall. Thus the point of intersection moves to the left, so \( t_0 \) goes down.  However, since the graph of \( g(t) \) intersects the vertical axis above the graph of \( f(t) \), \( t_0 \) remains positive no matter how small \(d\) becomes, so long as \( d >0 \). (Recall that the base of an exponential function must be positive.)
