$PAR
If an investment decreases by $r$PERCENT each year, we know that only $rate_remain$PERCENT remains at the end of one year.  After 2 years there will be $rate_remain$PERCENT of $rate_remain$PERCENT or \( $decimal^2 \) left.  After $year years, there will be \( $decimal^$year \approx $factor \) or $almost_rate$PERCENT of the investment left.  Thus the investment decays by $total_disp${PERCENT}.
