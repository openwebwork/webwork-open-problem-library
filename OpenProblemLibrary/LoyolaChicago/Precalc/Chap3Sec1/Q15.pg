$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
The expressions \( $low ($low_high)^t \) and \( $low ($low_low)^t \) both have $BITALIC a $EITALIC = $low (the lowest of three $BITALIC a $EITALIC values), so they must have the lowest $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept.   These two expressions must be paired with graphs I (red) and III (blue).  Since \( $low_high > $low_low \), the graph of \( $low ($low_high)^t \) has a greater growth rate, and its graph must be I since I increases much steeper than III.  Therefore \( $low ($low_low)^t \) has graph III.
$BR $SPACE $BR
The expressions \( $high ($high_high)^t \), $SPACE \( $high ($high_mid)^t \), $SPACE and \( $high ($high_low)^t \) all have $BITALIC a $EITALIC = $high (the highest of three $BITALIC a $EITALIC values), so they must have the highest $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept.   These three expressions must be paired with graphs IV (yellow), V (black), and VI (orange).  Of these three, only one has a growth factor greater than 1, $BITALIC b $EITALIC= $high_high, and thus \( $high ($high_high)^t \) has graph IV.  Since \( $high_low < $high_mid \) the graph of \( $high ($high_low)^t \) must decay faster, and its graph must be VI.  This leaves \( $high ($high_mid)^t \) to have graph V.
$BR $SPACE $BR
The only remaining expression, \( $mid ($low_low)^t \), is matched with graph II (green) since its $BITALIC a $EITALIC = $mid falls between the $BITALIC a $EITALIC values of the other expressions.  Its $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercept therefore must be between the $BITALIC y${EITALIC}-intercepts of the other graphs.
