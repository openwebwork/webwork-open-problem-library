Every year a lake becomes more polluted, and $r$PERCENT fewer organisms can live in it.  If in 2010 there are $number[$i] million organisms, write an equation relating \(N\), the number of organisms (in millions), to time \(t\), in years since 2010.

$BR
In year \(t =0\), there are $number[$i] million organisms, which we take as our initial value.  Our growth/decay factor is $b, for a decay of $decimal${PERCENT} per year.  Thus
\( N(t) = $a($b)^t \).
