$BR

a) The initial dose equals the amount of drug in the body when $BITALIC t $EITALIC =0 . We have \( A(0) = $a($b)^0= $a (1) = $a \ \mbox{mg} \).
$PAR
b) According to the formula,
\[\begin{aligned}
 A(0) &= $a ($b)^0= $a \\
 A(1) &= $a ($b)^1= $a($b) \\
 A(2) &= $a ($b)^2= $a($b)($b)
\end{aligned}\]
The amount of the drug in the body at the end of each hour is the amount at the end of the previous hour multiplied by $b.  In other words, the amount remaining is $rate_left$PERCENT of what it had been an hour ago.  So, $r$PERCENT of the drug has left in that time.
$PAR
c) After $hr hours, \( t = $hr\) and  \( A($hr) = $disp_amt \  \mbox{mg} \).
