$BR
The graph of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} + $a \) is the graph \( y = \frac{1}{x^2} \) which has been shifted down by $pos_a units.  Its graph is drawn below:
$BR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($graph), width => 200, height => 200, tex_size => 700) \}
$ECENTER
$BR
The domain is all real numbers but \( x = 0 \), which in interval notation is \( ( - \infty , 0) (0, + \infty) \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
The range is  \( ( $a , + \infty ) \).  Notice as $BITALIC x $EITALIC goes to \( \pm \infty \), the graph approaches the line \( y = $a \) but never actually hits it.  It gets closer and closer as you keep going out further to the left and right.  As \( x \) gets closer to zero, the value of $BITALIC f(x) $EITALIC gets very large, and in fact goes to \( + \infty \).   This is because when the denominator of a fraction is very small, the value of that function is very large.  The upper limit of the range is therefore \( + \infty \) (which is never included).
