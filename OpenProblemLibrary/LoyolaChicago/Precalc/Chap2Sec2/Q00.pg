BEGIN_TEXT
In order to help you enter your answers in interval notation throughout this assignment, note the following:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE If you wish to enter \( - \infty \) you need to type - infinity.
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE If you wish to enter \( + \infty \) you need to type infinity.
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE Use round parentheses ( or ) to exclude endpoints of intervals.
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE Use square brackets [ or ] to include endpoints of intervals.
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE Use curly braces {5} to include a singleton (such as include the number 5 alone).
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE Use the letter U when using two or more intervals in a single answer .
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE Always use ( or ) with infinity or -infinity.
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE There is some flexibility in how WeBWorK reads these answers, for example you could enter (-ininity,2)U(2,+infinity) or (- INFINITY , 2 ) u   ( 2 , INFINITY ) and WeBWorK interprets these to expressions as being equivalent.
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
* $SPACE The variable which the interval is referring to is implied in the context of the question.  Entering the domain is x $SPACE \( \ge \) $SPACE 5 or the range is y $SPACE \( \ge \) $SPACE 5 would both be entered in either context as [5, infinity).
$BR
$HR
$BR
Here is an example to practice before moving on to the questions in this assignment.  
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
Let $SPACE \( f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \) 
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
a) State the domain of $BITALIC f(x) $EITALIC : \{ ans_rule(20) \} $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE \{ AnswerFormatHelp("intervals") \} 
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
b) State the range of $BITALIC f(x) $EITALIC : \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
You should recall the denominator of a fraction can't be zero, so the domain is all real numbers \( x \ne 2 \).  The range will be \( y > 0\).  These two answers in interval notation would be answered respectively as $BBOLD (-infinity, 2) U (2, infinity)$EBOLD and $BBOLD (0, infinity)${EBOLD}.  Be sure you are able to enter these answers properly above before trying to enter the rest of your answers.
