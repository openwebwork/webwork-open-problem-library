$PAR
(a)
Since the function is approximately linear, its equation is
\(c=b+mw\), where \(c\) is the number of calories and \(w\) is
weight. One can estimate the slope using any pair of values in the table; 
because the function is approximately linear the estimates all turn out to be about the same.  For example, using the first and last values in the table we obtain the 
estimate 
\[ m\approx \frac{5.9-2.7}{220-100}=\frac{3.2}{120}\approx 0.027\hbox{ cal/lb.}\]
Then plug in one of the points, say the middle one \((150,4)\), to estimate the C-intercept \(b\) 
\[\begin{aligned}
4 &\approx b+ 0.027(150)\\
  b &\approx -0.05.
\end{aligned}\]
which is pretty close to 0.  Plugging in the other points we find that all the estimates for \(b\) are approximately zero, so let's just say 
\(b \approx 0\), so the equation  
\(c=0.027w\) is a pretty good approximation of the solution.

Using more advanced methods (linear regression) one can get a "better" estimate  \(c \approx -0.017+0.027*w\) but the data aren't precise enough to justify such a 
a precise answer.

$PAR
(b) Since the function obtained in (a) relies on data for
\(100\le w\le 200\), a meaningful domain is this range of \(w\)
values.

$PAR
(c) The corresponding range for this function is \(0\le c\le 6\).

$PAR
(d) To find the calories per minute that are used by a person who
weighs $wt pounds, we evaluate the function in (a) at \(w = $wt\):
\[ c \approx 0.027 ( $wt ) \approx $cw. \]
