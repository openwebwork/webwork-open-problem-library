SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) \( r($x1) = $b - $m($x1)=$f1 \).
$PAR
(b) \( r($x1) = $f1 \) means water is entering the reservoir at $f1 gallons
per second at time \(t = $x1 \) seconds.
$PAR
(c) The vertical intercept first tells us that at time \(t = 0\) seconds,
the water is initially flowing in at the rate of $b gallons
per second.$BR
The horizontal intercept tells us that at \( $b/$m \approx $stop \) seconds,
the flow has stopped.$BR
The slope is \(-$m\).  This means that the rate  at which water enters the
reservoir decreases by $m gallons per second each second. The water is
flowing in at a decreasing rate.
$PAR
(d) The reservoir has more and more water when the rate, \( r(t) \), is
positive because water is being added. Water is being added until
\( t = $b/$m \) seconds later when it starts flowing out. This means at
\( t = $b/$m \), the most water is in the reservoir.
$PAR
(e) The reservoir has water draining out between \( t= $b/$m \) and
\( t= $t_max \), but this amount is not as much as the water that entered
between \( t=0 \) and \( t=$b/$m \). Thus, the reservoir had the least
amount of water at the beginning when \( t=0 \). Remember the function
\( r(t) \) gives the rate of flow, not the amount of water in the reservoir.
$PAR
(f) If the domain is specified as \( 0 \leq t \leq $t_max \) , then  the
rate varies from $b gallons per second  at \( t=0 \) to $f_min gallons per
second at \( t=$t_max \), so the range is \( $f_min \leq r(t) \leq $b \).
In interval notation we express the range as \( \lbrack $f_min, $b \rbrack \) .
