If the graph of the line \(y = mx + b\) is reflected over the
\($axis[$i]\)-axis, what will be the slope and intercepts of
the new graph?  (Your answers will depend on the parameters \(b\)
and \(m\).
$PAR
(a) The slope will be \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
(b) The \(y\)-intercept will be \( y = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
(c) The \(x\)-intercept will be \(x = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}

"If the line \( y = mx+b \) is reflected about the \(x\)-axis, its equation is \( y = - (mx+b) = -mx -b \).

(a) Its slope is \( -m \), the negative of the original slope.
$PAR
(b) Its \(y\)-intercept is \( y = -b \), the negative of the original \(y\)-intercept.
$PAR
(c) Its \(x\)-intercept is the value of \(x\) when \(y=0\).  Thus solving \( 0 = -m x - b \) we have an \(x\)-intercept at \( x = -b/m \).  It is the same as the original \(x\)-intercept.",
