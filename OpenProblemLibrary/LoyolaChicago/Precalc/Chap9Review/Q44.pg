solution. $EITALIC

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) \( \displaystyle f(x) =\frac{\mbox{Amount of Alcohol}}{\mbox{Amount of Liquid}} = \frac{x}{x+$a} \)
$PAR
(b) \( f($x0) = \frac{$x0}{$x0+$a} = \frac{$x0}{$bot} \approx $per \)${PERCENT}.  \( f($x0) \) is the concentration of alcohol in a solution consisting of $a gallons of water and $x0 gallons of alcohol.
$PAR
(c) \( f(x)=0 \) implies that \( \frac{x}{x+5} =0 \) and so \( x=0 \).    The
concentration of alcohol is 0$PERCENT when there is no alcohol in the
solution, that is, when \( x=0 \).
$PAR
(d) The horizontal asymptote is given by the ratio of the highest-power terms  of the numerator and denominator: \( y=\frac{x}{x} = 1=100\)${PERCENT}.  This means that as the amount of alcohol added, \( x \), grows large, the
concentration of alcohol in the solution approaches 100${PERCENT}.
$PAR
(e) See explanations above.
