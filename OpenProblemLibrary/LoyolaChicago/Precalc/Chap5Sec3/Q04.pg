$PAR
We can ignore graphs A and B since they are defined when
\( x \leq 0 \).  Recall the domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) is
\( x \ge 0 \).  Since the functions \( 4f(x) \),
\( -\frac{1}{2} f(x) \), and \( -5 f(x) \) are vertical
transformations of \( f(x) \), the transformations only affect the
\(y\)-coordinates.  The domain is the same for all of the functions,
\( x \ge 0 \).
$PAR
On the four remaining graphs, the graphs labeled C and D are above
the \(x\)-axis, so these two graphs are matched with \( f(x) \) and
\( 4f(x) \) (not necessarily in that order) since these two functions
are always positive.  Graph C must be the graph of \( 4 f(x) \) since
it is a vertical stretch of \( f(x) \), meaning for each \(x\) value,
the \(y\) value on the graph of \( 4 f(x) \) is four times as greater
than the \(y\) value on the graph of \( f(x) \).  This leaves graph D
to be paired with \( f(x) \) .
$PAR
The remaining two graphs E and F below the \(x\)-axis are paired with
the functions \( -1/2 f(x) \) and \( -5f(x) \) since these two functions
are reflections of \( f(x) \) over the \(x\)-axis.  Graph E must be
paired with \( -1/2 f(x) \) since it has been compressed closer the
\(x\)-axis, and graph F is therefore matched with \( -5 f(x) \) since
it has been stretched away from the \(x\)-axis.
