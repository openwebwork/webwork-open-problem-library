A ball is thrown into the air. Its height (in feet) \( t \) seconds later
is given by
$PAR
$funct
$BR
Based on the two equivalent forms of the function \(h(t) = $b t - 16 t^2 = t \cdot ($b - 16 t) \), answer the following questions:
$PAR
a) What is the height of the ball 1 second after it has been thrown?
\{ ans_rule(10) \}
(include \{ AnswerFormatHelp("units") \} in your answer)
$PAR
b) After how many seconds does the ball hit the ground? \{ ans_rule(10) \} (include \{  AnswerFormatHelp("units") \} in your answer)
$PAR
c) At what time(s) is the ball $h_ran feet above the ground?  If there is more than one answer, give your answer as a comma separated list of values.  Note that you do not have to include units in this answer.
$BR
After \{ ans_rule(30) \} seconds

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
a) After 1 second, \(t = 1\), and we wish to find the corresponding value of \( h(1) = $b(1) - 16(1)^2 = $h[1] \ \mbox{ft} \).
$PAR
b) When the ball hits the ground, its height is \(h(t) =0\).  We solve for \(t\):
\[\begin{aligned}
h(t) &= 0 = $b t - 16 t^2 \\
 0 &= 16 t ( $ground - t )
\end{aligned}\]
$PAR
Therefore the ball is on the ground when \(t = 0\) and \(t = $ground\).  When \(t  = 0\) it is at its starting position, and when \( t = $ground\) is how long it takes for it to hit the ground again.  The ball hits the ground after $ground s.
$PAR
c) When the ball is $h_ran feet high, its height is \(h(t) = $h_ran\).  We solve for \(t \)
\[
h(t) = $h_ran = $b t - 16 t^2 
\]
\[
-16 t^2 + $b t - $h_ran = 0
\]
$PAR
We can use the quadratic formula to solve this equation for \(t\) with \( a = -16 \), \( b = $b \), and \( c = -$h_ran \):
\[ t = \frac{ -($b) \pm \sqrt{$b^2 - 4(-16)(-$h_ran)}}{2(-16)} \approx $disp[0] \ , \ $disp[1] \]
$BR
There are two solutions since it is $h_ran feet high once at \(t \approx $disp[1]\) seconds (on its way up), and once again at \( t \approx $disp[0]\) (on its way back down).
