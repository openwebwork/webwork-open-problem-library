BEGIN_TEXT
\( P=f(t) \) gives the size of a population that begins with $a_th,000 members and grows at a continuous annual rate of $r${PERCENT}.

$BR
Find a formula for the population, $BR
\( \ \ \ \ P=f(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \} (do not include any commas in your formula)

$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
We have \( P = f(t)=ae^{kt} \) where the starting value is $BITALIC a $EITALIC = $a, and the continuous growth rate is $BITALIC k $EITALIC = $k, giving $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ P = f(t)=$a e^{$k t} \).
