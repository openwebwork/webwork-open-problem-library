SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR 
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) The population has increased by \($p2_th,000 - $p1_th,000 = $dy_th,000 \) people in that time period, so its total percent increase is $BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{$dy_th,000}{$p1_th,000} \approx $dec_total \) $BR
Thus the population has increased by about $ans1${PERCENT}.
$BR $SPACE
b) If $BITALIC b $EITALIC represents the annual growth factor, then in five years the population will have grown by a factor of \( b^5 \).  We learned in
part (a) that the population has increased by approximately $ans1${PERCENT} in that time, so it is $more${PERCENT} of what it had been five years earlier.  Thus $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ b^5 = $more_dec \) $BR 
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ b = ($more_dec)^{1/5} \approx $dec_b \) .
$BR
If, at the end of each year, the population is $per_annual$PERCENT of what it
had been at the beginning of the year, then the rate of growth is
about $ans2$PERCENT per year.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) The continuous annual growth rate is represented by $BITALIC k $EITALIC in the formula \( \ P(t)=P_0e^{kt} \ \) .  Since we know that the initial population is $p1_th,000 and the growth factor is $dec_b (from (b)), we can say
that \( \ P(t)= $p1_th,000 ($dec_b)^t \ \) defines this function.  To find $BITALIC k${EITALIC}, we can equate the two formulas: $BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ $p1_th,000($dec_b)^t = P_0e^{kt}= $p1_th,000e^{kt} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ ($dec_b)^t = e^{kt} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ $dec_b = e^k \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ln{($dec_b)} = \ln{(e^k)} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ k = \ln{($dec_b)} \approx $dec_k \) $BR
Thus, while the population is growing at $ans2$PERCENT per year, it is
growing at a rate of $ans3$PERCENT at any given instant.
