$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) If \( Q(t)=Q_0b^t \) describes the number of gallons left in the tank
after \( t \) hours, then \( Q_0 \), the amount we started with, is $a, and
\($b\), the percent left in the tank after 1 hour, is $remain${PERCENT}.
After two hours, \( ($b)($b) = $b^2 \approx $b_sq \) or
$b_sq_rt${PERCENT} remains.  After $t hours,
\( $b^{$t} \approx $dec1 \) or $almost1${PERCENT} remains.  Thus after
$t hours, $ans1${PERCENT} of the original amount has leaked from the tank.
$PAR
(b) Since \( Q_0= $a \), \( Q(t)= $a e^{kt} \).  But we can also define
\( Q(t)=$a ($b)^t \), so
\[\begin{aligned}
$a e^{kt} &= $a ($b)^t \\
e^{kt} &= $b^t \\
e^k 7= $b \\
\ln{(e^k)} &= \ln{($b)} \\
k \, \ln{(e)} &= \ln {($b)}\\
k &= \ln{($b)} \approx $k_rd
\end{aligned}\]
$PAR
(c)  Since \(k\) is negative, we know that the value of \(Q(t)\)
is decreasing by $k_rate${PERCENT} per hour.  Therefore, \(k\)
is the continuous hourly decay rate.
