BEGIN_TEXT
Practice:
$BR $SPACE $BR
Whenever you are asked to provide an EXACT solution to an exponential equation, you should not approximate any expressions which contain log's or ln's.  For example if the question is:
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
Find the solution to \( 2^x = 11 \) \( \ \ \ \ x = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
$SPACE
$BR
Using log's or ln's you can determine the EXACT solution is \( \frac{ \log{(11)} }{\log{(2)} } \) which is also equal to \( \frac{ \ln{(11)} }{\ln{(2)} } \ \).  In the blank you need to enter an expression EXACTLY equivalent to the numerical expressions $BBOLD ( log(11) )/( log(2) ) $EBOLD or $BBOLD ( ln(11) )/( ln(2) ) $EBOLD as they are typed in bold.  Entering an approximation such as 3.45943 will be marked as incorrect since this is not an exact answer.
$BR $HR
$BITALIC Note: Whenever you use functions such as log or ln you need to always follow the function with a left parenthesis, then type the expression which is being plugged into the log or ln, and finally close the function by typing a right parenthesis.  So if you wish to enter \( \log{(2x-8)} \) and you type $BBOLD log2x-8 $EBOLD or $BBOLD log 2x-8 $EBOLD or any other expression without parentheses you have not correctly entered expression, and your answer will be marked incorrect. $EITALIC
