In July 2005, the internet was linked by a global network of about $later million host computers.  The number of host computers has been growing approximately exponentially and was about $a million in July 1998.

(a) Find a formula for the number, ${BITALIC}N,${EITALIC} of internet host computers (in millions of computers) as an exponential function of ${BITALIC}t,${EITALIC} the number of years since July 1998, using exponential function of the form \( N(t) = ae^{kt} \).  What are the values of ${BITALIC}a${EITALIC} and ${BITALIC}k${EITALIC} in your model? 
$BR
\( a = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
\{ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") \} 
$BR
\( k = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \} (Either enter the answer in exact form, or a numerical approximation accurate to four decimal places.) 
$BR
$BR
(b) Based on your equation above, what is the annual percentage growth rate of ${BITALIC}N${EITALIC}?  (Enter your answer in exact form, or a numerical approximation that is accurate to 0.01 ${PERCENT}. Do not use approximations before the final answer.) 
$BR
By \{ ans_rule(30) \} $PERCENT

(c)  What is the doubling time of ${BITALIC}N${EITALIC}?  
\{ ans_rule(20) \} years (round your answer to the nearest 0.001 years)

$BR 
a) Since $BITALIC N $EITALIC = $a when $BITALIC t $EITALIC = 0, we have \( N = $a e^{kt} \).  We use the fact that $BITALIC N $EITALIC = $later when $BITALIC t $EITALIC = 7 to find $BITALIC k${EITALIC}: $BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ N = $a e^{kt}  \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ $later = $a e^{k \cdot 7} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \frac{$later}{$a} = e^{7k} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ln{($later/$a)} = 7k \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ k = \frac{\ln{($later/$a)}}{7} \approx $k \)
$BR
An exponential formula for the number of internet host computers as a function of years since July 1998 is \( N = $a e^{$k t} \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) Since \( r = (e^{$k}-1)\), the annual percent increase is $r${PERCENT}.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) We find $BITALIC t $EITALIC when $BITALIC N $EITALIC = 2($a) = $dbl_a :
$BR $SPACE $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ $dbl_a = $a e^{$k t} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ 2 = e^{$k t} \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ln{2} = $k t \) $BR
\( \ \ \ \ \ \ t = \frac{\ln{2}}{$k} \approx $d \).
$BR
The number of internet host computers is doubling every $d years.
