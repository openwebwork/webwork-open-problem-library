$PAR
(a) Let \( P(t)=P_0\,b^t \) describe our population at the end of
\( t \) years.  Since \( P_0 \) is the initial population, and the
population doubles every $d years, we know that, at the end of $d
years, our population will be \( 2 P_0 \).  But at the end of $d
years, our population is \( P($d)= P_0 b^{$d} \).  Thus
$PAR
\[\begin{aligned}
 P_0\,b^{$d} &= 2 P_0 \\
 b^{$d} &=  2 \\
 b &= 2^{1/$d} \approx $b_yr
\end{aligned}\]
Since \(b\) is our growth factor, the population is, yearly,
\(2^{1/$d}\cdot100 \approx $pct_yr\)${PERCENT} of what it had
been the previous year.  Thus it is growing by
\(r = b - 1 = 2^{1/$d} - 1 = (2^{1/$d} - 1)\cdot 100\) percent, which is approximately \($r\) percent
per year.
$PAR
(b) Writing our formula as \( P(t)=P_0 e^{kt} \), we have
\( P($d)=P_0e^{$d k} \).  But we already know that \( P($d) = 2P_0\).
Therefore,
\[\begin{aligned}
P_0\,e^{$d k} = 2P_0 \\
e^{$d k} &= 2 \\
\ln{ \left( e^{$d k} \right)} &=  \ln{ 2} \\
($d k) \ln{e} &= \ln{2} \\
$d k &= \ln{2} \\
k &= \frac{\ln{2}}{$d} \approx $k_rd
\end{aligned}\]
$BR
This tells us that we have a continuous annual growth rate of about
$cont$PERCENT per year.
