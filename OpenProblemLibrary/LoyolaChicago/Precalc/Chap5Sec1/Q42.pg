At a jazz club, the cost of an evening is based on a cover charge
of ${DOLLAR}$cover plus a beverage charge of ${DOLLAR}$bev per drink.
$PAR
(a) Find a formula for \( t(x) \), the total cost for an evening in which
\( x \) drinks are consumed. $BR
\( t(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}

$PAR
(b) If the price of the cover charge is raised by ${DOLLAR}$b, express
the new total cost function,  \( n(x) \), as a transformation of
\( t(x) \). $BR
\( n(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}$BBOLD Note${EBOLD}:  Do not give an explicit formula.  Using function
notation, write an expression for \(n(x)\) by performing
the necessary transformations to \(t(x)\).  For example your answer
should be of the form, \(n(x) = t(x-100)+180\) and not of the form
\(n(x) = 80x + 9\).$EITALIC

$PAR
(c) The management increases the cover charge to ${DOLLAR}$new_cov,
leaves the price of a drink at ${DOLLAR}$bev, but includes the $free[$pick]
for free. For \( x \ge $h \),  express \( p(x) \), the new total cost,
as a transformation of \( t(x) \). 
$BR
\( p(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
(see note in (b) above for the correct way to express your answer)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$PAR
(a) If each drink costs ${DOLLAR}$bev then \(x\) drinks cost
\( $bev x \).  Adding this to the ${DOLLAR}$cover cover charge, $BR
\[ t(x) = $cover + $bev x \quad\mbox{for}\quad x \ge 0. \]
$PAR
(b) If the cover charge is raised by ${DOLLAR}$b, then for any number
of drinks the new cost, \( n(x) \), is ${DOLLAR}$b more than the
old cost, \( t(x) \).  So
\[ n(x) = t(x) + $b. \]
Thus \( n(x) \)  is the vertical shift of \( t(x) \)  up $b units.
$PAR
(c) Since $h  $plural free, a customer who orders \( x \) drinks pays
for only \( x-$h \)  drinks at ${DOLLAR}$bev per drink if \( x \ge $h \).
So without accounting for the increased cover charge, at this point the
relation to the original cost is \( p(x) = t(x-$h) \).
$PAR
Since the cover charge has increased by ${DOLLAR}$diff from
${DOLLAR}$cover to ${DOLLAR}$new_cov, we need to do a vertical shift up
$diff units.  Thus altogether we have
\[ p(x) = t(x-$h) + $diff \quad\mbox{for}\quad \ x \ge $h.\]
