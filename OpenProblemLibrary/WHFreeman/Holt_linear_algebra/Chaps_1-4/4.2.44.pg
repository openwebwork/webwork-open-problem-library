SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR$PAR{BBOLD}SOLUTION:${EBOLD} $PAR
FALSE. For example, suppose  
\(U =\) span\(\left$LBRACE \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right] \right$RBRACE \) , then 
$PAR
\(U\) is linearly independent and is already a basis for \(S = R^2\), so adding more  vectors will not yield a basis.
