$PAR
SOLUTION
$PAR
A linear equation has a solution when the row reduced form of the augmented solution does not have a leading 1 in the extra column that corresponds to constants.  Since the columns of the matrix are linearly independent the number or columns is no more than the number of rows.  If there are fewer columns than rows we can produce a \({\bf b}\) for which there is no solution.

$PAR
The equation \(A{\bf x} = {\bf b}\) has a solution for all \({\bf b}\) precisely when it is a square matrix.
