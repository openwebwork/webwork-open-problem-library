SOLUTION
$PAR
If all 4 vectors are the zero vector, the first 3 of them still form a linearly dependent set.  If the first three vectors are linearly independent and the fourth vector is there sum, then the set of 4 vectors is linearly dependent while any subset of three will be linearly independent.
