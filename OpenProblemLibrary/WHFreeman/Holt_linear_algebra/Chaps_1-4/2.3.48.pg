SOLUTION
$PAR
If all 4 vectors are the zero vector, the first 3 of them still form a linearly dependent set.  If the first three vectors are linearly independent and the fourth vector is there sum, then the set of 4 vectors is linearly dependent while any subset of three will be linearly independent.

\(\lbrace{{\bf u}_1, {\bf u}_2, {\bf u}_3}\rbrace\) could be a linearly dependent or linearly dependent set of vectors depending on the vectors chosen.
