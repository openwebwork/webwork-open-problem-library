Consumers in Shelbyville have a choice of one of two
fast food restaurants, Krusty’s and McDonald’s. Both have trouble
keeping customers. Of those who last went to Krusty’s, $KrustythenMcD%
will go to McDonald’s next time, and of those who last went to
McDonald’s, $McDthenKrusty% will go to Krusty’s next time.
$BR
($BBOLD a$EBOLD) Find the transition matrix describing this situation.
\{$transition->ans_array\}
$BR
($BBOLD b$EBOLD) A customer goes out for fast food every Sunday, and just went
to Krusty’s.
$BR
i. What is the probability that two Sundays from now she will
go to McDonald’s? \{$sun2McD->ans_rule\}
$BR
ii. What is the probability that three Sundays from now she will
go to McDonald’s?\{$sun3McD->ans_rule\}
$BR
($BBOLD c$EBOLD) Suppose a consumer has just moved to Shelbyville, and there
is a $newKrusty% chance that he will go to Krusty’s for his first fast food
outing.What is the probability that his third fast food experience
will be at Krusty’s?\{$newsun2Krusty->ans_rule\}
$BR
($BBOLD d$EBOLD) Find the steady-state vector. \{$steadystate->ans_array\}

(a) \(A = $transition\) $PAR
(b) (i) \(A^2 $state = $transition^2 $state = $sun2\), so the probability that she will go to McDonald's two Sundays from now is \($sun2McD\). $PAR
(ii) \(A^2 $state = $transition^3 $state = $sun3\), so the probability that she will go to McDonald's three Sundays from now is \($sun3McD\). $PAR
(c) \(A^2 $newstate = $transition^2 $newstate = $newsun2\), so the probability that his third fast food experience will be at Krusty's will be \($newsun2Krusty\). $PAR
