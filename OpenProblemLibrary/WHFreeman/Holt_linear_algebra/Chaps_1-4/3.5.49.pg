Consumers in Shelbyville have a choice of one of two
fast food restaurants, Krusty's and McDonald's. Both have trouble
keeping customers. Of those who last went to Krusty's, $KrustythenMcD$PERCENT
will go to McDonald's next time, and of those who last went to
McDonald's, $McDthenKrusty$PERCENT will go to Krusty's next time.
$PAR
($BBOLD a$EBOLD) Find the transition matrix describing this situation.  (Assume the components of the state vector are in this order [Krusty's customers, McDonald's customers]).$BR
\{$transition->ans_array\}
$PAR
($BBOLD b$EBOLD) A customer goes out for fast food every Sunday, and just went
to Krusty's.
$PAR
i. What is the probability that two Sundays from now she will
go to McDonald's? $BR

ii. What is the probability that three Sundays from now she will
go to McDonald's?$BR
\{$sun3McD->ans_rule\}
$PAR
($BBOLD c$EBOLD) Suppose a consumer has just moved to Shelbyville, and there
is a $newKrusty$PERCENT chance that he will go to Krusty's for his first fast food
outing.  What is the probability that his third fast food experience
will be at Krusty's?\{$newsun2Krusty->ans_rule\}
$PAR
($BBOLD d$EBOLD) Find the steady-state vector.

(a) \(A = $transition\) $PAR
(b) (i) \(A^2 $state = $transition^2 $state = $sun2\), so the probability that she will go to McDonald's two Sundays from now is \($sun2McD\). $PAR
