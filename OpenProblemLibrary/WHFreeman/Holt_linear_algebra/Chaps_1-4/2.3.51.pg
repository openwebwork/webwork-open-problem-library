$PAR
SOLUTION
$PAR
If \({\bf u}_i\) is the vector in \({\mathbb R}^4\) that has a \(1\) for the \(i\)th component and a zero for the other components, then 
\(\lbrace{{\bf u}_1, {\bf u}_2, {\bf u}_3, {\bf u}_4}\rbrace\) is linearly independent.
$BR
If we replace the first vector with the zero vector, the set \(\lbrace{{\bf u}_1, {\bf u}_2, {\bf u}_3, {\bf u}_4}\rbrace\) is linearly dependent.

$PAR
\(\lbrace{{\bf u}_1, {\bf u}_2, {\bf u}_3, {\bf u}_4}\rbrace\) could be a linearly independent or linearly dependent set of vectors depending on the vectors chosen.
