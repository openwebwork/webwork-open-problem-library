Suppose that \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are nonzero subspaces, with \(S_1\) contained inside \(S_2\), and suppose that \(dim(S_2) = 4\)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The dimension of \(S_1\) cannot exceed the dimension of \(S_2\), since \(S_1\) is contained in \(S_2\). \(S_1\) us non-zero, and thus the its dimension cannot be zero. Hence the possible dimensions of \(S_1\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
$BR$BR
b) If \(S_1 \ne S_2\), then \(S_1\) is properly contained in \(S_2\), and the dimension of \(S_1\) is strictly less than the dimension of \(S_2\). So the possible dimensions of \(S_1\) are 1, 2, and 3.
