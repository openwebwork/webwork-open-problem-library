SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
SOLUTION
$PAR
The linear independence of the columns does not change with row reduction.  Since the columns are linearly independent, after row reduction, each column contains a leading 1.  We get nontrivial solutions when we have columns without a leading 1 in the row reduced matrix.
$PAR
The equation \(A{\bf x} = {\bf 0}\) never has nontrivial solutions.
