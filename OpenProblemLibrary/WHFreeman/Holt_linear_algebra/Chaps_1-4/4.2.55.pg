Suppose that \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are nonzero subspaces, with \(S_1\) contained inside \(S_2\), and suppose that \(dim(S_2) = 3\)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
a) The dimension of \(S_1\) cannot exceed the dimension of \(S_2\)  since \(S_1\) is contained in \(S_2\). \(S_1\) is non-zero, and thus its dimension cannot be 0. Hence the possible dimensions of \(S_1\) are 1, 2, and 3.
$BR
b) If \( S_1 \ne S_2\), then \(S_1\) is properly contained in \(S_2\), and the dimension of \(S_1\) is strictly less than the dimension of \(S_2\). Thus the possible dimensions of \(S_1\) are 1 and 2.
