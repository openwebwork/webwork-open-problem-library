A rumor spreads through a school.  Let \(y(t)\) be the fraction of the population that has heard the rumor at time \(t\) and assume that the rate at which the rumor spreads is proportional to the product of the fraction \(y\) of the population that has heard the rumor and the fraction \(1-y\) that has not yet heard the rumor.

$PAR
The school has 1000 students in total.  At 8 a.m., $p0 students have heard the rumor, and by noon, half the school has heard it.  Using the logistic model explained above, determine how much time passes before 90% of the students will have heard the rumor.
$PAR
90% of the students have heard the rumor after about \{ans_rule()\} hours.

$PAR
$SOL
Let \(y(t)\) be the proportion of students that have heard the rumor at a time \(t\) hours after 8 a.m.  In the logistic model, we have a capacity of \(A = 1\) (100% of students) and an unknown growth factor of \(k\).  Hence,

\[ y(t) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{e^{-kt}}{C}}. \]

The initial condition \(y(0) = $p0div\) allows us to determine the value of \(C\):
$PAR
\( $p0div = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{C}} \); so \( C = $C \).  Thus,
$PAR
\[ y(t) = \frac{1}{1 + $neginvC e^{-kt}}. \]
$PAR
The condition \(y(4) = 0.5\) now allows us to determine the value of \(k\):
$PAR
\( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{1 + $neginvC e^{-4k}} \); so \( k \approx $k \, \text{hours}^{-1} \).
$PAR
90% of the students have heard the rumor when \(y(t) = 0.9\).  Thus
$PAR
\( \frac{9}{10} = \frac{1}{1 + $neginvC e^{-$k t}} \)
$PAR
\( t \approx $t \) hours.
$PAR
Thus, 90% of the students have heard the rumor after about \($t\) hours.
