SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$SOL
(a) Rate of Change of Loan = (Amount still owed)(Interest rate) - (Payback rate)
$PAR
\( = P(t) * r - N = r\left(P - \frac{N}{r} \right) \).
$PAR
Therefore, if \( y = P(t) \),
\( y' = r\left(y - \frac{N}{r}\right) = ry - N \)
$PAR
(b) From the differential equation derived in part (a), we know that \( P(t) = \frac{N}{r} + Ce^{rt} = $ndivr1 + Ce^{{$r}t} \).  Since \($p0_curr\) was initially borrowed, \( P(0) = $ndivr1 + C \), and \( C = $C1 \).  The loan is paid off when \( P(t) = $ndivr1 - {$negC1}e^{{$r}t} = 0 \).  This yields
$PAR
\( t = \frac{1}{$r}\ln\left(\frac{$ndivr1}{$negC1}\right) = $time \approx $years \) years.
$PAR
(c) If the annual rate of payment is \($N2_curr\), then \( P(t) = \frac{$N2}{$r} + Ce^{{$r}t} = $ndivr2 + Ce^{{$r}t} \).  With \( P(0) = $ndivr2 + C = $p0 \), it follows that \( C = $C2 \).  Since \( C > 0 \) and \( e^{{$r}t} \to \infty \) as \( t \to \infty \), \( P(t) \to \infty \), and the loan will never be paid back.
