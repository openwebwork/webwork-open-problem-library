$PAR
Calculate the force (in Newtons) required to push a ${mass}kg wagon up a $rad radian inclined plane.  One Newton (N) is equal to 1\(\frac{kg \cdotp m}{s^2}\), and the force due to gravity on the wagon is \( F = m * g \), where \( m \) is the mass of the wagon, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8\(\frac{m}{s^2}\)).  Please ignore friction in this problem.
$PAR
Hint: draw a picture, and express the forces on the wagon as vectors.
$PAR
Force = \{ans_rule()\} \( N \)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$SOL
The coordinate system used in this solution is an xy-plane with positive x in the direction going "up" the slope (but parallel to the flat ground), and positive y straight up to the sky (normal to the flat ground).
$PAR
$PAR
To solve this problem, we must express it in terms of vectors.  Gravity is represented by a downward force vector of magnitude \( ${mass}kg * ${g}\frac{m}{s^2} = $mg N \).  The direction is downward, so this vector is \( F_g = \left< 0, -$mg N \right> \).
$PAR
Now, the other forces acting on the wagon are:
$PAR
(a) A "normal force", \(F_n\) perpendicular to the inclined plane.
$PAR
(b) A "rolling force" \(F_r\) parallel to the inclined plane.
$PAR
The force that we need to overcome to push the wagon up the inclined plane is the rolling force.  To find this, we first need a vector in the direction of the inclined plane.  Since we know the angle of incline, we can use the unit vector \( \left< \cos{(\theta)}, \sin{(\theta)} \right> \).
$PAR
Now that we have a vector representing the force of gravity and a vector representing the angle of the inclined plane, we need to solve for the rolling force.  This is simply the projection of \( F_g \) onto our slope \( \left< \cos{(\theta)}, \sin{(\theta)} \right> \), so
$PAR
\( F_r = proj_{\left< \cos{(\theta)}, \sin{(\theta)} \right>}\left( \left< 0, -$mg N \right>\right) = \left< \{$proja[0]\} N, \{$proja[1]\} N \right> \).
$PAR
Our answer is the magnitude of this vector, or $ans Newtons.
