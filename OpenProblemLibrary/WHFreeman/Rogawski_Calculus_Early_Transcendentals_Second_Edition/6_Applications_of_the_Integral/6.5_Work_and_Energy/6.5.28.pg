How much work is done lifting a $l-m chain over the side of a building if the chain
has mass density $d kg/m? Assume \(g = 9.8 \text {m/s}^2\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$SOL
Consider a segment of the chain of length \(\Delta y\) located a distance \(y_j\) meters from the top
of the building. The work needed to lift this segment of the chain to the top of the
building is approximately
\[W_j\approx($d\Delta y)(9.8)y_j\text{ J}\]
Summing over all segments of the chain and passing to the limit as \(\Delta y\to0\), it follows that the total work is
\[\int_0^{$l}$d\cdot9.8ydy=\{$d*4.9\}y^2|_0^{$l}=$w\text{ J}\]
