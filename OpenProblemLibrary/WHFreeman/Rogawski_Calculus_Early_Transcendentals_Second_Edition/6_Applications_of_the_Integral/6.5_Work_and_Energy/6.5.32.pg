A $m-lb wrecking ball hangs from a $l-ft cable of density $d lb/ft attached to a
crane. Calculate the work done if the crane lifts the ball from ground level to $l ft in the
air by drawing in the cable.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
We will treat the cable and the wrecking ball separately. Consider a segment of the cable of length \(\Delta y\) that must be lifted \(y_j\) feet. The work needed to lift the cable segment is approximately
\[W_j\approx($d\Delta y)y_j\text{ ft-lbs}\]
Summing over all of the segments of the cable and passing to the limit as \(\Delta y\to0\), it follows that lifting the cable requires
\[\int_0^{$l}$d ydy=
\{($d%2==0)?($d/2):"\frac{$d}{2}"\}
y^2|_0^{$l}=\{$d*$l**2/2\}\text{ ft-lbs.}\]
Lifting the $m lb wrecking ball $l feet requires additional \{$m*$l\} ft-lbs. Thus, the total work is $w ft-lbs.
