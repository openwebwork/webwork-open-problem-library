A $l-ft chain with mass density $d lb/ft is initially coiled on the ground. How much
work is performed in lifting the chain so that it is fully extended (and one end touches the
ground)?

$PAR
$SOL
Consider a segment of the chain of length \(\Delta y\) that must be lifted \(y_j\) feet off the ground. The work needed to lift this segment of the chain is approximately
\[W_j\approx($d\Delta y)y_j\text{ ft-lbs.}\]
Summing over all segments of the chain and passing to the limit as \(\Delta y\to 0\), it follows that the total work is
\[\int_0^{$l}$d ydy=
\{($d%2==0)?(($d==2)?'':($d/2)):"\frac{$d}2"\} y^2|_0^{$l}=$w\text{ ft-lbs.}\]
