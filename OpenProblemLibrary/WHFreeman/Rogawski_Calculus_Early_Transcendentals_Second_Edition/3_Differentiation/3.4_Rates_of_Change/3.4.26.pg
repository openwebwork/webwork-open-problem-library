$SOL
We employ Galileo's formula,
\[ s(t) = s_0 - 1/2 g t^2 = $h - 4.9 t^2 \]
where the time, \(t\), is in seconds (s) and the height, \(s\), is in meters (m).  When the ball hits the ground its height is 0.  Solve \( s(t) = $h - 4.9 t^2 = 0 \) to obtain \(t = $timehit\) s.  (We discard the negative time, which took place before the ball was dropped.)  The velocity at time \(t\) is given by \( s'(t)=-2\cdot4.9\cdot t \), and so the velocity at impact is 
\[ v($timehit) = -9.8 ($timehit) = $ans m/s \]
This signifies that the ball is falling at $posans m/s.
