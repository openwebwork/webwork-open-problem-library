A man on the $fl\(\)th floor of a building sees a bucket (dropped by a window washer) pass his window 
and notes that it hits the ground $t s later.  Assuming a floor is $ht ft high 
(and neglecting air friction), from which floor was the bucket dropped? (Note: your answer should be
an integer)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR
$SOL
A falling object moves \( 16 t^2 \) feet in t seconds.  Suppose H is the unknown height from which the bucket fell starting at time zero.  The man saw it at some time t (also unknown to us) and it hit the ground, $howfar feet down at time t + $t.  Thus
\[ (H - 16 t^2) - (H - 16(t+$t)^2) = $howfar \]
The H's cancel as do the \( t^2 \) terms and solving for t gives t = $showtime s.  Thus the bucket fell \( 16\cdot($showtime)^2=$showdist \) feet before the man saw it.  Since there are $ht feet in a floor the bucket was dropped from $exactextrafloors floors above the $fl\(\)th.
