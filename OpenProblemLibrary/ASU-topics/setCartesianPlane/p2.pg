BEGIN_TEXT
A convertible and a minivan leave a highway junction at the same time.
The convertible travels west at $west miles per hour and the minivan travels 
north at $north miles per hour. Assuming the two vehicles do not deviate off course, 
how far apart are they after $farapart $hour?  
	$PAR
	Distance Apart = \{ans_rule(40)\}
