Suppose that for a company manufacturing calculators, the cost,
and revenue equations are given by
\[
    C=$a + $b x, \qquad R=$c - \frac{x^2}{$d},
\]
where the production output in one week is \(x\) calculators.  If
the production rate is increasing at a rate of 500 calculators
when the production output is 6000 calculators, find each of the
following:
$BR
$BR
Rate of change in cost = \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$BR
Rate of change in revenue = \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$BR
Rate of change in profit = \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR

@ans = (num_cmp(500*$b), num_cmp(-2*6000*500/$d), num_cmp(-2*6000*500/$d - 500*$b));
ANS(@ans);
