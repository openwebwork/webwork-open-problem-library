If the graph represents \(y\) as a function of \(x\), state the domain and range of the function.  If the graph does not represent \(y\) as a function of \(x\), leave the answer blanks for \(x\) and \(y\) empty.
$BR$BR
The domain is:\{ans_rule(40) \}

The range is:\{ans_rule(40) \}$PAR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
Write your answer in interval notation. If the answer includes more
than one interval write the intervals separated by the union symbol, U.
