BEGIN_TEXT
The marketing department of a company estimates that the demand for a product
is given by \(p=$a - $bstr x\) dollars, where \(p\) is the price per unit and \(x\)
is the number of units.
$PAR
The cost of producing \(x\) units is given by \(C = $c + $d x\) dollars, 
and the profit
for producing \(x\) units is given by
\[ P = R-C = x p - C .\]
Skech the graph of the profit function and estimate the number
of units that would produce a maximum profit.
	$PAR
	\(x\) for maximum: \{ans_rule(60)\}
