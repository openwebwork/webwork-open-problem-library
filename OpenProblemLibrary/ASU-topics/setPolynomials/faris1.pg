BEGIN_TEXT

The demand equation for a certain product is given by \(p = $b - $a x \) , where
\(p\) is the unit price (in dollars) of the product and \(x\) is the number of units
produced. 
The total revenue obtained by producing and selling \(x\) units is given by 
\(R = x p\).
$PAR
Determine prices \(p\) that would yield a revenue of  $revenue_in_dollars dollars.

	$PAR
	Lowest such price  = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
	Highest such price = \{ans_rule(20)\}
