BEGIN_TEXT
The half-life of strontium-90 is 28 years. Suppose we have a $a mg sample.
$PAR
(a) Find a function that models the mass \(m(t)\) remaining after \(t\) years.
$BR
\( m(t) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
(b) How much of the sample will remain after $t years?
$BR
\( m($t) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\} mg.
$PAR
(c) How long will it take the sample to decay to a mass of $b mg?
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(20) \} years.

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD if you round off values in earlier parts of this
problem, the answers might be marked as correct.  But, the error from
rounding off can be magnified in later parts of the problem and lead to
answers which are not close enough to being marked correct.  It is a
good idea to ${BITALIC}not$EITALIC use rounded values when computing later
parts of a problem.
