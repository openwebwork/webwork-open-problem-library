BEGIN_TEXT
A $food is served at a dinner party. 
It starts to cool according
to Newton's Law of Cooling.  Its temperature \(T\) (measured in degrees Fahrenheit) after \(t\) minutes is given by 
\[ T(t) = $room + $a e^{-$r t} \]
$BR$BR
What is the initial temperature of the food?
$BR$BR
\{ans_rule(25) \} degrees Fahrenheit.

$BR$HR$BR
What is the temperature after $b minutes?
$BR$BR
\{ans_rule(25) \} degrees Fahrenheit.

$BR$HR$BR
How long will it take from the time the food is served until the
temperature is $targ degrees Fahrenheit?
$BR$BR

\{ans_rule(25) \} minutes.
