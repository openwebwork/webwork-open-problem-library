Solve the system using the substitution or elimination method
\[ \left\{ "\{"; \}
\begin{array}{l}
        5x+2y = $b1, \\
        7x+3y = $b2. 
\end{array}\right.

$BR
Your answer is: \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
If there is more than one point, type the points separated by a comma, i.e.: (1,2),(3,4)).
$BR
If the system has no solution type $BITALIC none $EITALIC in the answer blank.
