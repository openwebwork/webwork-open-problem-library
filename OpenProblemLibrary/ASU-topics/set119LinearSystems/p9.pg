A woman has $ttl coins in her pocket, all of which are dimes and quarters.
If the total value of the coins is $DOLLAR \{ sprintf("%.2f",$value) \}, how many dimes and how
many quarters does she have?

Your answer is:
$BR
Number of dimes equals \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
Number of quarters equals \{ans_rule(25) \}
