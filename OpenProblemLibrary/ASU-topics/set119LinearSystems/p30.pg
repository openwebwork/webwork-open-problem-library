BEGIN_TEXT
Susan places  $DOLLAR$sum in three investments at rates of 
$c1$PERCENT, $c2$PERCENT and $c3$PERCENT per annum, respectively.
The total income after one year is $DOLLAR \{ sprintf("%.2f",$inc)\} . If the amount placed in the third
investment is $DOLLAR$b more than the amount placed in the second, find
the amount of each investment. 
$BR
Your answer is:
$BR
Amount at $c1$PERCENT equals: $DOLLAR  \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
Amount at $c2$PERCENT equals: $DOLLAR  \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
Amount at $c3$PERCENT equals: $DOLLAR  \{ans_rule(25) \}
