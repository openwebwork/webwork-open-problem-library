BEGIN_TEXT
A man invests his savings in two accounts, one paying 6$PERCENT  and the other
paying 10$PERCENT simple interest per year. He puts twice as much in the 
lower-yielding account because it is less risky. His annual interest is $DOLLAR$sum
dollars. 
How much did he invest at each rate?
$BR
Your answer is:
$BR
Amount invested at 6$PERCENT  equals $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
Amount invested at 10$PERCENT equals $DOLLAR  \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
