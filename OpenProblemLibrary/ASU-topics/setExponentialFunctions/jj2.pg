An amount of ${DOLLAR}$a is invested at an interest rate of $rt$PERCENT per
year, compounded $tword.

Find the value \(A(t)\) of the investment after \(t\) years.

Use $BITALIC your$EITALIC graph of \(A(t)\) to determine when this investment
will amount to ${DOLLAR}$targ,000.  Give your answer in years, correct to the nearest
hundredth.  You will have to zoom on your graph to determine the answer.
