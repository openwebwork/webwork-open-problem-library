BEGIN_TEXT
Let \( f(x)=e^{-x}-$a \) and \( g(x)=e^x \).
Consider the following actions:
$BR
$BR
(a) reflecting the graph of \(g(x)\) in the \(x\)-axis;
$BR
(b) reflecting the graph of \(g(x)\) in the \(y\)-axis;
$BR
(c) shifting the resulting graph to the right $a units;
$BR
(d) shifting the resulting graph to the left $a units;
$BR
(e) shifting the resulting graph upward $a units;
$BR
(f) shifting the resulting graph downward $a units;
$BR
The graph of \(f(x)\) can be obtained from the graph of \(g(x)\)
by first doing \{ pop_up_list('?'=>'?', 'a'=>'a', 'b'=>'b')\}
followed by \{ pop_up_list('?'=>'?', 'c'=>'c', 'd'=>'d', 'e'=>'e', 'f'=>'f')\}
$BR
$BR
What is 
What is the domain of the function \(f(x)\)? \{ ans_rule(30)\}
$BR
Give your answer in \{ helpLink("interval notation") \}.
$BR
$BR
What is the range  of the function \(f(x)\)?  \{ans_rule(30) \}
$BR
Give your answer in \{ helpLink("interval notation") \}.
