# Now we do the randomization of variables, and other computations
# as needed for this problem.  Sometimes we compute the answers here.

$a = random(0.01,0.05,0.01);
$b = random(24,30);

# The answer is the geometric sum of the above series.

BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you go to a company that pays $a for the first day, $c for the 
second day, $d for the third day and so on. 
If the daily wage keeps doubling, what will your total income be for 
working $b days?

	$BR$BR
	Total Income  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD your answer needs to be correct to the nearest penny
