Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation. 
\[ \frac{6}{x-1}-\frac{6}{x}\ge 1 \] 
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by
the "union" symbol, U. If needed enter \(\infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
