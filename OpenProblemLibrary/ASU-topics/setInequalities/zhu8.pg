Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation. 
\[ 1+\frac{2}{x+1}\le\frac{2}{x} \]

$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by
the "union" symbol, U. If needed enter \(\infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
