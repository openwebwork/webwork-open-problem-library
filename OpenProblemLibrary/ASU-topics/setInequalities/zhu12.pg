BEGIN_TEXT
A rectangular field with a perimeter of $perim feet must have an area of at
least $area square feet (or possibly more). 
What are the possible values for the length of one side so that both
conditions are met?
Express your answer in interval notation.

Answer: \{ans_rule(35) \}
$BR$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by
the "union" symbol, U. If needed enter \(\infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
