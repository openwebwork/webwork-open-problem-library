Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation. 
\[ x^4 > $pol \]

Answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}

$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by
the "union" symbol, U. If needed enter \(\infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
