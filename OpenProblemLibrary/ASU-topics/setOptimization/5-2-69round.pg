a new lipstick line.  The marketing research department has found
that the demand in a particular city is given approximately by

\[  p = \frac{$a}{e^x}, \quad  0 \leq x \leq 2, \]
where \(x\) thousand lipsticks were sold per week at a price of
\(p\) dollars each.  At what price will the weekly revenue be
