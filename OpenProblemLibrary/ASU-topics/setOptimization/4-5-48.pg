TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The owner of a $store store wants to construct a fence to enclose
a rectangular outdoor storage area adjacent to the store, using part of
the side of
the store (which is $a feet long) for part of one of the sides.
(See the figure below.)  There are $b feet of
fencing available to complete the job. Find the length
of the sides parallel to the store and perpendicular that will
maximize the total area of the outdoor enclosure.
