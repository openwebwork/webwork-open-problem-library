TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A company runs food service concessions for sporting events
throughout the country.  Their marketing research department chose
a particular football stadium to test market a new jumbo hot dog.
It was found that the demand for the new hot dog is given
approximately by
\[  p = $a - \ln(x), \quad 5 \leq x \leq 500, \]
where \(x\) is the number of hot dogs (in thousands) that can be
sold during one game at a price of \(p\) dollars.  If the company
pays 1 dollar for each hot dog, how should the hot dogs be priced
to maximize the profit per game?
