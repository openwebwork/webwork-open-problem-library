A small resort is situated on an island that lies exactly $a miles
from \(P\), the nearest point to the island along a perfectly
straight shoreline.  10
miles down the shoreline from \(P\) is the closest source of fresh
water.  If it costs $b times as much money to lay pipe in the
water as it does on land, how far down the shoreline from \(P\)
should the pipe from the island reach land in order to minimize
the total construction costs?
