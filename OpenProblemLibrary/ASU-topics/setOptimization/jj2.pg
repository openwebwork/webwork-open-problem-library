BEGIN_TEXT
A $what wants to estimate the maximum number of cars that can
safely travel on a particular road at a given speed.  $gen assumes that each
car is $len feet long, travels at speed \(s\), and follows the car in front of
it at a safe distance for that speed.  $gen finds that the number \(N\) of cars that
can pass a given spot per minute is modeled by the function

\[ N(s) = \frac{$num s}{$len + $len \left(\displaystyle\frac{s}{$den}\right)^2} \]

At what speed can the greatest number of cars travel safely on that road?
