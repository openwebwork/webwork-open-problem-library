BEGIN_TEXT
In a survey of $total people, the following data were obtained relating
gender to color-blindness:

\{begintable(4)\}
\{row(" ", "Color-Blind (C)", "Not Color - Blind \(\overline C \)","Total" )\}
\{row("Male (M)", "$a", "$b", "$Mtotal ") \}
\{row("Female (F)", "$c", "$d"," $Ftotal ") \}
\{row("Total", "$Ctotal", "$notCtotal","$total")\}
\{endtable()\}

$BR
A person is randomly selected. What is the probability that the person is:
$BR
a) Male?  \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
b) Male and Color-blind? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
c) Male given that the person is Color-blind? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
d) Color-blind given that the person is Male? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
e) Female given that the person is not Color-blind? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
f) Are the events Male and Color blind independent?
\{ ans_rule(10)\}  Enter ${BITALIC}yes$EITALIC or ${BITALIC}no$EITALIC.
