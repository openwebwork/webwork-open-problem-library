BEGIN_TEXT
A card is drawn from a regular deck of 52 cards and is then put back in the
deck. A second card is drawn. What is the probability that:
$PAR
(a) The first card is red.  $SPACE \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(b) The second card is hearts given that the first is red.$SPACE  \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(c) The first card is red and the second is hearts. $SPACE \{ ans_rule(20) \}
