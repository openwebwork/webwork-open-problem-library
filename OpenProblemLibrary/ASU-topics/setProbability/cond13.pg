BEGIN_TEXT
In a survey of $total people, the following data were obtained relating
gender to political orientation:

\{begintable(5)\}
\{row(" ", "Republican (R)", "Democrat (D)","Independent (I)", "Total" )\}
\{row("Male (M)", "$a", "$b", "$c","$Mtotal ") \}
\{row("Femal (F)", "$d", "$e",,"$f"," $Ftotal ") \}
\{row("Total", "$Rtotal", "$Dtotal","$Itotal","$total")\}
\{endtable()\}

$BR
A person is randomly selected. What is the probability that the person is:
$BR
a) Male?  \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
b) Male and a Democrat? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
c) Male given that the person is a Democrat? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
d) Republican given that the person is Male? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
e) Female given that the person is an Independent? \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
