BEGIN_TEXT
What is the probability that a $n-digit phone number contains at least one $b?
(Repetition of numbers and lead zero are allowed).

$BR
Answer: \{ $ans->ans_rule(10) \}

END_TEXT

ANS($ans->cmp() );

BEGIN_SOLUTION
It is easiest to think about the probability that the phone number contains
no ${b}s.  For each digit, there are 9 ways to not pick a $b; there are 10
ways in total.  Thus the total number of ways to avoid picking a $b in the
$n digit number is \(9^$n\), and the total number of ways to pick any phone
number is \(10^$n\).  The probability of having no ${b}s is therefore
\((\frac9{10})^$n\), and the probability of having at least one $b is
\(1 - (\frac9{10})^$n\).
