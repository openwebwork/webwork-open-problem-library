BEGIN_TEXT
The demand function for a certain children bicycle is given by  
\( x = 10 \sqrt{(50-p)/p} \)
$BR 
Where x is the quantity demanded per week and p (0<p<50)is the unit price in dollars.
$BR
(a) Evaluate the elasticity at 40.
\(E(10)=\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(b) Should the unit price be raised slightly from 40 in order to increase revenue?
 Enter 1 for $BITALIC Yes $EITALIC or 2 for $BITALIC No $EITALIC.
\(answer=\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(c) When is the demand unitary.
\(p=\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
$BR
(d) What is the maximum revenue?
\(Revenue =\) \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
