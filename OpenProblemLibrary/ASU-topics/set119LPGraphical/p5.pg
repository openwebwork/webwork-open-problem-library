BEGIN_TEXT

A diet is to contain at least $vit units of carbohydrates, 
$min units of proteins, and $cal calories.
Two foods are available: \(F_1 \) which costs
$DOLLAR $c1 per unit and \( F_2 \), which costs $DOLLAR $c2 per unit.
A unit of food \(F_1 \) contains  $vit1 units of carbohydrates,  $min1 units
of proteins and $cal1 calories. A unit of food \(F_2 \) contains
$vit2 units of carbohydrates, $min2 units of proteins and $cal2 calories.
$BR$BR
Find the minimum cost for a diet that consists of a mixture of these
two foods and also meets the minimal nutrition requirements.
$BR
$BR
Corner points of the feasible region: $SPACE \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
If there is more than one corner point, type the points separated by a comma
(i.e. (1,2),(3,4)).
$BR
$BR
Minimum cost is: $SPACE $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(15) \} 
$BR
when  \(F_1 = \) $SPACE \{ans_rule(15) \}  units 
$BR
 and  \(F_2 = \)$SPACE  \{ans_rule(15) \} units.
