BEGIN_TEXT

Graph the system of inequalities. Tell whether the system is bounded or
unbounded and list each corner point.
\[ \left\{"\{"\}
\begin{array}{r${NO_SPACE}r${NO_SPACE}r}

$BR
$BR
Region is: \{ans_rule(20) \}
Input $BITALIC bounded $EITALIC or $BITALIC unbounded $EITALIC.

Corner Points:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$BR
If there is more than one corner point, type the points separated by a comma
(i.e.: (1,2),(3,4)).
