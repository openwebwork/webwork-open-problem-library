BEGIN_TEXT

A manufacturer of downhill and cross-country skis reports that manufacturing
time is $man1 hours and $man2 hours, respectively, per ski and that finishing time is 
$fin1 hours for each downhill and $fin2 hours for each cross-crountry ski. There are 
only $man hours per week available for the manufacturing process and  $fin hours for the finishing process. 

The average profit is $DOLLAR$p1 for downhill ski and $DOLLAR$p2 for cross-country ski.
The manufacturer wants to know  how many of each type of ski should be made to
maximize the weekly profit.
$BR
$BR
Corner points of the feasible region: $SPACE \{ ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
If there is more than one corner point, type the points separated by a comma
(i.e. (1,2),(3,4)).
$BR
$BR
Maximum profit is: $SPACE  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
when $SPACE \{ans_rule(15) \}  downhill skis
$BR
 and $SPACE  \{ans_rule(15) \} cross country skis are produced.
