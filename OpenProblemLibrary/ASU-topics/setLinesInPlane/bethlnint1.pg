# choose values for the coordinates of the point and the slope
$x     = random(-10, 10);
$y     = random(-10, 10);
$slope = random(-10, 10);

$yint = Point(0, $y - $slope * $x);

BEGIN_PGML
A line through [`([$x], [$y])`] with a slope of [`[$slope]`] has a [`y`]-intercept of [_]{$yint}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Recall that the slope through two points [`P(x_1, y_1)`] and [`Q(x_2, y_2)`] is 
[``` m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} ```]
which can be written
[``` m(x_2-x_1) = y_2 -y_1 ```]
Let [`P`] be the point given and [`Q`] be the [`y`]-intercept with [`x_2=0`] and [`y_2`] being sought. Adding [`y_1`] to both sides of the equation is
[``` y_2 = y_1 + m(x_2-x_1) = [$y] + [$slope] (0-[$x]) = [@ $y-$slope*$x @] ```]

So the [`y`]-intercept is [`[$yint]`].
