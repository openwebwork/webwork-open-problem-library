Context('Fraction');

$a = random(2, 20);
$b = random(2, 20);
$m = Fraction(-$a, $b);

BEGIN_PGML
Find the slope and [`y`]-intercept of the line
[` [$a] x+[$b] y=0 `].

a) The slope of the line is: [_]{$m}

b) The [`y`]-intercept of the line is: [_]{Real(0)}{15}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We solve the equation [`[$a]x + [$b] y = 0`] for [`y`].  First substract [`[$a]x`] from both sides:
[``` 
\begin{aligned}
[$b]y & = -[$a]x \\
& \qquad \text{divide through by [$b]} \\
y & = [$m] x
\end{aligned}
```]
and then identify that the coefficient of the [`x`] term is the slope and since there isn't a constant term, the [`y`]-intercept is 0.
