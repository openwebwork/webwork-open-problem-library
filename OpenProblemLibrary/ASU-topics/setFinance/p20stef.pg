Ruben invested $DOLLAR$P per year in an IRA each year for $b1 years earning
$c$PERCENT compounded annually.
$BR
At the end of $b1 years he ceased the IRA payments, but continued to invest
his accumulated amount at $c$PERCENT compounded annually for the next $b2 years.

b) What was the value of the investment at the end of the next $b2 years?
