Find the effective rate of interest for 
$BR
a) $c1$PERCENT compounded monthly
$BR
Answer = $SPACE \{ans_rule(20)\} $PERCENT
$BR
b) $c2$PERCENT compounded semiannually
$BR
Answer = $SPACE  \{ans_rule(20)\} $PERCENT

$BBOLD HINT: $EBOLD Use the compound interest formula
\( A = P(1+i)^n \) with \( P= \)$DOLLAR 100
to find \(A\) after 1 year. The interest earned on the $DOLLAR 100
will give you the effective rate of interest.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BBOLD  SOLUTION:  $EBOLD  $PAR
$BBOLD a) $EBOLD Use the compound interest formula
\( A = P(1+i)^n \) with \( P= \)$DOLLAR 100,
\( i = \frac{$r1}{12}\), \( n = 12\)
to find \(A\) after 1 year:
\( A = {$A1:%0.2f}\). 
$BR The interest earned on the $DOLLAR 100
is then \({$ans1:%0.2f}\) and the effective rate of interest
is \(r = {$ans1:%0.2f}\)$PERCENT.
$PAR
$BBOLD b)  $EBOLD
Use the compound interest formula
\( A = P(1+i)^n \) with \( P= \)$DOLLAR 100,
\( i = \frac{$r2}{2}\), \( n = 2\)
to find \(A\) after 1 year:
\( A = {$A2:%0.2f}\). The interest earned on the $DOLLAR 100
is then \({$ans2:%0.2f}\) and the effective rate of interest
is \(r = {$ans2:%0.2f}\)$PERCENT.
