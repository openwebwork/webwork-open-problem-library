How many years will it take to save $DOLLAR$A 
if you place $DOLLAR$P per month in an account that earns  
$c$PERCENT compounded monthly?

Since we are making regular monthly  deposits 
we need to use the annuity formula 
\( A = P \frac{(1+i)^n -1}{i} \) and use logs to solve for  \( n\).
We then divide by 12 to find the number of years.

$i = $r/12;
$n = log($A*$i/$P+1)/log(1+$i);
$ans = log($A*$i/$P+1)/(12*log(1+$i));

$BBOLD SOLUTION: $EBOLD 
$BR
Use the annuity formula \( A = P \frac{(1+i)^n -1}{i} \) with
\(A=$A\), \(P=$P\), \( i = \frac{$r}{12}\) to solve for n.
Substituting the values we have:
\[ $A = $P \frac{(1+\frac{$r}{12})^n -1}{\frac{$r}{12}}. \]
Divide both sides by $P and multiply by \(\frac{$r}{12}\):
\[\frac{$A}{$P}(\frac{$r}{12}) = (1+\frac{$r}{12})^n -1 .\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[ \frac{$A}{$P}(\frac{$r}{12})+ 1 = (1+\frac{$r}{12})^n .  \]
Now take log (or ln) of both sides:
\[ log(\frac{$A}{$P}(\frac{$r}{12})+ 1) = n log(1+\frac{$r}{12}).  \]
Solve for n:
\[ n= \frac{log(\frac{$A}{$P} (\frac{$r}{12})+1)}{log(1+\frac{$r}{12})} 
= {$n:%0.2f}. \]
Divide n by 12 to find the number of years.
