$P = random(2,8,1)*100;

$c = random(3,15,1);
$r = $c/100;

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Mr. Smith wants to save for his son's college education.
If he  deposits $DOLLAR$P each month at
$c$PERCENT compounded monthly,  how much will he have in the account
after $b years?
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

EOT

HINT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BBOLD HINT $EBOLD: Since Mr. Smith is making monthly deposits we need to use
the annuity formula:  \(A=P \frac{(1+i)^n -1} {i} \) to
find \(A\).
$br
EOT

$n = $b*12;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
Substitute \(P=$P\), \(i=\frac{$r}{12}\) , \( n = $n\) in the annuity
formula \(A=P \frac{(1+i)^n -1} {i} \) to
find \(A\).

EOT


$i = $r/12;
$ans = $P*((1+$i)**$n -1)/$i;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
