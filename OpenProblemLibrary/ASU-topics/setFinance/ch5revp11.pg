Bill makes annual deposits of $DOLLAR$P  to an an IRA earning
$c$PERCENT compounded annually for $b1 years.  At the end of the
$b1 years Bill retires.

a) What was the value of his IRA at the end of $b1 years?
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

b) What is the largest amount Bill may withdraw annually for the next $b2 years at $c $PERCENT compounded annually?

$BBOLD HINT: $EBOLD   $PAR
$BBOLD  a) $EBOLD 
Bill  is making regular annual deposits for the first $b1 years,
thus we need to use the annuity formula 
\( A = P \frac{(1+i)^n -1}{i} \) to find \( A\), the value
of his IRA after $b1 years.
$PAR
$BBOLD b) $EBOLD Bill is not making deposits anymore but he wants to make
regular annual withdrawals. We need to use the
Present Value  formula \( V = P \frac{1-(1+i)^{-n} }{i} \) 
using the value found
in part a) as our \( V \).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BBOLD SOLUTION: $EBOLD  $PAR
$BBOLD a) $EBOLD Use the annuity formula \( A = P \frac{(1+i)^n -1}{i} \) with
\( P = $P\), \( i= $r\), \( n = $b1\) to find 
\( A = {$A1:%0.2f} \).
$PAR
$BBOLD b)  $EBOLD
Substituting  
 \( V = {$A1:%0.2f} \), \( i= $r\), \( n = $b2\) in the 
Present Value formula  \( V = P \frac{1-(1+i)^{-n} }{i} \) and 
solving for  \( P\) gives
\[P = \frac{{$A1:%0.2f}($r)}{(1-(1+$r)^{-$b2})} = {$ans2:%0.2f}.\]
