TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Mr. and Mrs. Dunn have just purchased a $DOLLAR$A house and made a down payment of
$DOLLAR$D. They can amortize the balance at $c$PERCENT over $b years.

$BR
a) What are the monthly payments?
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
b) How much interest will be paid?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
c) What is their equity after 5 years?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
d) What is their equity after $be years?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BBOLD a) $EBOLD 
We first find the amount of the loan as V=$DOLLAR$A - $DOLLAR$D= 
$DOLLAR$V.
Since this is an amortized loan we use the Present Value formula
\( V = P \frac{1-(1+i)^{-n} }{i} \) to find the monthly payments \(P\).
$PAR
$BBOLD b) $EBOLD The total interest paid is the total amount paid minus 
the amount of the loan.
$PAR
$BBOLD c) $EBOLD The equity on the house after 5 years is:
(Down payment) + (Amount paid on loan).
$BR
The amount paid on the loan is:
$BR
(original loan amount) - (Present value after 5 years).
$BR
After 5 years there are ($be)12 payments left. Thus to find
the present value we use the present value formula with 
n=($be)12 = $bp . 
$PAR
$BBOLD d) $EBOLD We reason similarly to part c) with n=5(12)=60.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BBOLD SOLUTION:  $EBOLD   $PAR
$BBOLD a) $EBOLD We first find the amount of the loan as 
 V=$DOLLAR$A - $DOLLAR$D= $DOLLAR$V .
$BR
Since this is an amortized loan we use the Present Value formula
\( V = P \frac{1-(1+i)^{-n} }{i} \) with
\(V = $V\), \( i = \frac{$r}{12}\), \(n=$n\) 
to find the monthly payments 
\[P = \frac{$V(\frac{$r}{12})}{1-(1+\frac{$r}{12})^{-$n}} = {$P:%0.2f}. \]

$PAR
$BBOLD b)  $EBOLD
The total interest paid is the total amount paid minus the amount of the loan. The total amount paid is  
\[ {$P:%0.2f}($b)(12)= {$PP:%0.2f},\] thus the interest is
\[ I = {$PP:%0.2f} - $V = {$I:%0.2f} . \]

$PAR
$BBOLD c) $EBOLD
We first find the Present Value after 5 years (this is the amount
on the principal of the loan we still owe). $BR
After 5 years there are \(n = ($be)(12)=$bp \) payments left, thus
the present value is 
\[V= {$P:%0.2f} \frac{1-(1+\frac{$r}{12})^{-$bp}}{\frac{$r}{12}} = {$V5:%0.2f}.\]
$BR
Hence, the amount already paid on the loan is 
\( $V - {$V5:%0.2f} ={$Vo:%0.2f}\).
$BR
The equity on the house after 5 years is:
$BCENTER Equity = (Down payment) + (Amount paid on loan) 
 \( = $D + {$Vo:%0.2f} = {$eq1:%0.2f}.\)  $ECENTER

$PAR
$BBOLD d) $EBOLD
We first find the Present Value after $be years (this is the amount
on the principal of the loan we still owe).  $BR
After $be years there are \(n = (5)(12)=60 \) payments left, thus
the present value is 
\[V= {$P:%0.2f} \frac{1-(1+\frac{$r}{12})^{-60}}{\frac{$r}{12}} = {$Vb:%0.2f}.\]
$BR
Hence, the amount already paid on the loan is \( $V - {$Vb:%0.2f} ={$Vc:%0.2f}\)
$BR
The equity on the house after $be years is:
$BCENTER Equity = (Down payment) + (Amount paid on loan) = 
\($D + {$Vc:%0.2f} = {$eq2:%0.2f}.\) $ECENTER
