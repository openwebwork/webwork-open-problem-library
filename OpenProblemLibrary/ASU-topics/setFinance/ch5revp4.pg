TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
How many years will it take for an initial investment of 
$DOLLAR$P
to grow to $DOLLAR$A? Assume a rate of interest of $c$PERCENT 
compounded daily.
$BR
Answer =  \{ans_rule(20)\} years
$BR
EOT

HINT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BBOLD HINT: $EBOLD Use the compound interest formula
\( A=P(1+i)^n .\)
You will have to use logs to solve for \(n\) and then divide by
365 to find the number of years. 
$BR
EOT

$n=log($A/$P)/log(1+$r/365);
$ans = log($A/$P)/(365*log(1+$r/365));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION  $EBOLD:
$BR
First substitute \(A = $A,\)
\(P = $P \), \( i = \frac{$r}{365} \) in  \( A=P(1+i)^n \).$BR
Now we need to solve for \(n\). $BR
Divide both sides by $P:
\[\frac{$A}{$P}= (1+\frac{$r}{365})^n ,\]  take  log or ln of
both sides and apply the property of logs about exponents:
\[ log(\frac{$A}{$P})= n log(1+\frac{$r}{365}) .\]
Solve for n: 
\[n =\frac{log($A/$P)}{log(1+$r/365)} = {$n:%0.2f}.\]
The answer is then \( t = {$n:%0.2f}/365 = {$ans:%0.2f}\)
