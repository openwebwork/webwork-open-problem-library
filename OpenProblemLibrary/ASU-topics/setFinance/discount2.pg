TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A toy store owner would like to borrow $DOLLAR$a from a bank to increase
her stock.  The bank will give the owner a discounted loan for $b months
at an interest rate of $c$PERCENT.  What maturity value should be used so
that the owner will receive $DOLLAR$a?

Maturity Value = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(40)\}

HINT(EV2(<<EOT));
Use the formula for discounted interest:
\( A(1-rt) = P \).

Good Job! $PAR
I see you used \[  A(1-rt) = P \]
subsituting \( P=$a\), \(r = $c/100\), and \(t = $b/12\).
