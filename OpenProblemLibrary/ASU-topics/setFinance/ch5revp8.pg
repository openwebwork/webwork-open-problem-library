TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A company establishes a sinking fund to pay off a debt of $DOLLAR$A
due in $b years. The sinking fund will earn $c$PERCENT compounded weekly.
Find the amount of the weekly deposits into the fund.

$BBOLD HINT: $EBOLD 
Since the company is making regular weekly deposits into a sinking fund
we need to use the annuity formula 
\( A = P \frac{(1+i)^n -1}{i} \) 
to find the amount of the weekly deposits \( P\).

$ans = $A*($r/52)/((1+$r/52)**(52*$b)-1);
$bw=$b*52;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BBOLD SOLUTION: $EBOLD  $BR
Substituting \(A=$A\), \( i = \frac{$r}{52} \), \(n=52($b)=$bw\) into the 
annuity formula \( A = P \frac{(1+i)^n -1}{i} \)  and solving
for \(P\) gives: 
\[P = \frac{$A (\frac{$r}{52})}{(1+\frac{$r}{52})^{$bw}-1}= {$ans:%0.2f}.\]
