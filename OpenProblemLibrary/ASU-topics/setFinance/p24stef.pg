TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A couple has decided to purchase a $DOLLAR$A house using a down payment of
$DOLLAR$D. They can amortize the balance at $c$PERCENT over $b years.

$BR
a) What is their monthly payment?
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
b) What is the total interest paid?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
c) What is the equity after 5 years?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
d) What is the equity after $be years?
