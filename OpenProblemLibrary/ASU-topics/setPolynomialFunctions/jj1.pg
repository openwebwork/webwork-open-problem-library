BEGIN_TEXT
A market analyst finds that if a company produces and sells \(x\) $app annually, the total profit in dollars is
\[ P(x) = $fun \]
Graph the function \(P\) in an appropriate viewing rectangle and use the graph
to answer the following.
$BR$BR
When just a few $app are produced, the company loses money (i.e., profit is
negative).  For example \(P(10) = $ten\), so the company loses $DOLLAR$tenf if it
produces and sells only 10 $app.  How many $app must the company produce to break
even?
	$BR$BR
	Number of $app = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR$HR$BR
Does the profit increase indefinitely as more $app are produced and sold, or is there a largest possible profit the firm could earn?  If there is a maximum profit, enter that
value.  If profit could increase indefinitely, enter ${BITALIC}None$EITALIC.
$BR$BR
Maximum profit = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(40)\}
