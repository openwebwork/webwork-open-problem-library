If a ball is thrown straight up into the air with an initial
velocity of \( $v0 \) ft/s, its height in feet after \( t \)
second is given by \( y = {$v0}t - 16t^2 \).  Find the average
velocity (include units) for the time period begining when \( t = $t0 \) seconds and
lasting  $BR (i) \( 0.5 \) seconds
