Recall that to find the cost to produce the nth unit in a production process, we calculate the difference 
$BR\[ C(n-1) - C(n) .\] 
$BR
This works well when do a small production run. However suppose we wanted 
to talk about the costs associated with large or long runs. Take the 
popular hamburger franchise with golden arches. The total cost (in dollars) 
of producing \(x\) million hamburgers might be 
$BR
$BR
\[ C(x) = $a + $b x - $c x^2. \]
$BR
$BR
(A) Find the exact cost of producing the 2,000,001st burger. Be careful 
though. The units for \(x\) are millions of units. The 2,000,001st 
burger is represented by 2.000001!
$BR
$BR
Exact cost of 2,000,001st burger = \{ans_rule(75) \}
$BR
$BR
EOT

$ans = ($a + $b*2.001 - $c*((2.000001)**2)) - ($a + $b*2.000 - $c*((2.000000)**2));
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
(B) Use marginal cost to approximate the cost of producing the 2000001st burger.
$BR
$BR
Approx. cost of 2000001st burger = \{ans_rule(75) \}
$BR
$BR
EOT

$ans = $b - $c*2*20;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
