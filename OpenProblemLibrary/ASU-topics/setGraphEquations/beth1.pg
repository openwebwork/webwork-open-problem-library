BEGIN_TEXT
For the equation
\[y = $a |x| + $b\]
answer the following questions:
$PAR
What are the \(x\)-intercept(s) written as ordered pair(s)?
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
  If there is more than one write them separated by a comma (i.e.: (1,2),(3,4)).
If there are none, type $BITALIC none $EITALIC in the answer blank.
$BR
\(x\)-intercept(s): \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
What is the \(y\)-intercept written as an ordered pair?
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
  If there is more than one write them separated by a comma (i.e.: (1,2),(3,4)).
If there are none, type $BITALIC none $EITALIC in the answer blank.
$BR
\(y\)-intercept: \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Is the graph symmetric with respect to the \(x\)-axis? ($BITALIC yes $EITALIC or $BITALIC no $EITALIC) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
Is the graph symmetric with respect to the \(y\)-axis? ($BITALIC yes $EITALIC or $BITALIC no $EITALIC) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? ($BITALIC yes $EITALIC or $BITALIC no $EITALIC) \{ans_rule(10)\}
