BEGIN_TEXT
 This problem demonstrates a WeBWorK problem involving graphics. $PAR
 The most important thing to remember when a problem contains a graphic is
that you can get a better look at it by clicking on the graphic.  This
will open a new window from your browser containing a enlarged version
of the picture.
  $PAR
This will be a matching question.
 Enter the letter of the graph of the function which corresponds to 
   each statement.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This is another problem where you aren't told if some of your answers are right. (With
matching questions and true false questions, this is the standard behavior -- otherwise
it is too easy to guess your way to the answer without learning anything.)
$PAR
If you are having a hard time seeing the picture clearly, click on the picture.  It will
expand to a larger picture on its own page so that you can inspect it more closely.
$PAR
Occasionally,
 problems display a link to a web page where you can get additional information 
or a hint:\{ htmlLink(alias("testing.html"),"Hint")\}

Now that you have finished you can use the "Prob. List" button at the top of the page
to return to the problem list page.  You'll see that the problems you have done have been
labeled as correct or incorrect, so you can go back and do problems you skipped or
couldn't
get right the first time.  Once you have done a problem correctly it is 
ALWAYS listed as correct
even if you go back and do it incorrectly later.  This means you can use WeBWorK 
to review course material without any danger of changing your grade.
