WeBWorK knows most of the standard mathematical functions.  It can compute base
10 logarithms with log and natural logarithms with ln.  If your course involves
trigonometric functions, it can evaluate those as well.  Note, for trig functions WeBWorK always uses radian mode.
Here's the 
\{ htmlLink(qq!http://webwork.asu.edu/availableFunctions.html!,"list of the functions") \}
 which WeBWorK understands, (many of which you will not need for your course).
 $BR$BR
To try one, we will use the \(\ln\) function (natural logarithm).
Compute \( 2\ln(5e/3) \).
$BR $BR 
Answer = \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR$BR
You can enter this as 2*ln(5*e/3) or more simply as 2ln(5e/3).
Those who have studied logarithms before may also recognize that
we could enter this as \(2 + \ln(25/9)\), which also works.

Sometimes you need to use ( )'s to make your meaning clear. E.g. 1/2+3 is 3.5, but  1/(2+3) is .2 Why?
Try entering both and use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button below to see the difference.  In addition to
( )'s, you can also use [ ]'s and \(\lbrace \rbrace\).  
$BR$BR
\( (1/2) + 3 = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

When entering numbers, leave off units (or dollar signs for money) unless the
problem directs you to do otherwise.  For example, if we want to know how much money you
will have if you collect ${DOLLAR}100 from 200 people, the answer is 
${DOLLAR}20,000.
When entering this value, you should just give 20000 
(or 100*200, or anything else
which evaluates to 20000).
$BR$BR
${DOLLAR}100 from 200 people yields  \{ ans_rule(20) \} dollars
$BR$BR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD it is important to leave out the comma.  Commas are
used when an answer is a list of things.
