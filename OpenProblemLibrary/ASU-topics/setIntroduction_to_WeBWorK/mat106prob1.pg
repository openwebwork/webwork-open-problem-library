This problem set demonstrates how you enter numerical answers into WeBWorK. 

$PAR

In these problems you need to enter a number, since we're checking whether you can does these calculations. Do the calculation, then enter the correct numerical result in the box provided. 

$PAR

$BBOLD Warning: $EBOLD While you might use a calculator here, you may not be allowed a calculator on some of your tests.

$PAR

END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
Evaluate the expression \(0($a)(-2($d ))\):   \{ ans_rule(5) \}

$PAR

END_TEXT

$ans = 0*($a)*(-2*($d))  ;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>"strict"))     ;

BEGIN_TEXT

Evaluate the expression \(  $a ($b )($c + $d)  \):   \{ ans_rule(10) \}

ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>"strict"))     ;

Evaluate the expression \(  ($a + $b )($c + 12 ($d))  \):   \{ ans_rule(5) \}

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>"strict"))       ;

$PAR

For some problems, you will be able to get WeBWorK to do some of the work for you.  

$PAR

For example, calculate ($a) * ($b): \{ ans_rule()\}

$PAR

END_TEXT

$ans = $a*$b;

ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR

The asterisk is how most calculators and computers show multiplication and you can use this with WeBWorK. But WeBWorK will also allow you to use a space to show multiplication. You can either \($a * $b\) or \{$a*$b\}.  All will work. Try them.

$PAR
$HR
$PAR

Now try calculating  $SPACE \( \sqrt{7}\)$SPACE,  the square root of 7.

$PAR

You can enter this as sqrt(7), or as 7$CARET(1/2).  This is because
WeBWorK knows about standard calculations like square root, and that roots can
be represented using fractional exponents. You'll study this in detail very shortly.  

$PAR

Note, exponents can be entered with either
a $CARET (caret) or ** (two asterisks).
Try it in the box below.

$PAR

\( \sqrt{7} = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
$HR
$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("sqrt(7)") );

BEGIN_TEXT

When it is very clear that only multiplication is involved, you can simpley write two characters together

$PAR

E.g., enter the square root of 5 divided 3.
You can enter this as 2*sqrt(5/3) or more simply as 2sqrt(5/3).  Try it:

$PAR

\( 2\sqrt{5/3} =  \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp("2*sqrt(5/3)") );

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR
$HR
$PAR

Think about the problem above. How sure are you that we should divide 5 by 3 then take the square root. If we are verablizing the process, we could say "divide 5 by 3 then take the square root of the result." It is a little longer to say, but very clear. In written math (symbology) sometimes you need to use ( )'s to make your meaning clear. 

$PAR

E.g. 1/2+3 is 3.5, but  1/(2+3) is .2 Why?
Try entering both and use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button below to see the difference.  In addition to ( )'s, you can also use [ ]'s and \(\lbrace \rbrace\).  

$PAR

\( (1/2) + 3 = \)\{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR

Now go back to the previous problem and enter 2sqrt5/3 instead of 2sqrt(5/3).  Use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button to see how WeBWorK interprets the symbology. 

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp(3.5));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
$HR
$PAR

When entering numbers, leave off units (or dollar signs for money) unless the
problem directs you to do otherwise.

$PAR

For example, if we want to know how much money you will have if you collect $DOLLAR 100 from 200 people, the answer is $DOLLAR 20,000.

$PAR

When entering this value, you should just give 20000 (or 100*200). 

$PAR

When doing WeBWorK problems alsways look "outside the (answer) box." If the problems has units associated, they are usually provided. Don't include the stuff already provided outside the box!

$PAR

$DOLLAR 100 from 200 people yields $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
$HR
$PAR

You can always try to enter answers and let WeBWorK do the calculating. After a little experience, you may find that the WeBWorK preview lets you "see" the answer you would type into your calculator in the same form as a textbook or a correctly expression. It is a great way to find mistakes like omitted parentheses or incorrect grouping.

$PAR

Or, if you have trouble with the syntax while entering expressions, you
can compute most answers on yourself then type the answer into
WeBWorK.  If you do, just be sure to include lots of decimal places
(including the first 5 non-zero places should be safe).

$PAR

$BBOLD In general, there is no penalty for getting an answer wrong.$EBOLD  If you
are limited in the number of attempts you get for a problem, you will
be warned by the problem itself (this could happen, for example, on a
true/false question).  What counts is that you get the answer right
before the due date. 

$PAR

$BBOLD However, $EBOLD even though you get a "correct" from WeBWorK, if that answer comes from an invalid mathematical process (in relation to your problem), your instructor will almost certainly catch it in written work! Be certain you understand the process and can write the steps for each problem answered in correctly.

$PAR
	
$BBOLD Remember: $EBOLD For complicated answers you should use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button to check for syntax errors and also to check that the answer you enter is really what you think it is.
