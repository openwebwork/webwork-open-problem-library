This problem will review the rules of precedence, i.e. the order in
which mathematical operations are performed. You can use parentheses
(and also square brackets [ ] and/or curly braces \(\lbrace \rbrace\)) if you want
to change the normal way operations work.$PAR

The rules are simple.  Exponentiation is always done before multiplication 
and division, and multiplication and division are always done before addition 
and subtraction. (Mathematically we say exponentiation takes precedence over 
multiplication and division, etc.). For example what is 1+2*3?
	$BR
	$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD you must compute this number before entering it
	into WeBWorK.

	$BR
1+2*3 = \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$ans = 7;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>'strict'));


BEGIN_TEXT
$BR
	What is \( 2\cdot 3^2 \)?  \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
	$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD you must compute this number before entering it
	into WeBWorK.
END_TEXT

$ans = 2*3**2;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>'strict'));

Now sometimes you want to force things to be done in a different way. This is
what parentheses are used for.  The rule is: whatever is enclosed in 
parentheses is done before anything else (and things in the inner most
parentheses are done first). 

For example, enter the following expression:
	\[ \frac {1+\log(3)}{2+\sqrt{5}}  \]
$BBOLD  Hint: $EBOLD this is a good place to use
[ ]'s and also to use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button. $BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = "(1+log(3))/(2+sqrt(5))" ;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

Here are some more examples:

(1+3)9 =36, (2*3)**2 = 6**2 = 36, 3**(2*2) = 3**4 = 81,
	(2+3)**2 = 5**2 = 25, 3**(2+2) = 3**4 = 81
$BR
(Here we have used ** to denote exponentiation and you can also use this instead of a ${LQ}caret${RQ} if you want).  Try entering some of these and use the "Preview" button to see the result.  The "correct"
result for this answer blank is 36, but by using the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button, you can enter whatever 
you want and use WeBWorK as a hand calculator.$BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}

END_TEXT

$ans =36;

ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

There is one other thing to be careful of.  Multiplication and
division have the same precedence.  For example, what does 2/3*4 mean?
(Note that / is the "division symbol", which is sometimes written as a
line with two dots. Don't think of / as the horizontal line in a
fraction. Ask yourself what 1/2/2 should mean.)  Multiplication and
divsion are evaluated from left to right, i.e., 2/3*4 means (2/3)*4 or
8/3, IT DOES NOT MEAN 2/12.  If you want 2/(3*4) = 2/12, you have to
use parentheses.

 $PAR

The same thing happens with addition and subtraction. 1-3+2 = 0 but
1-(3+2) = -4. This is one case where using parentheses even if they
are not needed might be a good idea, e.g. write (2/3)*4 even though
you could write 2/3*4. This is also a case where previewing your
answer can save you a lot a grief since you will be able to see what
you entered.

$BR
Enter 2/3*4 and use the Preview button to see what you get.$BR
