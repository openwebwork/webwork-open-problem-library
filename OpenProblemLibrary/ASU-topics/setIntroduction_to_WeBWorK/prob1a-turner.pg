<B>WeBWorK can accept a number, mathematical expression or even a complete sentence. In this example you are asked to enter a mathematical expression. It wants you to type in (x+2)^2. You will study this problem in a later lesson.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider a function f(x)=x^2. This is the squaring rule. It says "take a number and square it."
<BR>
<BR>
If the graph of a new function g(x)is the graph of f(x) shifted to the left 2 units, what is the algebraic expression for the function g(x)?
<BR>
<BR>
g(x) = 
\{ans_rule(20) \}
