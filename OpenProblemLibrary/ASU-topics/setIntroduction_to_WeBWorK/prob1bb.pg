Now try calculating the square root of 7.
You can enter this as sqrt(7), or as 7$CARET(1/2).  This is because
WeBWorK knows about functions like sqrt (square root), and that roots can
be taken using exponents.  Note, exponents can be entered with either
a $CARET (caret).
Try it.
$BR  $BR  
\( \sqrt{7} = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR$BR  
Here, you could also compute \(\sqrt{7}\) on your calculator and enter the
value you get.  When entering decimal approximations like this, be sure to
give at least five significant digits (significant digits start with the first non-zero digit).  So, here 2.64 will be marked wrong but 2.6457 will be marked right.

For complicated answers you should use the ${BITALIC}Preview Answers${EITALIC}
button to check for syntax errors and also to check that the answer
you enter is really what you think it is.  For example, it will help you
spot some cases where you need more parentheses, or if parentheses are
not matching up the way you wanted.
