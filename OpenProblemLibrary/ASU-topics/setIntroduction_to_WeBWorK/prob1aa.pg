BEGIN_TEXT
These introductory problems are much ${LQ}talkier$RQ than most WeBWorK
problems because they are explaining the system, instead of just presenting
a homework question.  Work through them, and it will pay dividends for the
rest of the semester.
$BR$BR
When you submit an answer to WeBWorK, it will tell you if the answer is
right or wrong.  If it is right, great!  If it is wrong, you can rework
the problem and submit again.  You can get full credit for a problem by
submitting the correct answers at any time up until the due date/time.
So, don't worry about losing credit here
for experimenting with different answers.  Part of the point of these
first few problems is to get used to entering answers.
Once you have a problem right, you can work on it again later (maybe for review).  If you then enter the wrong answer, WeBWorK will tell you that the
new submission is wrong, but you won't loose credit already earned.
$BR$BR
Occasionally, a problem will limit how many attempts you get, for example,
on a true/false question.  In that case, you will
be warned by the problem itself.

BEGIN_TEXT
Many WeBWorK problems ask questions where the answer is a number.
For example, 
$BR$BR
\($a \cdot $b\) = \{ ans_rule(20)\}
$BR$BR
You can enter the number and submit your answer.
$BR$BR
In almost all problems where the answer is a number,
you will be able to get WeBWorK to
do calculations for you.  For example,
you can either \($a * $b\) or \($ans\) or even \($aa - 7\).  All will work.
Try them.  (Note, The asterisk is what most computers use to denote multiplication and you can use this with WeBWorK.)
