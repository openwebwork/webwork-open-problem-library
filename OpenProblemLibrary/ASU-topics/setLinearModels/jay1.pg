BEGIN_TEXT
The value of a car in 1990 is $a dollars and the value is  
expected to go down by $b dollars per year for the next 
$c years.  
$PAR
Write a linear equation for the value of the 1990 car, where \(V \)
is the value of the car after \(x \) years from 1990.  

$PAR
\(V =\) \{ ans_rule(30)\} dollars

$PAR
$PAR
What is the smallest value possible for \(x\)?    
	 \{ ans_rule(30)\}
$PAR
What is the largest value possible for \(x\)?  
	\{ ans_rule(30)\}
