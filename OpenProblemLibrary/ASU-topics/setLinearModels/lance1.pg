BEGIN_TEXT
A contractor purchases a backhoe for $DOLLAR$b.  Fuel and standard maintenance cost
$DOLLAR$mstr per hour, and the operator is paid $DOLLAR$w per hour.
	$PAR 
a. Write a cost function for the cost \( C \) of operating the backhoe for \( x \) hours.  Be sure to include the purchase price in the cost function.  
	$PAR 
	Cost equation:  \( C \) = \{ans_rule(40)\}dollars
	$PAR
b. If customers pay $DOLLAR$p per hour for the contractor's backhoe service, write the 
revenue function \( R \) for the amount of revenue gained from \( x \) hours of use.
	$PAR
	Revenue equation:  \( R \) = \{ans_rule(40)\}dollars
	$PAR
c. Write the profit function \( P \) for the amount of $BITALIC profit $EITALIC gained 
from \( x \) hours of use.
	$PAR
	Profit equation:  \( P \) = \{ans_rule(40)\} dollars
	$PAR
d. Use part c. to find the number of hours the backhoe must be used to break even (when 
Profit = 0).  Please make sure your answer is correct to at least the nearest whole 
number.
	$PAR
	Break even = \{ans_rule(40)\} hours.
