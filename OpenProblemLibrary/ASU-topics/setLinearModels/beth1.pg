#pick a base wage

#pick the pay per unit
$u = random(.25,1.25,.01);

BEGIN_TEXT
A manufacturer pays its assembly line workers $DOLLAR$W per hour.  In addition, workers receive a piece work rate
of $DOLLAR$u per unit produced.  Write a linear equation for the hourly wages \(W\) in terms
of the number of units \(x\) produced per hour.
	$PAR
	linear equation:  \(W =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
What is the hourly wage for Mike, who produces $n units in one hour?
$BR
Mike's wage = \{ans_rule(10)\}

# Tell WeBWork how to test if answers are right.  These should come in the

# "answer evaluator" to use, and the correct answer.
