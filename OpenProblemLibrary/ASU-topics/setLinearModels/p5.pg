#So, what is a linear model?  
#Well, all linear models have a "starting value" and a "constant rate of change".
#A linear function has the form \[y=mx + b ,\] 
#where the "starting point" is given by the \(b\) 
#and the "constant rate of change" is given by \(m\).

Initially, you have lost 20,000 dollars in the stock market

thus your balance is - $a?
