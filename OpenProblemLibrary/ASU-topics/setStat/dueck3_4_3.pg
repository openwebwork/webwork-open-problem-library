Here is a list of 27 scores on a Statistics midterm exam: 

[$tab]* 

Find the [$quartName[$n1]] =  [_]{$quartile[$n1]}{10}

Find the [$quartName[$n2]] =  [_]{$quartile[$n2]}{10}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
If [`n`] numbers are listed in increasing order the percentile rank
of the [`i`]-th number is [`(i/(n+1])\times 100`].   In this exercise [`n+1=28`]
 so the 7th number is the the 25th percentile, the 14th 
number is the 50th percentile, and the 21st number is the 75th percentile.  If 
[`n+1`] were not a multiple of 4 then the situation is more complicated because 25, 50, or 75 may not equal the percentiles of numbers in the data.  In that case computing the quartiles requires selecting from a list of interpolation methods which can produce slightly different results.
See [@ htmlLink("https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc262.htm", "NIST Engineering Statists Handbook") @]* for a discussion.
