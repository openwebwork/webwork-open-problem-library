Two polls were conducted about the upcoming election for new governor. The first poll said that \( $p1 \)$PERCENT of the people asked would vote 
for Mr. Johnson with a margin of error of plus or minus \(  $e1 \)$PERCENT. The second poll said that \( $p2 \)$PERCENT of the people asked would vote 
for Mr. Johnson with a margin of error of plus or minus \(  $e2 \)$PERCENT.  $BR $BR
