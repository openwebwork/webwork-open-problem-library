1.  Suppose a group of $n smokers (who all wanted to give up smoking) were randomly assigned to receive an
antidepressant drug or a placebo for six weeks.  Of the $n1 patients who received the
antidepressant drug, $x1 were not smoking one year later.  Of the $n2
patients who
received the placebo, $x2 were not smoking one year later.  Given the null hypothesis \(H_0:  p_1 = p_2 \) and the alternative hypothesis \(H_a: p_1 \ne p_2 \), conduct a test to see
if taking an antidepressant drug can help smokers stop smoking.  Use \(\alpha = $alpha\) $BR $BR
