A recent poll of \($n\) randomly selected 18-25-year-olds revealed that \($x\) currently use marijuana or hashish. According to a publication, \($phat\) $PERCENT of 18-25-year-olds were current users of marijuana or hashish in 1997. Do the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the percentage of 18-25-year-olds who currently use marijuana or hashish has changed from the 1997 percentage of \($phat\)$PERCENT?
