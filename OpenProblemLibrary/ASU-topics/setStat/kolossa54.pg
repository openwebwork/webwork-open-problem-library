BEGIN_TEXT
According to a recent marketing campaign, \($n\) drinkers of either Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi participated in a
blind taste test to see which of the drinks was their favorite.  In one Pepsi television commercial, an 
anouncer states that "in recent blind taste tests, more than one half
of the surveyed preferred Diet Pepsi over Diet Coke."  Suppose that out of those \($n\), \($n1\)
preferred Diet Pepsi.  Test the hypothesis, using \(\alpha = $a\) that more than half of all participants will select Diet Pepsi
in a blind taste test by giving the following: $BR
(a) \( \ \) the test statistic \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(b) \( \ \) the critical \(z\) score \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
$PAR
\{ $mc->print_q() \}
$PAR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
