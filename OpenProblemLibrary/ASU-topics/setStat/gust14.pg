Suppose that a variable of a population has a right skewed distribution and that two separate samples are taken from the population. $BR

$PAR
a)  Would you expect the distributions of the two samples to have roughly the same shape? (Answer yes or no)$BR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
If so, what shape? $BR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR
b)  Woud you expect some variation in shape for the distributions of the two samples?  (Answer yes or no) $BR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR
