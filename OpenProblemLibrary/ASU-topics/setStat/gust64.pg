BEGIN_TEXT

A variable of two populations has a mean of $mean1 and a standard deviation of $stdev1 for one of the populations and a mean of $mean2 and a standard deviation of $stdev2 for the other population. $BR

$PAR
a)  For independent samples of sizes $n1 and $n2, respectively, find the mean and standard deviation of  \( \overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2\).$BR
mean: \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
standard deviation: \{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR

b)  Can you conclude that the variable  \(\overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2\) is approximately normally distributed?  (Answer yes or no) $BR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR
