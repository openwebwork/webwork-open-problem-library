BEGIN_TEXT
A variable of a population has a mean of \(\mu = $mu \) and a standard deviation of \(\sigma= $sigma \).
$PAR
a. The sampling distribution of the sample mean for samples of size 49 is approximately normally distributed with mean \{ans_rule(10)\} and standard deviation \{ans_rule(10)\}.

$PAR
b.
\{ $m->print_q \}
$BR
\{ $m->print_a \}

$PAR
c.
\{ $m1->print_q \}
$BR
\{ $m1->print_a \}
