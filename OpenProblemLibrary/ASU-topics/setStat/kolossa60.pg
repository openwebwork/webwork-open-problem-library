1.  In a study of red/green color blindness, \( $n1 \) men and \( $n2 \) women are randomly
selected and tested. Among the men, \( $x1 \) have red/green color blindness. Among the 
women, \( $x2 \) have red/green color blindness. Test the claim that men have a higher 
rate of red/green color blindness. $BR

The test statistic is \{ ans_rule(50) \} $BR
The p-value is \{ ans_rule(50) \} $BR

\{$mc->print_q()\}$BR
\{$mc->print_a()\}$BR

2.  Construct the \($p\)$PERCENT confidence interval for the difference between the color 
blindness rates of men and women. $BR
