BEGIN_TEXT
A random sample of elementary school children in New York state is to be
selected to estimate the proportion \(p\) who have received a medical
examination during the past year.  An interval estimate of the proportion \(p\)
with a margin of error of \($b\) and $sconf[0] confidence is required. $PAR
(a) \( \ \) Assuming no prior information about \(\hat{p}\) is available,
approximately how large of a sample size is needed? $BR
\( n = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \ \) If a planning study indicates that \(\hat{p}\) is around \($p\),
approximately how large of a sample size is needed? $BR
\( n = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
