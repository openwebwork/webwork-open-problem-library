BEGIN_TEXT
The ability of lizards to recognize their predators via tongue flicks can often mean life or death for lizards.  Seventeen juvenile common lizards were exposed to the chemical cues of the viper snake.  Their responses, in number of tongue flicks per 20 minutes, are presented below. $PAR

$a1, $a2, $a3, $a4, $a5, $a6, $a7, $a8, $a9, $a10, $BR $a11, $a12, $a13, $a14, $a15, $a16, $a17

$PAR
a)  Preliminary data analyses indicate that you can reasonably apply the z-interval procedure.  Find a 90$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean number of tongue flicks per 20 minutes for all juvenile common lizards.  Assume a population standard deviation of 190.0.  Note:  The sum of the data is $sum.  $BR 
Confidence interval: (\{ans_rule(10)\},\{ans_rule(10)\}). $BR

$PAR
b)  
\{ $mc->print_q \}
\{ $mc->print_a \}
