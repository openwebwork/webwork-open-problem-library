If the average low temperature of a winter month in Rochester, NY is \($temp^{\circ} \) and the standard
deviation is \($sd\), then according to Chebyshev's theorem, the percentage of averages low temperatures in
Rochester, NY between \($b1^{\circ} \) and \($b2^{\circ} \) is \{ans_rule(3)\} $PERCENT.
