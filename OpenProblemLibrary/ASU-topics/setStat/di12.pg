BEGIN_PGML
Consider the following hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is
_The mean body temperature for humans is 98.6 degrees Farenheit,_
and the alternative hypothesis is _The mean body temperature for humans
differs from 98.6 degrees Farenheit._

Answer the following questions.

a. [$questions[$order[0]]]**

    [_]{$radios[$order[0]]}

b. [$questions[$order[1]]]**

    [_]{$radios[$order[1]]}

c. [$questions[$order[2]]]**

    [_]{$radios[$order[2]]}

c. [$questions[$order[3]]]**

    [_]{$radios[$order[3]]}
