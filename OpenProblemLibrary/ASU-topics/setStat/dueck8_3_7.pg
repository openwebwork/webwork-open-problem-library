BEGIN_TEXT

The standard IQ test is designed so that the mean is \( 100 \) and the standard deviation 
is \( 15 \) for the population of all adults. We wish to find the sample size necessary to 
estimate the mean IQ score of statistics students. Suppose we want to be \( $p\)$PERCENT  
confident that our sample mean is within \( $a \) IQ points of the true mean. 
Assume then that \( \sigma = 15\) and determine the required sample size. (Be sure to round correctly!)$PAR

Answer: \{ ans_rule(20) \}
