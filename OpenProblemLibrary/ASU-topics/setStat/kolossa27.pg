BEGIN_TEXT

The age distribution for senators in the 104th U.S. Congress was as follows: $BR
\{begintable(6)\}
\{row("age", "under 40", "40-49", "50-59", "60-69", "70 and over")\} 
\{row("no. of senators", "1", "14", "41", "27", "17")\} 
\{endtable()\}  $BR $BR

Consider the following four events:    $BR  $BR

\(A\) = event the senator is under 40  $BR
\(B\) = event the senator is in his or her 50s  $BR
\(C\) = event the senator is 40 or older  $BR
\(D\) = event the senator is under 60 $BR  $BR


Find the probability of each event given below: $PAR  $BR

(a)  $sevent[0] = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b)  $sevent[1] = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) $sevent[2] = \{ans_rule(10)\}   $PAR
(d)   $sevent[3] = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(e)  $sevent[4] = \{ans_rule(10)\}
