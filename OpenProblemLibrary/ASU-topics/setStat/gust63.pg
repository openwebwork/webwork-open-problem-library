1.  Suppose that for a given data set, a 95 $PERCENT confidence interval is calculated to be (-3.45,1.78).  If you were to perform a hypothesis test at the 5 $PERCENT significance level to test the null hypothesis: \(H_0:\mu_1 = \mu_2\) versus the alternative hypothesis: \(H_a:\mu_1 \ne \mu_2\), would you reject \(H_0\)?  Answer "yes", "no", or "can't tell".  $BR \{ans_rule(15)\} $PAR

2.  Suppose that for a given data set, a 99 $PERCENT confidence interval is calculated to be (-10.77,-2.35).  If you were to perform a hypothesis test at the 1 $PERCENT significance level to test the null hypothesis: \(H_0:\mu_1 = \mu_2\) versus the alternative hypothesis: \(H_a:\mu_1 \ne \mu_2\), would you reject \(H_0\)?  Answer "yes", "no", or "can't tell".  $BR \{ans_rule(15)\} $PAR

3.  Suppose that for a given data set, a 97 $PERCENT confidence interval is calculated to be (25.6,41.1).  If you were to perform a hypothesis test at the 3 $PERCENT significance level to test the null hypothesis: \(H_0:\mu_1 = \mu_2\) versus the alternative hypothesis: \(H_a:\mu_1 \ne \mu_2\), would you reject \(H_0\)?  Answer "yes", "no", or "can't tell".  $BR \{ans_rule(15)\} $PAR
