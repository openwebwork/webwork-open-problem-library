BEGIN_TEXT

As reported in "Runner's World" magazine, the times of the finishers in the New York City 10 km run are normally distributed with a mean of 61 minutes and a standard deviation of 9 minutes.  Let x denote finishing time for the finishers.$BR

$PAR
a)  The distribution of the variable x has mean \{ans_rule(20)\} and standard deviation  \{ans_rule(20)\}. $BR

$PAR
b)  The distribution of the standardized variable z has mean \{ans_rule(20)\} and standard deviation  \{ans_rule(20)\}. $BR

$PAR
c)  The percentage of finishers with times between $time1 and $time2 minutes is equal to the area under the standard normal curve between \{ans_rule(20)\} and \{ans_rule(20)\}. $BR

$PAR
d)  The percentage of finishers with times exceeding $time3 minutes is equal to the area under the standard normal curve that lies to the \{ans_rule(20)\} of \{ans_rule(20)\}.
