(a) A random sample of elementary school children in New York state is to be
selected to estimate the proportion \(p\) who have received a medical
examination during the past year.  The survey found that \( x = $x \) children were examined during the past year. Construct the \( $perc\)$PERCENT confidence interval estimate of the population proportion 
\( p \) if the sample size was \( n = $n \) .
