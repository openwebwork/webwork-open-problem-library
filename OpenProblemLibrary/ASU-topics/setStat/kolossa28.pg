# Now we do the randomization of variables, and other computations

BEGIN_TEXT
A variable of a population has a mean of \(\mu = $mu \) and a standard deviation of \(\sigma= $sigma \).
$PAR
The sampling distribution of the sample mean for samples of size 81 is approximately normally distributed with mean \{ans_rule(10)\} and standard deviation \{ans_rule(10)\}.
