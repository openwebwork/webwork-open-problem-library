In each question below, we have given the relative frequencies for the null hypothesis of a chi-square goodness-of-fit test and the sample size.  In each case, decide whether the two assumptions for using that test are satisfied.
$PAR

Assumption 1:  All expected frequencies are 1 or greater $BR
Assumption 2:  At most 20 percent of the expected frequencies are less than 5
