Physicians at a clinic gave what they thought were drugs to \($n\) patients.  Although the doctors later learned that the drugs
were really placebos, \($a\) $PERCENT of the patients reported an improved
condition.  Assume that if the placebo is ineffective, the probability of a
patients condition improving is \($p\).  Test the hypotheses that the proportion
of patients improving is \(>$p\). $BR $BR 

Find the test statistics: $BR $BR
