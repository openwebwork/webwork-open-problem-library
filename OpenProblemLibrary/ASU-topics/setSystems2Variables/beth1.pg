BEGIN_TEXT
A company that makes thing-a-ma-bobs has a start up cost of ${DOLLAR}$a.
It costs the company ${DOLLAR}$bstr to make each
thing-a-ma-bob.  The company charges ${DOLLAR}$cstr for each thing-a-ma-bob.
Let \(x\) denote the number of thing-a-ma-bobs produced.
	$BR$BR
Write the cost function for this company. $BR
	\(C(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
        $BR$BR
Write the revenue function for this company. $BR
        \(R(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
        $BR$BR
What is the minumum number of thing-a-ma-bobs that the company must produce and sell to make a profit?
        \{ans_rule(40)\}
