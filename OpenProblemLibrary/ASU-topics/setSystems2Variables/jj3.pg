A hill is inclined so that its "slope" is \(\frac{1}{2}\), as shown in the
figure.

We introduce a coordinate system with the origin
at the base of the hill and with the scales on the axes measured in meters.
A rocket is fired from the base of the hill in such a way that its trajectory
is the
parabola \(y = -x^2 + $a x\).  At what point does the rocket hit the hillside?  Give your
answer in terms of \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates.

\(x = \) \{ ans_rule(30) \}

How far is this point, measured on a straight line, from the launch spot?

Distance = \{ ans_rule(40) \} meters
