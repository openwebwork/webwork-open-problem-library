Find all solutions of the system
\[
\begin{array}{l}
        y+x^2 = $a x, \\
        y +$a x = $b. \\
\end{array}
\]
The solution of the system is:
\{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
$BR
If there is more than one point, type the points separated by a comma (i.e.:  (1,2),(3,4)).
$BR
If the system has no solutions, type $BITALIC none $EITALIC in the answer blank.
