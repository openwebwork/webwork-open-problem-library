If $a -letter ``words'' are formed using the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
how many such words are possible for each of the following conditions:
$BR
(a) No condition is imposed.
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
(b) No letter can be repeated in a word.
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
(c) Each word must begin with the letter A and letters can be repeated.
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
(d) The letter C must be at the end and letters can be repeated.
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
(e) The second letter must be a vowel and letters can be repeated.
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR

(a)  With no restrictions, there are 7 possible letters for each of 
the $a positions in the word, so there are a total of \(7^{$a} = $ans1\) 
possible words.
$PAR
(b) If no letters can be repeated, then there are 7 possibilities for 
the first letter, 6 possibilities for the second letter, etc.  So there 
are a total of \( \frac{7!}{$diff !} = $prod2 = $ans2\) possible words.  
$PAR
(c) The first letter must be A, but there are 7 possible letters for each 
of the $asub1 other positions in the word so there are a total of 
\(7^{$asub1}=$ans3\) possible words. 
$PAR
(d) This is just like part (c).  The last letter must be C, but there are 
7 possible letters for each of the $asub1 other positions in the word so 
there are a total of \(7^{$asub1}=$ans4\) possible words. 
$PAR
(e) Since there are two vowels among the possible letters (A and E), there 
are two choices for the second letter in the word.   There are 7 possible 
letters for each of the other $asub1 positions in the word.  So there are 
a total of \(2\cdot 7^{$asub1}=$ans5\) possible words.
