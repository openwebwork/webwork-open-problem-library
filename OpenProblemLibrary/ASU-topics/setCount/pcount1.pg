$PAR

a)  There are 2 possibilities for each of the $n flips, so there are a 
total of \(2^{$n} = $ans1 \) different possible outcomes.
$PAR
b) Outcomes with exactly $a heads can be completely described by 
indicating which $a of the $n tosses land on heads (since the others 
must be tails).  Therefore there are 
\( {$n \choose $a } = \frac{$n !}{$a ! $diff !} = $ans2 \) possible 
outcomes with exactly $a heads.
$PAR
c) First we count the outcomes that do not have at least 2 heads, i.e. 
the ones that have either 0 or 1 head.  There is only one outcome with 
no heads (the outcome consisting of $n tails) and there are 
\( {$n \choose 1} =$n\) outcomes with exactly 1 head.  As we found in 
part a), there are a total of \(2^{$n}\) possible outcomes overall,  
so the number of outcomes with at least 2 heads is 
\(2^{$n} - ($n +1) = $ans3 \).
$PAR
d) As in part c), we first count the outcomes that do not satisfy the 
given condition, i.e. the ones that have more than $c heads.  There is 
one outcome with exactly $n heads.  There are  \( {$n \choose  $nsub1} \)
outcomes with exactly $nsub1 heads, \( {$n \choose  $nsub2} \) outcomes 
with exactly $nsub2 heads, and \( {$n \choose  $nsub3} \)  outcomes with 
exactly $nsub3 heads.  So there are 
\( 2^{$n} -( 1+   {$n \choose  $nsub1}  + {$n \choose  $nsub2} + {$n \choose  $nsub3}) = $ans4\) 
outcomes with at most $c heads.
