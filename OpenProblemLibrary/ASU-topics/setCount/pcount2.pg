BEGIN_TEXT
A boy has $r red , $y yellow and $g green marbles. In how many ways
can the boy arrange the marbles in a line if:
$BR
a) $SPACE Marbles of the same color are indistinguishable?
$BR
 \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
b)$SPACE  All marbles have different sizes? $BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp($ans1));
ANS(num_cmp($ans2));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

a) If marbles of the same color are indistinguishable, then the total
number of different arrangements is the multinomial coefficient
\[ {$t \choose $r, $y, $g}  = \frac{$t !}{$r ! $y ! $g !} = $ans1 .\]
$PAR
b)  If all the marbles have different sizes, then the marbles are all
distinguishable.  Hence the total number of different arrangements is
the number of permutations of the $t marbles which is \($t ! = $ans2\).
