$n2 = random(3,6,1);
$ans3 = 26**$n2-25**$n2;

BEGIN_TEXT
How many strings of $n2 lower case English letters are there that
have 
the letter x in them somewhere? Here strings may use the same letter more
than once. 
(Hint: It might be easier to first count the strings that don't have an 
x in them.) $BR
Your answer is: \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
END_TEXT
