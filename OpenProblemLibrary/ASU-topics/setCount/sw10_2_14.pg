BEGIN_TEXT
A pianist plans to play $a different pieces at a recital. In how many ways can she
arrange these pieces in the program?
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
END_TEXT

$ans = fact($a);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

An arrangement is a permutation of the $a pieces, so there are a total
of \($a! = $ans \) possible arrangements of the pieces.
