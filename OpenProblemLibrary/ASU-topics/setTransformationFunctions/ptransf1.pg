BEGIN_TEXT
Describe a function \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \) if the graph of
\( g\) is obtained by reflecting the graph of \( f\) about the x-axis and
if it is horizontally stretched by a factor of $a when compared to the graph
of \( f\).
$BR
\( g(x) = A f(B x) + C  \) where
$BR
 \(A =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
\(B =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
\(C =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
