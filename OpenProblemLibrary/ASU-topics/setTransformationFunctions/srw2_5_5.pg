BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = - $a f(x) \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = f(x) \)
by one of the following actions:
$BR
$BR

(a) horizontally stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR

(b) horizontally shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR

(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR

(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
$BR

Your answer is \{pop_up_list('?'=>'?',
'a'=>'a','b'=>'b','c'=>'c','d'=>'d') \}

(e) reflecting the resulting graph in \(x\)-axis;

(f) reflecting the resulting graph in \(y\)-axis;
