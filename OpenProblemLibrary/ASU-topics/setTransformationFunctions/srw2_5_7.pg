The graph of the function 
\( y = f(x-$a)+$b \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = f(x) \)
by one of the following actions:
$BR
$BR
(a) shifting the graph of \(f(x)\) to the right $a units;
$BR

(b) shifting the graph of \(f(x)\) to the left $a units;
$BR

(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR

(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;
$BR
$BR

Your answer is
\{pop_up_list('?'=>'?','a'=>'a','b'=>'b','c'=>'c','d'=>'d') \}
$BR
$BR

Then, followed by one of the following actions:

$BR
$BR
(e) shifting the resulting graph upward $b units;
$BR

(f) shifting the resulting graph downward $b units;
$BR

(g) horizontally stretching the resulting graph by a factor $b;
$BR

(h) horizontally shrinking the resulting graph by a factor 1/$b;
$BR
$BR

Your answer is
\{pop_up_list('?'=>'?','e'=>'e','f'=>'f','g'=>'g','h'=>'h') \}
