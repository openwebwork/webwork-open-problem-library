Solve the given equation in the interval [0,2 \(\pi\)]. 
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD The answer must
be written as a multiple of \(\pi\).
Give exact answers. Do not use decimal numbers. The answer must be an integer
or a fraction. Note that \(\pi\) is already provided with the answer so
you just have to find the appropriate multiple. E.g. if the answer is 
\( \frac{\pi}{2}\) you should enter 1/2. If there is more than one answer write
them separated by commas.
