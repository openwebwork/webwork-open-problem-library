Consider the function \[ f(x)= \frac{($f1) }{($f2) ($f3)} .\]
Enter the equations of the vertical asymptotes.  If there are no
vertical asymptotes, enter $BITALIC none$EITALIC.
If there is more than one vertical asymptote, enter a list
of the equations separated by a comma (e.g., x=20, x=-7).

Vertical asymptotes: \{ ans_rule(40)\}

Enter the equations of the horizontal asymptotes.  If there are no
horizontal asymptotes, enter $BITALIC none$EITALIC.
If there is more than one horizontal asymptote, enter a list
of the equations separated by a comma (e.g., y=20, y=-7).
