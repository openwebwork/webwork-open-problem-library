# Now we do the randomization of variables, and other computations
# as needed for this problem.  Sometimes we compute the answers here.

BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function \[ f(x)=\sqrt{\frac{x-$a}{ x-$b}}\]

	$PAR
a) Determine the domain of the function. 
$BR $BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Write the answer in interval notation. 
If the answer involves more
than one interval write the intervals separated by the union symbol, U. 
If needed enter \( \infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \( -\infty \) as 
- $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC. 
$BR
Domain= \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Find the vertical asymptote(s). If there is more than one vertical asymptote give 
a list of the \( x \)-values 
separated by commas. If there are no vertical asymptotes type in 
$BITALIC None $EITALIC.
$PAR
  \(x =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

If this function has a horizontal asymptote, give its \(y\)-value.
If there is no horizontal asymptote, type in $BITALIC none $EITALIC.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
