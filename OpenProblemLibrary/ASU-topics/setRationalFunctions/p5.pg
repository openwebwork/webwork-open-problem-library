BEGIN_TEXT
In Teaneck, the fruit fly population ${BBOLD}in millions$EBOLD is modeled by
\[ f(t) = \frac{$a t + $b}{t + 1} . \] where \( t \) is in months after June 1st, 2002.

Graph this function on your calculator.
	$PAR
Estimate the inital population of fruit flys on June 1st, 2002.  
$PAR
 Initial population is \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Estimate the population after many months - for example many years into the future.  

$PAR
 Population well into the future is \{ans_rule(40)\}
