BEGIN_TEXT
A once thriving company in Teaneck had its monthly profits, in thousands of 
dollars, modeled by the equation
\[ f(t) = \frac{t^2 + $a}{$b t^2 + $c} . \] where \( t \) is in months 
after June 1st, 2002.

Graph this function on your calculator.
	$PAR
Estimate the company's profits on June 1st, 2002.  
$PAR
 Profits on June 1st, 2002: $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
Estimate the company's profits many years into the future.  

$PAR
 Profits many years into the future: $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(40)\}
