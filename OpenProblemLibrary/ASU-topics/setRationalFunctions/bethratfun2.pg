What are the vertical asymptotes?  Give a list of the \(x\)-values of the
asymptotes separated by commas.

$BR
What is the horizontal asymptote?

$BR
What are the \( x \) -intercepts?  Give a list of the 
\( x \) -intercepts separated by commas (i.e.:  (1,2),(3,4)).  
If there are no \(x\)-intercepts, type in $BITALIC none $EITALIC.
