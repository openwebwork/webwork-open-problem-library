For the function \[ f(x)= \frac{$a x }{($b x+$c) ($d x+$e)} ,\]
$BR
what are the vertical asymptotes?  Give a list of the \(x\)-values of the
asymptotes separated by commas.

What is the horizontal asymptote?

What are the \( x \) -intercepts?  Give a list of the \(x\)-values of the
\( x \) intercepts separated by commas.
