For the function \[ f(x)= \frac{$a x }{($b x+$c) ($d x+$e)} ,\]
$BR
what are the vertical asymptotes?  Give a list of the \(x\)-values of the
asymptotes separated by commas.
	$PAR
	\(x =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
What is the horizontal asymptote?
	$PAR
	\(y = \)\{ ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
What are the \( x \) -intercepts?  Give a list of the \(x\)-values of the
\( x \) intercepts separated by commas.

$BR
What is the \( y \) -intercept?
