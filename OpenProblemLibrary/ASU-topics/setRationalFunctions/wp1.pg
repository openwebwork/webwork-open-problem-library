The horizontal asymptote of 0 tells us that in the long run, the
concentration of the drug will go to 0.  At some point, it will drop
below 0.1.  Later, it will drop below 0.01, and then below 0.001, and
so on.
$PAR
It is also true that by the given formula for \(C(t)\),
the concentration is always
positive.  So, it predicts that there will always be some of the drug
remaining in the patient even though that amount will keep decreasing
over time.

BEGIN_TEXT
The concentration of a drug \( t \) seconds after injection is given by
\[ C(t) = \frac{$a t + 1}{$c t^2+$d } . \]

Graph this function on your calculator.
	$PAR
Estimate the time at which the concentration is highest (your answer
needs to be correct to at least one place past the decimal point):
$PAR
 Maximum is at \(t =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR
$HR
$PAR
If this function has a horizontal asymptote, give its \(y\)-value.
If there is no horizontal asymptote, type in  $BITALIC none $EITALIC.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$HR
What does a horizontal asymptote mean in the context of this problem?  An
explanation will be provided when you get the answers above correct.
