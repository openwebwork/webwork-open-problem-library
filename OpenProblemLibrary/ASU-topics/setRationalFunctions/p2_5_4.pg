# Now we do the randomization of variables, and other computations
# as needed for this problem.  Sometimes we compute the answers here.

BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function \[ f(x)=\sqrt{\frac{ x - $a}{ $p }} \]

	$PAR
a) Determine the domain of the function.
$BR $BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Write the answer in interval notation. 
If the answer involves
more than one interval write the intervals separated by the union symbol, U.
If needed enter \( \infty \) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \( -\infty\) as 
- $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC. 
$BR
Domain = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR 
b)
Find the vertical asymptote(s). If there is more than one vertical asymptote give 
a list of the \( x \)-values 
separated by commas. If there are no vertical asymptotes type in 
$BITALIC None $EITALIC.
$PAR
  \(x =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
