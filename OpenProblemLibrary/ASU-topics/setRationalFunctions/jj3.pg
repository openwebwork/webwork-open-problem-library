Graph the rational function
$BR$BR
\[ y = \frac{$a x^2 - $b x}{$c x + $d} \]
$BR$HR$BR
The \(x\)-intercept(s) have
	\(x =\)  \{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR$BR
Give you answer as a comma separated list (e.g., 2,3,8.4).  If there are none,
enter $BITALIC None $EITALIC.
$BR$HR$BR
The \(y\)-intercept(s) have
	\(y =\)  \{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR$BR
Give you answer as a comma separated list (e.g., 2,3,8.4).  If there are none,
enter $BITALIC None $EITALIC.

$BR$HR$BR
The vertical asymptote(s) have
	\(x =\)  \{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR$BR
Give you answer as a comma separated list (e.g., 2,3,8.4).  If there are none,
enter $BITALIC None $EITALIC.

$BR$HR$BR
The horizontal asymptote(s) have
	\(y =\)  \{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR$BR
Give you answer as a comma separated list (e.g., 2,3,8.4).  If there are none,
enter $BITALIC None $EITALIC.

$BR$HR$BR
The local extrema are
	  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR$BR
Give you answer as a comma separated list $BBOLD of ordered pairs $EBOLD
correct to one decimal place (e.g., (1.3, 4.2), (-1.8, 4.6)).  If there are none,
enter $BITALIC None $EITALIC.
