BEGIN_TEXT
The cost in dollars for removing \( p \) percent of pollutants from a river in Smith County is 
\[ C(p) = \frac{$a p}{100 - p} . \] 

Graph this function on your calculator.
$BR$BR
Find the cost of removing 20$PERCENT.  
$BR$BR
 Cost for removing 20$PERCENT, in dollars, is  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR$BR
Find the cost of removing half of the pollutants.
$BR$BR
 Cost for removing half, in dollars, is  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR$BR
Find the cost of removing all but 5$PERCENT of the pollutants.
$BR$BR
Cost for removing all but 5$PERCENT, in dollars, is  \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR$BR
What is the smallest value \( p \) can be?
$BR$BR
The smallest value \( p \) can be is \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR$BR
What is the largest integer value \( p \) can be?
$BR$BR
The largest integer value \( p \) can be is \{ans_rule(40)\}
