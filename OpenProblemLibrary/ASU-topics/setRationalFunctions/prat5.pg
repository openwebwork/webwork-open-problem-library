BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function \[ f(x)=\frac{ x^2 - $c}{ x^2 - $d} \]

	$PAR
Find the vertical asymptote(s). If there is more than one vertical asymptote give a list 
of the \(x \)-values 
separated by commas.
$PAR
  \(x =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
$HR
$PAR
If this function has a horizontal asymptote, give its \(y\)-value.
If there is no horizontal asymptote, type in $BITALIC None $EITALIC.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(40)\}
$HR
Find the \( x \)-intercept(s). 
If there is more than one \( x \)-intercept give a list of the \( x \)-values 
separated by commas.
$PAR
  \(x =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR
Find the \( y \)-intercept
$PAR
  \(y =\) \{ans_rule(40)\}
