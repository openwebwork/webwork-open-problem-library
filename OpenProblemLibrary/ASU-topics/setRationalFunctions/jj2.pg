BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the function \[  f(x)= \frac{$p1}{$p2} \]
$BR
What are the vertical asymptotes?  Give a list of the \( x \)-values of the
asymptotes separated by commas.  If there are none, enter $BITALIC None$EITALIC.
	$BR
	\(x =\) \{ ans_rule(30)\}
$BR 
$BR
What is the horizontal asymptote?  If there are none, enter $BITALIC None$EITALIC.
	$BR
	\(y = \)\{ ans_rule(30)\}
$BR 
$BR
What are the \( x \) -intercepts?  Give a list of the \(x\)-values of the
\( x \) -intercepts separated by commas.  If there are none, enter $BITALIC None$EITALIC.
