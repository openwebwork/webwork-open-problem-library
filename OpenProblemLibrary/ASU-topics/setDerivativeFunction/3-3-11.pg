TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Let \( f(x) = $d ? {$c} x^2\).   If \(h \neq 0\), then the difference quotient
can be simplified as 
\[
    \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = Ah + Bx + C,
\]
where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are
constants.  (Note: It's possible for one or more of these
constants to be 0.)  Find the constants.
$PAR
\(A = \) \{ans_rule(5)\}, 
\(B = \) \{ans_rule(5)\}, and
\(C = \) \{ans_rule(5)\}.
$BR
$BR
Use the simplified expression to find
\(\displaystyle{f'(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) -
f(x)}{h}} = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}

Finally, find each of the following:
$PAR
\(f'(1) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\},
\(f'(2) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}, and
\(f'(3) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}.
