A hospital performs 3 types of operations.  The first type takes 30 minutes,
and they charge $DOLLAR$c for it.  The second type takes 1 hour, and
they charge $DOLLAR$d for it.  The third operation takes 2 hours, and
they charge $DOLLAR$e for it.  The hospital can schedule up to $b total operations per day.  Moreover, they have $ors operating rooms, each of which
can be used for $hrs hours per day.  Determine how many of each type of
operation the hospital would perform to maximize its revenue.
