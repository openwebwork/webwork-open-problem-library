A hardware store will run an advertising campaign using radio and newspaper.
Every dollar spent on radio advertising will reach $b2 people in the ${LQ}Under
$DOLLAR$cut,000${RQ} market, and $b people in the 
${LQ}Over $DOLLAR$cut,000${RQ} market.
Every dollar spent on newspaper advertising will reach $a2 people in the ${LQ}Under
$DOLLAR$cut,000${RQ} market, and $a people in the ${LQ}Over $DOLLAR$cut,000${RQ} market.
If the store wants to reach at least $c,000 people in the ${LQ}Under
$DOLLAR$cut,000${RQ} market and $c2,000 people in the ${LQ}Over $DOLLAR$cut,000${RQ} market, how much should it spend on each type of advertising to minimize the cost?

Minimum amount spent on advertising (in dollars): \{ ans_rule(30) \}
