BEGIN_TEXT
The Cheery Cherry Chair Company makes three types of chairs, the 
${BITALIC}Montegue${EITALIC}, the ${BITALIC}Capulet${EITALIC}, and
the ${BITALIC}Verona${EITALIC}.  Each chair requires assembly, finishing, 
and a certain amount of wood to make.  The assembly area can be used for
at most $a hours per day.  To keep him busy, the finishing person needs to
work at least 6 hours per day.
Producing a ${BITALIC}Montegue${EITALIC} requires 1 hour of assembly, 2 hour
of finishing, and $b3 board feet of wood.
Producing a ${BITALIC}Capulet${EITALIC} requires 1 hour of assembly, 1 hour
of finishing, and $b3 board feet of wood.
Finally, producing a ${BITALIC}Verona${EITALIC} requires 2 hour of assembly, 1 hour
of finishing, and $b board feet of wood.  If the company wants to minimize
the amount of cherry wood used, how many should they make of each model?
(It is possible to complete a fractional part a chair in a given day; in
the long run you end up with completed chairs.)

How many board feet of cherry wood would be used each day?
