BEGIN_TEXT
A company separates $ore1, $ore2, and kryptonite from ore by the
floatation separation process, which has three steps: oiling, mixing,
and separation.  
These steps must be applied for $a, $b, and 1 hour respectively to produce one unit of $ore1;
 $a, $a, and 1 hour respectively to produce one unit of $ore2;
 and 1, 1, $b hours respectively to produce one unit of kryptonite.
Because of limited access to equipment,
the oiling and separation phases can each be in operation for a maximum
of $x hours per week, and the mixing process can be in operation for a
maximum of $xd hours per week.  The company makes a profit of $DOLLAR$m2 per
unit of $ore1, $DOLLAR$m1 per unit of $ore2, and $DOLLAR$m3 per unit of
kryptonite.  Assuming that the demaind for each metal is unlimited, how many units of each metal should the company produce each week
to maximize its profit?

Number of units of $ore1 = \{ans_rule(20)\}

Number of units of $ore2 = \{ans_rule(20)\}

Number of units of kryptonite = \{ans_rule(20)\}
