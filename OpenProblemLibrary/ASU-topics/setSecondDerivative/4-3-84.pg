A company has found that the
relationship between the price \(p\) and the demand \(x\)
for a particular product is given approximately by
\[ p = $a - $b x^2.  \]
The company also knows that the cost of producing the product is
given by \(C(x) = $c + $d x.\)

$BR
Find \(P(x)\), the profit function.
$PAR
\(P(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR
Now use the profit function to do the following:
$BR
$BR
(A) Find the average of the \(x\) values of all local maxima of
\(P\).
$BR
Note: If there are no local maxima, enter -1000.
$PAR
Average of \(x\) values = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
$BR
(B) Find the average of the \(x\) values of all local minima of
\(P\).
$BR
Note: If there are no local minima, enter -1000.
$PAR
Average of \(x\) values = \{ans_rule(20)\}
