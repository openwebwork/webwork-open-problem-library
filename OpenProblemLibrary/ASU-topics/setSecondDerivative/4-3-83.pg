The marketing research department for a computer company used a large city to test market their new product. $BR
They found that the relationship between the price \(p\) and the demand \(x\) was given approximately by
\[ p = $a - $b x^2.  \]
$BR
$BR
Find \(R(x)\), the revenue function.
$PAR
\(R(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR
Now use the revenue function to do the following:
$BR
$BR
(A) Find the average of the \(x\) values of all local maxima of
\(R(x)\).
$BR
Note: If there are no local maxima, enter -1000.
$PAR
Average of \(x\) values = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR
$BR
(B) Find the average of the \(x\) values of all local minima of
\(R(x)\).
$BR
Note: If there are no local minima, enter -1000.
$PAR
Average of \(x\) values = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$PAR

(C) Use interval notation to indicate where \( R(x) \) is concave up.
$PAR
$PAR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Enter 'I' for \(\infty\), '-I' for \(-\infty\), and 'U' for the union symbol. $BR
If you have extra boxes, fill each in with an 'x'. $BR
