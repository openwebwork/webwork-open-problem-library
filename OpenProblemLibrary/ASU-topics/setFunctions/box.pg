BEGIN_TEXT
An open box is to be made from a flat piece of material $a inches long and 
$b inches wide by cutting equal squares of length \(x \)from the corners 
and folding up the sides. 
$PAR
Write the volume \(V \)of the box as a function of \(x \).  Leave it as a product of factors,
do not multiply out the factors.

$PAR
\(V =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
$PAR
If we write the domain of the box as an open interval in the form (a,b),
then what is \(a =\)?    
	$PAR
	\(a =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$PAR
and what is \(b =\)?  
	$PAR
	\(b =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
