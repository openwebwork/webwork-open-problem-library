BEGIN_TEXT
The profit function for a computer company is given by
\( P(x) = -x^2+$b x +$c \)
where \( x \) is the number of units produced (in thousands)
and the profit is in thousand of dollars.

$BR
a) Determine how many (thousands of) units must be produced to yield maximum profit. 
Determine the maximum profit.
	$PAR
	(thousands of) units = \{ans_rule(20)\}
        $PAR
        maximum profit = \{ans_rule(20)\} thousand dollars
$BR
b) Determine how many units should be produced for a profit of at least
40 thousand.
$PAR
more than  \{ans_rule(20)\} (thousands of) units
$PAR
less than   \{ans_rule(20)\} (thousands of) units
