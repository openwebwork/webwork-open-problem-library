BEGIN_TEXT
A ball is thrown upward from the top of a building $h feet tall.
The height of the ball is described by the function
\( h(t) = - 16 t^2 +$b t + $h \), where \( t \) is in seconds and \( t = 0 \)
corresponds to the moment the ball is thrown.
$BR$BR
a) Determine for what value of \( t \) the ball reaches the maximum height and
determine this maximum height.
$BR$BR
	\( t = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
and maximum height = \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR$BR
b) Determine when the ball reaches the ground.
