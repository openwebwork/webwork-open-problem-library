BEGIN_TEXT
Find the number of elements in \( A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \) if there are $a 
elements in \( A_1, \) $b  elements in \( A_2 \), and $c elements in \( A_3 \) in each 
of the following situations:$BR $BR
(a) $SPACE The sets are pairwise disjoint. $BR
\{ ans_rule(40) \} $BR $BR
(b)$SPACE  There are $e elements common to each pair of sets and  $f elements in all three sets. $BR
\{ ans_rule(40) \}

$BR$BR${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD the answers to this problem must evaluate to the
correct answer exactly.
