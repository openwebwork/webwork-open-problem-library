You have $r cards and $n envelopes (labeled 1,2, ..,$n).
$BR
In how many ways can you put the $r cards into the envelopes if

$BR$BR
(a) The cards are distinct? 
  $BR$BR
Answer = \{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR$BR
(b) The cards are identical?  $BR$BR
Answer = \{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR$BR
(b) The cards are identical and no envelope can be left empty?
  $BR$BR
Answer = \{ ans_rule(15) \}
