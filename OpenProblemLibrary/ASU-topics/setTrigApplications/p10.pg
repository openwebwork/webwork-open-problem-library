BEGIN_TEXT
The bearing from city A to city B is S \( $ang1 ^\circ \)E and the bearing
from city B to city C is N \( $ang2 ^\circ \)E. (See picture below where
\( \alpha = $ang1 ^\circ \) and \( \beta = $ang2 ^\circ \). Click on the picture
to see it more clearly).
$PAR

$PAR
It takes $t1 hours for a car traveling at $speed miles per hour to go 
from A to B and $t2 hours to go from B to C.
$BR
Find the distance between city A and city C.

$BR distance = \{ans_rule(20)\}
