#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

In 2005, Bhutan had a population of about [`2200000`] and an annual growth factor of [`1.0211`]. Let [` f(t)`] be the population [` t `] years after 2005 assuming growth continues at this rate.
  
a) Write a formula for [`f(t)`].

    [` P(t) = `][_]{$f}

b) According to your formula, what will the population of Bhutan be in [` [$y] `]? [_]{$p}


END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) Since there is an annual growth factor, this assumes that the population model is exponential with form:
[``` P(t) = [$a] ([$b])^t ```]

b) Using this model, we substitute [`t=[$r]`], the number of years since 2005.  The result is [`[$p]`]
