#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML
Suppose this is a word problem that asks students to set up a differential equation and enter their differential equation
as the answer.

Enter your differential equation below in terms of [` y, y^{\,\prime}, y^{\,\prime\prime}, t `].  (Suppose the answer is the differential equation [` [$diffeq] `].)
