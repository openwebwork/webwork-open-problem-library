BEGIN_PGML
The purpose of this question is to show you the syntax needed to enter 
matrices in WeBWorK when there is only one answer box for entering a matrix 
(which is not obvious) or when there are multiple answer boxes for entering a matrix (which is obvious).
The examples below should be self-explanatory, so you can jump to them if you want;
however, a detailed explanation follows if you want to read more.

Matrices use square brackets to enclose items in lists.  
A matrix with one row, such as a row vector, is a comma separated list enclosed by square brackets.
A matrix with more than one row or a column vector is a comma separated list of lists, where each list 
uses square brackets to enclose its items.
Your answers must use square brackets to enclose each row in a matrix or in a
column vector.  Also, a pair of square brackets is needed to enclose
a matrix with more than one row (e.g., a [` 2 \times 3 `] matrix
and a [` 2 \times 1 `] column vector have multiple rows so they need extra 
square brackets, but a [` 1 \times 3 `] row vector has only one row so it does
not need extra square brackets).  Your answers may have spaces and line breaks in them, 
such as 

>> [|  [ [1, 2, 3], |] <<  
>> [| [4, 5, 6] ]  |] <<

+ Enter the matrix [`` [$example1] ``] as [@ $example1->string @]*  
[@ ans_box(3,30) @]*

+ Enter the column vector [`` [$example2] ``] as [@ $example2->string @]*  
[@ ans_box(3,30) @]*

+ Enter the row vector [`` [$example3] ``] as [@ $example3->string @]*  
[@ ans_box(3,30) @]*
END_PGML

$showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1;

ANS( $example1->cmp() );
ANS( $example2->cmp() );
ANS( $example3->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML
[$BR]*
+ Entering a matrix using multiple answer blanks is straightforward -- 
just put each matrix entry into its own answer blank.
Enter the matrix [`` [$example4] ``] with one matrix entry per answer box.  
[______]*{$example4}
