BEGIN_PGML

A student was asked to find an equation for the plane that is tangent
plane to the surface 

    [`` z = [$f] ``] 

at the point [`` (x,y) = ([$a],[$b]) ``].  The student's answer was

    [`` z = [$studentplane]``]. 

a) At a glance, how do you know this is wrong?  What mistakes did the student make?  Select all that apply.
    [__]{$cmc}{cmp_options => {weight => 5}}
b) Find a correct equation for the tangent plane.   
    [`` z = ``][_]{$tangentplane}{cmp_options =>{ weight => 95, width => 40}}
