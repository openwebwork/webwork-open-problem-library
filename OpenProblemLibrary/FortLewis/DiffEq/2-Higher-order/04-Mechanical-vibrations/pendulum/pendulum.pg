"Suppose a pendulum of length \(L\) meters 
makes an angle of \(\theta\) radians with the 
vertical, as in the figure.  It can be shown that  
as a function of time, \(\theta\) satisfies the 
differential equation

\[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L} \sin\theta = 0,
\]

where \(g = 9.8 \ \mathrm{m/s^2} \) is the acceleration 
due to gravity.  For \(\theta\) near zero we can 
use the linear approximation \(\sin(\theta) \approx \theta\) 
to get a linear differential equation

\[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L} \theta = 0.
\]

Use the linear differential equation to answer the 
following questions.
