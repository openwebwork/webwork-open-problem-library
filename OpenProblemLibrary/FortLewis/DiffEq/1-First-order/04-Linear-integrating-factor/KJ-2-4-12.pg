BEGIN_TEXT
Assume that two colonies each have \( $P0 \) 
members at time \( t = 0 \) and that each 
evolves with a constant relative birth rate
\( k = r_{b} - r_{d} \).  For colony 1, 
assume that individuals migrate into the 
colony at a rate of \( $M \) individuals 
per unit time.  Assume that this immigration 
occurs for \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \) and ceases
thereafter.  For colony 2, assume that a 
similar migration pattern occurs but is 
delayed by one unit of time; that is, 
individuals immigrate at a rate of \( $M \)
individuals per unit time, \( 1 \leq t \leq 2 \).
Suppose we are interested in comparing the
evolution of these two populations over the 
time interval \( 0 \leq t \leq 2 \).  The
initial value problems governing the two 
populations are
$PAR

\begin{array}{lllll}

\frac{dP_1}{dt} = k P_1 + M_1(t), &&
P_1(0) = $P0, &&
M_1(t) =

$M, && 0 \leq t \leq 1, \\

\end{array}
\right.

$ITEMSEP
$ITEM
Suppose that there is a fixed number of 
individuals that can be introduced into a 
population at any time through migration
and that the objective is to maximize the
population at some fixed future time.  Do
the calculations performed in this problem
suggest a strategy (based on the relative
birth rate) for accomplishing this?
