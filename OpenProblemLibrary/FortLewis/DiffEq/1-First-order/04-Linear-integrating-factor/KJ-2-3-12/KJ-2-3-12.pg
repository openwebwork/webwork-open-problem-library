"Consider the mixing process shown in the 
figure.
A mixing chamber initially contains $v liters 
of a clear liquid.  Clear liquid flows into 
the chamber at a rate of 10 liters per
minute.  A dye solution having a concentration
of ${dye_in} kilograms per liter is 
injected into the mixing chamber at a constant rate 
of \( r \) liters per minute.  When the mixing
process is started, the well-stirred mixture
is pumped from the chamber at a rate of 
\( 10 + r \) liters per minute.
