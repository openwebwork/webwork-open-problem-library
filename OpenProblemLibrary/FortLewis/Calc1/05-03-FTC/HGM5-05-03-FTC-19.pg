SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
 
The time period 9AM to 5PM is represented by the time \(t=0\)
to \(t=8\) and \(t=24\) to \(t=32\).  The area under the curve, or total
number of worker-hours for these times, is about $dayboxes boxes or
\($dayboxes(80) = $daywh\) worker-hours.  The total cost for 9AM to 5PM is
therefore \(($daywh)($pay)=$regular\) dollars.   The area under the rest of
the curve is about $nightboxes boxes, or \($nightboxes(80)=$nightwh\)
worker-hours.  The total cost for this time period is
\(($nightwh)($overtime) = $extra\) dollars.  The total cost is about
\($regular + $extra = $totalcost\) dollars.

$PAR
Another estimate would be to approximate the curved sections of the graph
with straight lines; this gives the estimate $est dollars.
