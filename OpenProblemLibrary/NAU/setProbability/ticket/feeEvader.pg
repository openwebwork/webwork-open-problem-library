Hungarian tram and bus tickets have 9 possible locations for holes.
$BR

$BR
Passengers need to validate their tickets on their own using a punching machine that creates holes on the ticket.
Transportation officials randomly travel around town and ask for the passengers' validated tickets.
The tickets do not expire.  
In theory, the ticket needs to be inserted into the punching machine with the red arrow on top. In practice, 
this does not matter since the officials do not care about the direction. So, inserting the ticket with the red
arrow on the bottom creates the same ticket. A fee evader wants to collect every possible validated
ticket and use the appropriate one every time he/she travels. How many different validated tickets
are needed if every punching machine in town creates $k holes on a ticket?
$PAR
The fee evader needs to collect \{ ans_rule(35) \} tickets.
