BEGIN_TEXT

To determine whether or not they have a certain desease, $grp people are to have their blood tested. However, rather than testing each
individual separately, it has been decided first to group the people in groups of $sgrp. The blood samples of the $sgrp people in each group will be
pooled and analyzed together. If the test is negative, one test will suffice for the $sgrp people (we are assuming that the pooled test will be
positive if and only if at least one person in the pool has the desease); whereas, if the test is positive each of the
$sgrp people will also be individually tested and, in all, $sgrp1 tests will be made on this group. Assume the probability that a person has the
desease is $p for all people, independently of each other, and compute the expected number of tests necessary for the entire group of $grp people. $BR

answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}
