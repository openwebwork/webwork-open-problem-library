BEGIN_TEXT
Real estate ads suggest that $garfrac $PERCENT of homes for sale have garages,
$BR
$plfrac $PERCENT have swimming pools, and 
$BR
$both $PERCENT have both features.
$BR
What is the probability that a home for sale has
$BR
a) a pool or a garage? 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT
$BR
b) neither a pool nor a garage? 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT
$BR
c) a pool but no garage? 
$BR
Answer = \{ans_rule(10)\}$PERCENT
