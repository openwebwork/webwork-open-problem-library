BEGIN_TEXT
Factories A, B and C produce computers. Factory A produces $n1 times as many computers
as factory C, and factory B produces $n2 times as many computers
as factory C. The probability that a computer produced by factory A is defective is
$pda, the probability that a computer produced by factory B is defective is $pdb, and the 
probability that a computer produced by factory C is defective is $pdc.

$BR
A computer is selected at random and it is found to be defective. What is the 
probability it came from factory $refac?
$BR
Answer:\{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
