You ask a neighbor to water a sickly plant while you are on vacation.
Without water the plant will die with probability $pd. With water it will die
with probability $pdw. You are $ww $PERCENT certain the neighbor will remember
to water the plant.
$BR
When you are on vacation, find the probability that the plant will die.
