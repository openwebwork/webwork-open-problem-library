BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the experiment where a fair coin is tossed.  
$BR
If the toss results in a head, then 1 die is thrown.  
$BR
If the toss results in a tail, then 2 dice are thrown.  
$BR
Let $BBOLD X $EBOLD denote the random variable that 
$BR
counts the number of spots showing on the thrown die or dice.  
$BR
The range of values that $BBOLD X $EBOLD can assume are the 
$BR
positive integers from 1 to 12 inclusive.
$BR 
Please give the corresponding probabilities for the values of $BBOLD X $EBOLD given below.
$BR
Pr(X = 1) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 2) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 3) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 4) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 5) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 6) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 7) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 8) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 9) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 10) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 11) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 12) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$PAR
Further, find the probability that $BBOLD X $EBOLD is divisible by $remult.
$BR
Probability that $BBOLD X $EBOLD is divisible by $remult equals \{ans_rule(10)\}
