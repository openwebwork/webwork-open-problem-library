BEGIN_TEXT
A $DOLLAR $val oil detector is lowered under the sea to detect oil fields,
$BR
and it becomes detached from the ship.  If the instrument is not found within
$BR
36 hours, it will crack under the pressure of the sea.  It is assumed that a
$BR
SCUBA diver will find it with probability $nup, but it costs $DOLLAR $dcost to 
$BR
hire each diver.  
$BR
$BR
a)How many SCUBA divers should be hired in order to maximize the expected gain?
$BR

answer: (round to nearest integer) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
b)Using your answer to part a), what is the expected gain?
$BR
answer: $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(10)\}
