BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the experiment where a pair of fair dice is thrown.
$PAR
Let \(X\) denote the random variable whose
value is determined by taking the maximum of the spots showing on
either of the two dice thrown.
For example, if a 3 and a 5 were thrown, then \(X\) would
take the value of \(\mbox{max}(3,5) = 5\).
Note that the range of values that \(X\) can assume are the
positive integers \(\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6\rbrace\).
$PAR
Find each of the probabilities below (note that this specifies
the PDF for \(X\)).
$PAR
\(Pr(X = 1) = \)\{ $ans1->ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(Pr(X = 2) = \)\{ $ans2->ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(Pr(X = 3) = \)\{ $ans3->ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(Pr(X = 4) = \)\{ $ans4->ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(Pr(X = 5) = \)\{ $ans5->ans_rule(10)\} $BR
\(Pr(X = 6) = \)\{ $ans6->ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
Further, find the probability that \(X\) is divisible by \($remult\):
$BR
\(Pr(X \mbox{ is divisible by } $remult) = \) \{$ans7->ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
We can find each of the indicated probabilities by determining the
number of outcomes in the sample space that give the corresponding
value of \(X = \mbox{max}(\mbox{die 1},\mbox{die 2})\).
$PAR
\(Pr(X = 1) = \frac{1}{36}\), because the only way for this to occur
is for the dice both to come up \(1\).
$BR
\(Pr(X = 2) = \frac{3}{36}\), because this may occur with the rolls
\((1,2)\), \((2,1)\), or \((2,2)\).  Similarly, we find$BR
\(Pr(X = 3) = \frac{5}{36}\), $BR
\(Pr(X = 4) = \frac{7}{36}\), $BR
\(Pr(X = 5) = \frac{9}{36}\), and $BR
\(Pr(X = 6) = \frac{11}{36}\).

$PAR
Finally, if \(X\) is divisible by \($remult\), we know that the maximum
value on the two dice must be $divis[$ind].  The corresponding
probability is therefore $BR
\(Pr(X \mbox{ is divisible by } $remult) = \frac{$divnum[$ind]}{36} $divsimp[$ind] \).
