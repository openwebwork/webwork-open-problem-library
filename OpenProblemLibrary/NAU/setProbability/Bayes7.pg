BEGIN_TEXT

Scientific research on popular beverages consisted of  
$di studies that were fully sponsored by the food industry, and $dni studies 
that were conducted with no corporate ties. Of those that were fully 
sponsored by the food industry, $du $PERCENT of the participants found 
the products unfavorable, $dn $PERCENT were neutral, and $df $PERCENT 
found the products favorable. Of those that had no industry funding, 
$dnu $PERCENT found the products unfavorable, $dnn $PERCENT were neutral, and $dnf $PERCENT 
found the products favorable.
$BR
What is the probability that a participant selected at random found the 
products favorable?
$BR

\{ ans_rule(10) \}
