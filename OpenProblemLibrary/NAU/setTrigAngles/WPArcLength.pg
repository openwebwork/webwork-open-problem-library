BEGIN_TEXT
Paul Ernster kicked many filed goals during his time on the NAU football team.  
Assume that the distance between the goal posts, 18.5 ft, is the length of an arc 
on a circle of radius $a yards (the length of the fild goal to be kicked).  
Ernster aims to kick the ball midway between the uprights.  To score a field goal, 
what is the maximum number of degrees that the actual trajectory can deviate from the intended trajectory?
$BR
 \{ans_rule(10) \} degrees.
