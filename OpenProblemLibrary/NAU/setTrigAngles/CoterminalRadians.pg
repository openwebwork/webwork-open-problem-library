BEGIN_TEXT

The positive angle between 0 and \( 2\pi \) in radians that is coterminal with
the angle \(\frac{$c}{$b}\pi \) in radians is \{ans_rule(15) \}.  (You can enter \(\pi\) as
'pi' in your answer.)
$BR

The negative angle between \( -2\pi \) and 0 in radians that is coterminal with
the angle \(\frac{$c}{$b}\pi \) in radians is \{ans_rule(15) \}.  (You can enter \(\pi\) as
'pi' in your answer.)
