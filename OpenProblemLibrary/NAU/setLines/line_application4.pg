BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose that in the year 2000, the cost of a compact car averaged $ $c1
and that in 2003, the cost averaged $ $c2. Assuming that the relationship
between year \(t\) and cost \(c\) is linear, develop a formula for
predicting the average cost of a compact car in the future measuring the variable \(t\) as years since $y1.  
Be sure to use the lower case variables \(t\) and \(c\).   \{ans_rule(25)\}. 
$PAR
What do you predict the average cost of a compact car will be in 
the year $y3? \{ans_rule(10)\}.
