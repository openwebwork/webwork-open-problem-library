TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A chair manufacturer finds that it costs $y1 dollars 
to manufacture $x1 chairs and $y2 dollars to manufacture $x2 chairs in one day, 
including all costs associated with the factory and the manufacturing process. 
Express the cost \( C(x) \) to manufacture \(x\) chairs assuming that it is a 
linear function: 
\(C(x) = \) \{ans_rule(20) \}
$BR

What are the fixed daily costs associated with the manufacuring process, 
even if no chairs are made? \{ans_rule(20) \}

How much does it cost to make each chair, aside from the fixed costs?   
\{ans_rule(20) \}
