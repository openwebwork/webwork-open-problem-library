$m = random(22.5,57.5,5);
$b = random(1250,2500,25);
$x1 = random(250,280,5);
$x2 = random(520,550,5);

$y1= $m*$x1+$b;
$y2= $m*$x2+$b;

$linear_model = Formula("$m*x+$b");

BEGIN_PGML
A chair manufacturer finds that it costs [$y1] dollars
to manufacture [$x1] chairs and [$y2] dollars to manufacture [$x2] chairs in one day,
including all costs associated with the factory and the manufacturing process.

a) Express the cost [` C(x) `] to manufacture [`x`] chairs assuming that it is a
linear function:

    [`C(x) = `] [_]{$linear_model}

b) What are the fixed daily costs associated with the manufacuring process,
even if no chairs are made? [_]{Real($b)}

c) How much does it cost to make each chair, aside from the fixed costs? [_]{Real($m)}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Since this is a linear model, we will use
[``` C(x) = mx + b ```]
and the information in the problem leads to two points: [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`].  With these the slope of the line through these points is:
[``` m = \frac{y_2-y-1}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{[$y2]-[$y1]}{[$x2]-[$x1]} = [$m] ```]

Then we substitute this and  the first point into the model to get:
[``` [$y2] = [$m] \cdot [$x2] + b ```]
and solve for [`b`] to get [`b = [$b]`]

a) This means that the model is:

    [``` C(x) = [$m] x + [$b] ```]

b) The fixed daily costs is the [`y`]-intercept or $[$b].

c) The cost per chair will be the slope or $[$m].
