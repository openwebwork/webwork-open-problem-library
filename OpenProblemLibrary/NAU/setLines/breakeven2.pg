BEGIN_TEXT
Max Well, a junior college student, lost his scholarship after receiving a D in 
his "Introductory Electromagnetics" course. He decided to buy a fiddle and make some money 
as a street musician. 
His fine instrument cost him $DOLLAR$fstr. Max is a very passionate player and on average he breaks 1 string each hour.  
He can buy strings for $DOLLAR$cstr each. 
$BR 
Find the cost function \(C(x)\) associated with Max 
playing the fiddle for \(x\) hours.
$BR
\(C(x)=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
If on average he makes $DOLLAR$rstr per hour write the revenue function \(R(x)\) 
for the amount of revenue gained from \(x\) hours of playing. 
$BR
\(R(x)=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
Find the profit function \(P(x)\) for the amount of profit gained from \(x\) hours of 
playing.
$BR
\(P(x)=\)\{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
How many hours will Max need to work to break even?
\{ ans_rule(10) \} hours
