The count in a bateria culture is $P1 after $t1 minutes and $P2 after $t2 minutes.
Assuming the bacteria count grows exponentially,
we can conclude that the population grows by a factor of \{ans_rule(10)\}
every $h minutes, and the population of
bacteria after \(t\) minutes is \(P = \) \{ans_rule(30) \}.
$PAR
$BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD
You may write the population in the form \(P = P_0 \, a^{(t-t_0)/h}\).
