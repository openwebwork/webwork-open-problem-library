BEGIN_PGML

A town in the midwest has been experiencing a steady population decline of [$p]% per year for the past decade. If there were [$p0] residents in the year [$t0] and the trend continues, what will the population be in the year [$year]? [_]{$pop}

*Round your answer to the nearest person. Do not use commas to separate thousands in the number.*

$q     = 1 - $p / 100;
$tdiff = $year - $t0;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The population of this town is exponential and the model is 
[``` P(t) = P_0 (1+p/100)^t ```]
where [`p=-[$p/100]`] is the rate of decline as a fraction, [`P_0 = [$p0] `] and [`t`] is the number of years since [$t0]. Thus the model is
[``` P(t) = [$p0] ([$q])^t ```]
To find the population in [$year], use [`t=[$year]-[$t0]= [$tdiff]`], resulting in [`P([$tdiff]) = [$pop]`]
