A particular pain relieving medicine has a decay rate of $p $PERCENT per hour. A patient was given a dose 
of the medicine $hr hours ago and there is currently $amt milligrams of the medicine in the patients bloodstream.

\{ans_rule(30)\} milligrams

$PAR
How long will the patient need to wait for there to be less than 25 $PERCENT of the original dose of the medicine left 
in their bloodstream? $BITALIC Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth of an hour. $EITALIC $BR
\{ans_rule(30)\} hours
