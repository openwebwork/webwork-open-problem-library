If our event requires that the tosses start or end (or both) with a
$face1,  our flips are \( $fs \cdots $fs2 \), \( $fs2 \cdots $fs \),
or \( $fs \cdots $fs \).  Next, if we have exactly two flips that land
${face2}, for each of the first two sets of flips there are \($a - 2 = $am2\)
spaces for the second $face2, and so \($am2\) elements in total.
For the last, we have already specified the locations of both of the
${face2}, so there is one more element here.  Thus the total number
of elements in the event is \( $am2 + $am2 + 1 = $ansc \).

If our event requires that the flips start or end with a pair (but not
both) and have a total of two $face2, we must have
\( $fs2 $fs2 \cdots $fs2 $fs \), \( $fs2 $fs2 \cdots $fs $fs2 \),
\( $fs $fs2 \cdots $fs2 $fs2 \), or \( $fs2 $fs \cdots $fs2 $fs2 \).
(Note that we cannot start or end with a pair of $face2, because of
the stipulation that we do not both start and end with a pair.)
In each case we have \($a - 4 = $am4\) spaces to put one remaining $face1;
thus there are a total of \(4($am4) = $ansc\) elements in the sample space
with this description.

    $solc =<<EOSC;
If our event requires that the flips start and end with different
faces, we must have \($fs\cdots $fs2\) or \($fs2\cdots $fs\).  In
either case, for there to be a total of two $face2 we must put one
remaining \($fs\) in \($a - 2 = $am2\) spaces.  Thus there are a
total of \(2($am2) = $ansc\) elements in the sample space with this
description.

This set will be \( $fs\cdots $fs \), with one of the intervening flips
being a $face1.  There are clearly \($a - 2 = $am2\) elements in the
sample space described this way.

If there is an adjacent triple of $face2, we have two options:
\($fs $fs $fs $fs2\cdots $fs2\), or \( $fs2 \cdots $fs2 $fs $fs $fs \).
If we have only an adjacent pair, there are more elements:
\($fs $fs $fs2 \cdots \), with one of the remaining \($a - 3 = $am3\)
slots filled with a \($fs\); or
\($fs $fs2 \cdots \), with the pair \($fs $fs\) filled in the remaining
\($am3\) slots; or
\($fs2\cdots $fs2 $fs $fs\), with a \($fs\) filled in one of the
remaining \($a - 4 = $am4\) slots; or
\($fs2\cdots $fs2 $fs\), with a pair of \($fs\) filled in one of the
remaining \($am4\) slots.  Thus there are total of
\( 2 + $am3 + $am3 + $am4 + $am4 = $ansd \) elements in this event.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)
The only way to have no ${face2} is if all of the coin tosses
show up $face2c.  There there is only one way for this to happen:
if we throw $a $face2c.  Thus there is \(1\) element in the sample
space with this outcome.
$PAR
(b)
We can get a single $face1 if we throw it first, or second, and so
on.  So there are \($a\) ways that we can get this outcome.
