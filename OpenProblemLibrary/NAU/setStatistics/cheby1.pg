BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that the blood pressure of the human inhabitants of a certain Pacific island is  distributed with 
mean, \(\mu\) = $mu mmHg and standard deviation , \(\sigma \) = $sig mmHg. According to Chebyshev's Theorem, 
at least what percentage of the islander's have blood pressure in the range from $lo mmHg to $hi mmHg ?
$PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\}$PERCENT
