BEGIN_TEXT

In an experiment, a ball is drawn from an urn containing $a $color1 balls and $b $color2 balls.
If the ball is $color1, $coin1  coins are tossed.  Otherwise $coin2 coins are tossed.


$BR
How many elements of the sample space will have a $color1 ball?
\{ $ansa->ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
How many elements of the sample space are there altogether?
\{ $ansb->ans_rule(20) \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

There are $a $color1 balls, so we have \($a\) ways to pick that color
ball.  Then, having picked that ball, we flip $c1 coins; each of those
may land heads or tails, so there are two outcomes per flip, or
\(2^{$c1}\) total outcomes.  Then, by the basic principle of counting,
the total number of outcomes in this event is \($a\cdot 2^{$c1} = $ansa\)
outcomes.
$PAR
Reasoning as before, there are \($ansa\) events associated with drawing
a $color1 ball first, and \($b\cdot 2^{$c2} = $e2\) events associated with
drawing a $color2 ball.  Thus there are \($ansa + $e2 = $ansb\) total
elements in the sample space.
