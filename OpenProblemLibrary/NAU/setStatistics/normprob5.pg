BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose the heights of men are normally distributed with mean, \(\mu\) = $mu inches, and standard deviation , \(\sigma \) = $sig inches. Suppose admission to a summer basketball camp requires that a camp participant must be in the top $p $PERCENT of men's heights, what is the minimum height that a camp participant can have in order to meet the camp's height admission requirement?

$PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\}inches
