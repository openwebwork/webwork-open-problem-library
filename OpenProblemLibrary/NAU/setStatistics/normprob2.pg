BEGIN_TEXT

The combined math and verbal scores for 
students taking a national standardized examination for college admission, is
normally distributed with a mean of $mu and a standard deviation of $sig. 
If a college requires a student to be in the top $p $PERCENT of students taking this test, 
what is the minimum score that such a student can obtain and still qualify for admission at
the college?
$BR
answer:(round to the nearest integer)\{ans_rule(10)\}
