A poll was taken of $n NAU students to determine the proportion of students who eat at the union for most meals. 
It was found that $per $PERCENT of those surveyed ate most of their meals at the union. Recall that this sample 
statistic is meant to approximate the population parameter. For a 95% confidence level, what is the margin of 
error for this poll? $BR ( HINT: The margin of error is two times the standard deviation of the sampling distribution)

MOE: \{ans_rule(20)\} $PERCENT $BR
