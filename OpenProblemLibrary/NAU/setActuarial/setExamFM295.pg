TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose the exchange rate is $e $DOLLAR/euro, the euro-denominated continuously compounded interest rate is $ie$PERCENT , the dollar-denominated continuously compounded interest rate is $id$PERCENT , and the price of a 1-year $k-strike European call on the euro is $DOLLAR $c.

 $BR

What is the price of a $k-strike European put $DOLLAR\{ans_rule(20)\}?
