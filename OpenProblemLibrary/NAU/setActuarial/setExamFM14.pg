TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Two perpetuities have the same annual effective interest rate.  Perpetuity A pays $DOLLAR $a at the end of each year for the first 20 years and then $DOLLAR $b at the end of each year thereafter.  Perpetuity B is a perpetuity due which has a level annual payment of $DOLLAR $c.  At time \(t = {0}\), the present value of Perpetuity A is equal to that of Perpetuity B.  What is the effective annual interest rate, \(i\)?
