On January 1, 1998, John deposited $DOLLAR 1000 into Bank X to earn interest at rate i per annum compounded $d.  
On January 1, 2003, he transferred his account to Bank Y to earn interest at rate j per annum compounded $d1.  
On January 1, 2006, the balance at Bank Y is $DOLLAR $b.  
If John could have earned interest at rate j per annum compounded $d1 for the entire eight years, his balance would have been $DOLLAR $b1.  
Calculate the ratio of j to i.
