TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
An off-market forward contract is a forward where either you have to pay a premium or you receive a premium for entering into the contract. (With a standard forward contract, the premium is zero.)  Suppose the effective annual interest rate is $i $PERCENT and the S-R index is 1000.  Consider 1-year forward contracts.
