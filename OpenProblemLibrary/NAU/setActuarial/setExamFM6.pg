At a certain interest rate, the present value of the following two payment patterns are equal:
$BR(i)  $DOLLAR $p1 at the end of five years, plus $DOLLAR $p2 at the end of ten years,
$BR(ii) $DOLLAR $p3 at the end of five years.
$BR At the same interest rate, $DOLLAR 100 invested now, plus $DOLLAR 120 invested at the end of five years will accumulate to P at the end of ten years.  Calculate P.
