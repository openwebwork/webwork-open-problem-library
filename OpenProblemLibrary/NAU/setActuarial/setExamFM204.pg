TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose you desire to short-sell $amt shares of ABC stock, which has a bid price of $DOLLAR $bp and an ask price of $DOLLAR $ap . You cover the short position 180 days later when the bid price is $DOLLAR $bp1 and the ask price is $DOLLAR $ap1.$BR
$BR
a) Taking into account only the bid and ask prices (ignoring commissions and interest), what profit did you make: $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
$BR
b) Suppose that there is a 0.$c $PERCENT commission to engage in the short-sale (this is the commission to sell the stock and a 0.$c $PERCENT commission to close the short-sale (this is the commission to buy the stock back).  Considering these commissions, what profit did you make: $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
$BR
c) Suppose the 6-month interest rate is $c $PERCENT and that you are paid no interest on the short-sale proceeds.  Still assuming that there is a 0.$c $PERCENT commission to engage in the short-sale, how much interest do you lose during the 6 months in which you have the short position: $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
