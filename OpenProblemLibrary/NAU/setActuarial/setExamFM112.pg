TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Janet receives a $DOLLAR 10,000 life insurance benefit.  If she uses the proceeds to buy an n-year annuity immediate, the annual payout will be $amt1.  
If a 2n-year annuity due is purchased, the annual payout will be $amt2.  Both calculations are based on an effective annual interest rate of i.  
Calculate i.
