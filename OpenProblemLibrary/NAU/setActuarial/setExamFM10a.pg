On January 1, 2004, Sam invests $DOLLAR 1000 in a fund for which the force of interest at time t is expressed by  \(\delta_t =(0.1)(t-1)^{$e}\), 
where t is the number of years since January 1, 2004. Calculate the accumulated value of the fund on January 1, $y.

$ans = 100/($e+1)*(($n-1)**($e+1)+1);
