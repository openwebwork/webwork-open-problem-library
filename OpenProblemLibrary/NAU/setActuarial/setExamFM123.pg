Dolly borrows $DOLLAR $amt on January 1, 2004 to be repaid in 12 annual installments at an effective annual rate of interest of $i $PERCENT.  
The first payment is due on January 1, 2005.  Instead of annual payments she decides to make monthly payments equal to one-twelfth the annual 
payment beginning on February 1, 2004.  Determine how many months will be needed to pay off the loan. (Round up to the nearest month.)
