The 1-year forward price of copper is $DOLLAR 1/lb.  The 1-year continuously compounded interest rate is 6%.  One-year option prices for copper are shown in the table below.

Suppose CDE mines copper, with fixed costs of $DOLLAR 0.50/lb and variable cost of $DOLLAR 0.40/lb. If CDE does nothing to manage copper risk:

$BR
What is its profit 1 year from now, per pound of copper, if the copper price in 1 year is $DOLLAR 0.80 $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
What is its profit 1 year from now, per pound of copper, if the copper price in 1 year is $DOLLAR 0.90 $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
What is its profit 1 year from now, per pound of copper, if the copper price in 1 year is $DOLLAR 1.00 $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
What is its profit 1 year from now, per pound of copper, if the copper price in 1 year is $DOLLAR 1.10 $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
What is its profit 1 year from now, per pound of copper, if the copper price in 1 year is $DOLLAR 1.20 $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?

If on the other hand CDE sells forward its expected copper production:
