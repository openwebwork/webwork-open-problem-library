TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose you short-sell $amt shares of ABC stock at $DOLLAR $ap with a commission charge of 0.$c $PERCENT. Supposing you pay commission charges for purchasing the security to cover the short-sale, how much profit (or loss) have you made if you close the short-sale at a price of $DOLLAR $bp ?
