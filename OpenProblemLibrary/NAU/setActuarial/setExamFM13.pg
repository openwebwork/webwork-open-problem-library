Fund A is invested at an effective annual interest rate of $a$PERCENT.  Fund B is invested at an effective annual interest rate of $b$PERCENT.  
At the end of 20 years, the total in the two funds is $DOLLAR 10,000.  At the end of 31 years, the amount in Fund A is twice the amount in Fund B.  
Calculate the total in the two funds at the end of 10 years.
