TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

1) Suppose you enter into a long 6-month forward position at a forward price of $DOLLAR $p.  What is the payoff in 6 months for prices of $DOLLAR $p1, $DOLLAR $p2,$DOLLAR $p,$DOLLAR $p3,$DOLLAR $p4 ?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p1, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p2, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p3, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p4, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR

2) Suppose you buy a 6-month call option with a strike price of $DOLLAR $p.  What is the payoff in 6 months for prices of the underlying asset of $DOLLAR $p1, $DOLLAR $p2,$DOLLAR $p,$DOLLAR $p3,$DOLLAR $p4 ?
$BR
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p1, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p2, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
$BR
When price is $DOLLAR $p3, the payoff is $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}?
