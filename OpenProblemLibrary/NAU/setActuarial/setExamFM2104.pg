TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Consider an n = 1 step binomial tree with T = .5.  Suppose r, the annualized risk-free rate is $r $PERCENT, and delta, the annualized dividend rate is $sd $PERCENT.  Also suppose the annualized standard deviation of the continuously compounded stock return, sigma, is $sig $PERCENT. Suppose further that the initial stock price, S = $DOLLAR $s; and that the strike price K is $DOLLAR $k. Suppose you observe a call price of $DOLLAR $arb, which is higher than the price for the European call option that you computed using the 1-step binomial tree method. By using the arbitrage method outlined in the book, that is, buying a synthetic call option and selling the actual call option:
