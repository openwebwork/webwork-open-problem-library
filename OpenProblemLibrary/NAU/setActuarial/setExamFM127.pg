TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Sharon buys a house.  She has limited initial funds, so she agrees to make 360 monthly payments as follows:
$BR
The first payment is to be $DOLLAR $pmt, with each subsequent payment increasing by $DOLLAR $i2.  
$BR The first payment is due one month after the date of the loan.  
$BR The nominal annual interest rate is $i1 $PERCENT compounded monthly.  
$BR Determine how much Sharon borrowed.
$BR
How much did Sharon borrow = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(40)\}?
