John is $a years old. He will receive 2 payments of $DOLLAR $b each.  
The first payment will be an unknown number of years in the future.  
The second payment will be $y years after the first payment. 
At an effective annual rate of interest of $i $PERCENT, the present 
value of the two payments is $DOLLAR $p.  Determine at what age John 
will receive the second payment.(Round to the nearest integer.)
