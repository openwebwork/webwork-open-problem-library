TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Two annuities have the same present value.  The first annuity is a decreasing annual annuity.  
The first payment is $DOLLAR $amt, due one year from today.  Subsequent annual payments decrease by $DOLLAR $d per year.  
The interest rate is $i $PERCENT compounded annually.  The second annuity provides payments of $DOLLAR K per month for $n years.  
The first payment is due one month from today.  What is K?

Value of K = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(40)\}?
