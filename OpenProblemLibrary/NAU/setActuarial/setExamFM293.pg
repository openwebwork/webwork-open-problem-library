TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose the A&T index is $s, the continuously compounded risk-free rate is $r $PERCENT, and the dividend yield is 0 $PERCENT.  A 1-year $k - strike European call costs $DOLLAR $c and a 1-year $k - strike European put cost $DOLLAR $p. Consider the strategy of buying the index, selling the $k - strike call, and buying the $k -strike put.

 $BR

What is the continuous rate of return on this position held until the expiration of the options \{ans_rule(20)\} $PERCENT?
