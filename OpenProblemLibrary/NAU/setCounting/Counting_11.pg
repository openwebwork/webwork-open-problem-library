How many ways are there to seat $b people in a row of $a chairs?

##Define variables to use in solution
$diff = $a - $b;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

Approach 1:  We can think of first choosing $b of the $a chairs for
people to sit in.  There are
\({$a \choose $b} = \frac{$a !}{$b ! $diff!}\) possible choices.
Then there are $b! possible ways for the $b people to sit in the $b 
chosen chairs.  So there are a total of
\[ {$a \choose $b} \cdot $b ! =\frac{$a !}{$b ! $diff!} \cdot $b! =
\frac{$a !}{$diff!} = $ans\]
possible ways to seat $b people in a row of $a chairs.
$PAR
Approach 2:  We can think of first choosing one of the $a chairs for
the first person, then choosing one of the $asub1 remaining chairs for
the second person, and so on.  This again gives a total of
\(  \frac{$a !}{$diff!} = $ans\) possible seating arrangements.
