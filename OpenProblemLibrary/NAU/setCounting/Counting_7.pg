TEXT(beginproblem());

## Define random numbers here
$A = random(12,18,1);

## Put text of question here
BEGIN_TEXT
There are 9 different positions on a baseball team.  If a team has $A 
players how many different line-ups can the team make?
$BR
The team can make \{ans_rule(15) \} different line-ups.
END_TEXT

$ans1 = fact($A)/fact($A- 9);

ANS(num_cmp ($ans1));

##Define variables for use in solution
$diff = $A - 9;
$Asub1 = $A - 1;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

Approach 1:  We can think of first choosing 9 of the $A available players
to actually play.  There are \({$A \choose 9} = \frac{$A !}{9! $diff!}\)
possible such choices.  Then there are 9! possible ways for the 9 chosen
players to be assigned to the 9 different positions.  So there are a total
of
\[ {$A \choose 9} \cdot 9! = \frac{$A !}{9 ! $diff!} \cdot 9! =
\frac{$A !}{$diff!} = $ans1\]
different possible line-ups.
$PAR
Approach 2:  We can think of first choosing one of the $A players for the
first position (e.g. first base), then choosing one of the $Asub1 remaining
players for the second position, and so on.  This again gives a total of
\( \frac{$A !}{$diff!} = $ans1\) possible line-ups.
