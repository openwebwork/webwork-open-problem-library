## Define random numbers here
$B = random(1,8,1);
$A = random(1,8,1);
$D = random(1,8,1);
$C = random(1,8,1);
@gender=('girl','boy');
$index=random(0,1,1);

## Put text of question here
BEGIN_TEXT
A $gender[$index] owns $A pairs of pants, $B shirts, $C ties, and $D jackets.  
How many different outfits can the $gender[$index] wear to school if
each outfit must consist of one of each item?
$BR$BR
There are \{ans_rule(20) \} different outfits.
END_TEXT

$ans1 = $A * $B * $C * $D;

ANS(num_cmp($ans1));

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));

By the generalized basic principle of counting, there are
\($A*$B*$C*$D=$ans1\) different outfits possible.
