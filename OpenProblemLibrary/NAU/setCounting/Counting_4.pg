BEGIN_TEXT
Standard automobile license plates in a country display $a numbers,
followed by $b letters, followed by $c numbers.
How many different standard plates are possible in this system?
(Assume lead 0 is not allowed, but repetitions of letters and numbers are allowed.)
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
