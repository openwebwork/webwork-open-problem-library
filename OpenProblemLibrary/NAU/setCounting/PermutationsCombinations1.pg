You are rearranging your bookshelf to make it more interesting and harder to find anything on it. 
On one of the shelves you plan to put $b biographies and $m mysteries. How many ways can you arrange 
them on the shelf if you don't want any two mystery books next to each other (i.e. they need to be 
separated by at least one biography, maybe more...).
