BEGIN_TEXT
There are $cd portable mini suites (a.k.a. cages) in a row at the Paws and Claws Holiday 
Pet Resort. They are neatly labeled with their guests' names. There are $d 
poodles and $c tabbies. How many ways can the "suites" be arranged if:
$BR
a) there are no restrictions.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$BR
b) cats and dogs must alternate.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$BR
c) dogs must be next to each other.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$BR
d) dogs must be next to each other and cats must be next to each other.

$PAR

a) If there are no restrictions, then this is just the total number of 
permutations of the $cd animals, which is $cd!.
$PAR

b) Note that since there is one more cat than dog, the first and last 
animals in the row must both be cats.  So there is no choice about 
which suites will house cats and which will house dogs.  Therefore the
only choices are the order of the cats among themselves and the order
of the dogs among themselves.  There are $c! permutations of the cats
and $d! permutations of the dogs, so there are a total of 
\($c! \cdot $d!\) possible arrangements of the suites.
$PAR

c) If the dogs must be next to each other, then we can think of 
arranging the dogs among themselves, arranging the cats among themselves, 
and then choosing  where among the cats to put the whole group of dogs.  
There are $d! arrangements of the dogs, $c! arrangements of the cats, 
and then \($c+1= $cadd1 \) positions where we could put the group dogs 
among the cats.  (The dogs could either all be before all the cats, 
between two of the cats, or after all the cats.)  Therefore there are 
a total of \($d! \cdot $c! \cdot $cadd1 = $d! \cdot $cadd1! \) 
possible arrangements of the suites.  
$PAR
Alternate approach:  There are $d! possible arrangements of the dogs 
among themselves.  Now, if we consider the dogs as one "object" 
together, then we can think of arranging the $c cats together with 
this 1 additional object.  There are $cadd1! such arrangements 
possible, so there are a total of \($d! \cdot $cadd1! \) 
possible arrangements of the suites.

$PAR
d) As in parts b) and c), there are $c! permutations of the cats and
$d! permutations of the dogs.  Since all the cats must be together 
and all the dogs must be together, either the cats are all before the
dogs or the dogs are all before the cats.  So for each choice of an 
arrangement of the cats and an arrangement of the dogs, there are 2 
possible arrangements of the suites.  Hence there are a total of 
\( 2 \cdot $c! \cdot $d!\) possible arrangements of the suites in 
this case.
