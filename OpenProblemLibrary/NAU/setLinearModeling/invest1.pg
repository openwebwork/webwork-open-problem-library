$renames splits an investment of  $DOLLAR$a , a portion earning simple interest at a rate of 
$r1 $PERCENT  per year and the rest earning at a rate of $r2  
$PERCENT 
per year in such a way  that the return on the total investment is 
\({$int:%0.02f}\)$PERCENT.
How much money was invested at each rate?  (Round to the nearest 100 dollars.)
