#
#  The student is asked to recover a formula from the graph.
#  The parameters of the function f(x) = a sqrt(bx + c) + d
#  are chosen so that the function has an x and y imtercept.
#  Thus, c is positive (so y-intercept exists)
#  and d = 0 or a * d is negative (so the x-intercept exists)
#
#  The student is given the hint that a = +/- 1.
#
#  The window is always chosen to be 11 units wide and 7 units high.
#  The position of the endpoint of the graph is (-c/b, d)
#  The parameter b is either +/-1, or +/-2 in which case c is odd
#
#  The sqrt function is a challenge to plotting.  Here there are 
#  two plots, one for the interval near the endpoint.
