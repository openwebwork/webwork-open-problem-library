## use the signs of f' and f'' to determine local max/min.
## 20% of the time f' != 0, so there is neither a max nor a min
## 16% of the time f' = f'' = 0, so we cannot tell
## 32$ of the time there is a local max
## 32% of the time there ia a local min

## There has to be a better way!  These four if statements are a pain.
