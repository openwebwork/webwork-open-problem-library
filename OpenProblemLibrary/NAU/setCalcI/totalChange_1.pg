TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
An oil tanker breaks apart and starts leaking.
As time goes on, the rate at which the oil is leaking out
will diminish.
Suppose that \(t\) hours after the tanker breaks apart, the
oil is leaking out at a rate of
\(R(t) = \frac{$a}{1 + t^2}\)
million gallons per minute. 
Then 
\{ans_rule( 20)\} million gallons
of oil will leak out in the first $bhours after the shipwreck.
