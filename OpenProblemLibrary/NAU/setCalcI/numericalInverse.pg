#DESCRIPTION
# Sept. 8, 2007
# use the intersect feature of your calculator to compute f^{-1} at one value
# f(x) = a x + b x^3 + c x^5, where a, b, and c are constants 0.1, 0.2, ... , 0.9
# This is chosen so that f^{-1} is not computable in closed form.
# (There might be some special cases: I didn't do the Galois theory.)

Find the approximate value of \(f^{-1}($y)\)
for the function \(f(x) = $a x + $b x^3 + $c x^5\).

$BBOLD
Hint:
$EBOLD
Do not try to find \(f^{-1}(x)\) for arbitrary \(x\); it's impossible.
Use the intersect feature on your calculator or some other technology.
Your answer needs to be correct to within one tenth of a percent.
