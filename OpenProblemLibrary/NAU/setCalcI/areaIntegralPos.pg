##DESCRIPTION
##  Find integral by interpreting as area
##  Based on pl/setIntegrals0Theory/osu_in_0_14.pg,
##  authored by Zig Fiedorowicz 5/12/2001
##  Changed by Jim Swift, so that all of the "y" values are positive, 11/25/2005
##  It was too much work to find the area of the region above and below the x-axis separately.
##  In fact, the original problem forced the y values to alternate in sign.
##  That might be OK if the x-intercepts are integers, but as it stood the integral was a mess to evaluate.

BEGIN_TEXT
You are given the four points in the plane \(A = ($x[0],$y[0])\),  
\(B = ($x[1],$y[1])\),  \(C = ($x[2],$y[2])\), and \(D = ($x[3],$y[3])\).
The graph of the function \(f(x)\) consists of the three line segments
\(AB\), \(BC\) and \(CD\).  Find the integral \( \displaystyle \int_{$x[0]}^{$x[3]} f(x)\,dx\)
by interpreting the integral in terms of sums of areas of
elementary figures.
