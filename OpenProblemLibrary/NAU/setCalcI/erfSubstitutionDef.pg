The error function, or erf, is
defied as
\[
{\rm erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} dt .
\]
The error function cannot be written in terms of elementary functions;
this is the simplest way to write it.
$BR
Do a substitution, changing the limits of integration, to write the following integral as \(a \, {\rm erf} (b)\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants.
Fill in the blanks with these constants.
