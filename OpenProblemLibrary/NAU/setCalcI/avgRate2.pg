It took $ti minutes for Usain the snail to reach the juicy rain drop that he discovered $di centimeters
from his home. Unfortunately, as soon as he reached the raindrop he was frightened by an aggressive
caterpillar so he immediately turned back. He was tired, so after his second $ti minutes he is 
only half way home. Hint: Speed is always nonnegative but velocity can be negative if the movement is backward.

$PAR
What is his average velocity?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(35) \} cm/min


$PAR
What is his average speed? 
$BR
\{ ans_rule(35) \} cm/min
