TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
An oil tanker breaks apart and starts leaking.
Suppose that right after the shipwreck, the oil is
leaking out at a rate of $r million gallons per minute,
and that the rate decays exponentially with a half-life
of $h minutes.
Then, \(t\) minutes after the shipwreck
the oil is leaking at a rate of \(R(t) = \)\{ans_rule( 20) \} million gallons per minute,
and
\{ans_rule( 30)\} million gallons
of oil will leak out in the first $b minutes after the shipwreck.
EOT

$rate = "$r * (0.5)**(t/$h)";
$total = $r * $h/ln(2) * (1 - $E**(-$b*ln(2)/$h));
&ANS(fun_cmp($rate, var =>'t'));
&ANS(std_num_cmp($total));
