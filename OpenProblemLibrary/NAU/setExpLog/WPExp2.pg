BEGIN_TEXT
In a certain country, the rate of deforestation is about $a$PERCENT per year.  Assume that the amount of forest remaining is given by the function
$PAR
\( F = F_0 e^{-$c t} \)
$BR
$BR
where \( F_0 \) is the present acreage of forest land and \( t \) is the time in years from the present.  In how many years will there be only $b$PERCENT  of the present acreage remaining?
$BR
Round your answer to three decimal places.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(20) \} years from now
