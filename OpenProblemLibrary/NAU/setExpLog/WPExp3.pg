BEGIN_TEXT
The probability that a $DOLLAR$d ticket DOES NOT win in the State Lottery is \( \frac{$a}{$b} \).  The probabilty \( p \) that \( n \) independently sold tickets are ALL losers and the jackpot rolls over is given by
$PAR
\( p =  (\frac{$a}{$b})^n \).
$PAR
As \( n \) increases, is \( p \) increasing or decreasing?  In other words, as the number of tickets sold increases, is the probability of a rollover increasing or decreasing?
$BR
\{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
For what number of tickets sold is the probability of a rollover greater than $c$PERCENT?
$BR
Fewer than \{ans_rule(20) \} tickets must be sold.
