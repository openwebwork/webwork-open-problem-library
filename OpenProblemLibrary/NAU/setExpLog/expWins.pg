# I used Mathematica to find the intersection points and just hard-wired them in.

BEGIN_TEXT
Compare the functions \(f(x) = x^{$a}\) and \(g(x) = e^x\)
by graphing both \(f\) and \(g\) on your calculator, using several viewing rectangles.
When does the graph of \(g\) finally surpass the graph of \(f\)?
$BR
The graphs intersect for the last time at \( x \approx \) \{ans_rule(10) \} .
(Round your answer to four significant figures.)
$PAR
Hints:
To get this much accuracy you can use the intersect feature of your calculator,
or make a very narrow \(x\) window.
You $BBOLD must $EBOLD round your answer or it will be marked wrong.
