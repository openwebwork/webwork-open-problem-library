A cable hangs between two poles of equal height and \($d\) feet apart.
Set up a coordinate system where the poles
are placed at \(x = -$b\) and \(x = $b\), where \(x\) is measured in feet. 
The height (in feet) of the cable at position \(x\) is
$BR
$BR
\[ h(x) = $a \cosh(x/$a), \]
$BR
where \( \cosh(x) = (e^x + e^{-x})/2\) is the hyperbolic cosine, which is
an important function in physics and engineering.
$BR
The cable is
\{ans_rule(20)\} feet long.
