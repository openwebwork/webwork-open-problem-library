COMMENT('Not randomized, but answer is symbolic. Based on Library/Michigan/Chap8Sec2/Q35.pg');

# This problem has no randomization. I (JWS) make no excuses.
# The students need to work some problems with variables for Length, etc. instead of just having numbers.
# We need MORE problems like this.  In the "old days" everbody had the same numbers on every problem.
# We don't need to randomize eveything.

# Note that the work is Force*L, which makes sense!
# If I pushed the front parabola toward the back, making the water overflow over the top,
# I would do Force*L amount of work, since Force is constant.
# Be careful:  If the trough were not full I could not apply this argument!

BEGIN_TEXT
A trough has a parabolic cross section
\( y=ax^2 \), where \( a \) is a constant.
The height is \( H \) meters and the length is  \( L \) meters.
The trough is filled with water.
For this problem, approximate the
weight density of water to be \(\rho g = 10^4\) Newtons per cubic meter.

$ECENTER
$BR
What is the work required to pump the water over the top of the trough?
$BR
Work = \{ ans_rule(35) \} Newton-meters.  (Your answer will involve \(L\), \(H\), and \(a\).)
$BR
What is the force due to hydrostatic pressure on one flat parabolic side?
$BR
Force = \{ ans_rule(35) \} Newtons.
