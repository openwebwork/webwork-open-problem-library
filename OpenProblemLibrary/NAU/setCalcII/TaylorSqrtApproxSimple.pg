The Taylor 
series for \( f(x) = \sqrt{$a + x} \) at \( a = 0 \)  is \( \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty
c_n( x )^n. \) $BR
Find the first few coefficients. $BR

\( c_0 = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}  $BR

\( c_1 = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}  $BR

\( c_2 = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}  $BR

\( c_3 = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}  $BR

Find the error in approximating \(\sqrt{$c} = f($b)\) using the third degree
Taylor polynomial of \(f\) at \( a = 0 .\) 
$BR
That is, find the error of the approximation \(\sqrt{$c} \approx T_3($b)\).
$BR
$BR
The absolute value of the error is  \{ans_rule(70)\}
