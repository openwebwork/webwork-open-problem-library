$PAR
A forest ranger is watching the progress of a forest fire spreading towards her from the top 
of a $h-foot mesa.  In $t minutes, the angle of depression to the leading edge of the fire 
changes from \( $a ^ \circ \) to \( $b ^ \circ \).
$PAR
How many feet does the fire advance during the $t minutes that the ranger is observing it?
$BR
(Round your answer to two decimal places.)
$PAR
\{ ans_rule(15) \} feet
$PAR
$PAR
At what speed (in MILES PER HOUR) is the fire spreading towards the ranger?
$BR
(Round your answer to two decimal places.)
$PAR
\{ ans_rule(15) \} miles per hour
