BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
An aerial photograph from a U-2 spy plane is taken of a building suspected of housing
nuclear warheads.  When the photograph is taken, the angle of elevation of the sun 
is \( $a ^ \circ \).  By comparing the shadow cast by the building in question to the shadows of 
other objects of known size in the photograph, scientists determine that the shadow 
of the building in question is $b feet long.
$PAR
How tall is the bulding?  (Round your answer to two decimal places.)
$PAR
\{ ans_rule(15) \} feet
