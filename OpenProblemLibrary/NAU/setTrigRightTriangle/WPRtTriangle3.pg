$PAR
The official Visual Flight Rules require that the distance between the ground and the 
bottom of the clouds to be more than 1000 feet for a plane to fly without instrumentation. At night, cloud height can be determined by aiming a searchlight straight upward and having an observer find the angle of elevation to the point at which the light hits the clouds.  Suppose the observer stands $observer feet away from the searchlight and sights the beam of light on the clouds with an angle of elevation \( $angle ^ \circ \).
$PAR
What is the height of the cloud cover?
$BR
(Round your answer to two decimal places.)
$BR
 \{ ans_rule(15) \} feet
$PAR
$PAR
Would the Visual Flight Rules allow a plane to fly without instrumentation in these conditions?
$BR
Answer 'yes' or 'no'.
$BR
\{ ans_rule(5) \}
