TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A company borrows $DOLLAR$A, which will be paid back to the lender in one 
payment at the end of $b years. The company agrees to pay $readj interest payments
at the nominal annual rate of $c$PERCENT compounded $readj. At the same time the company 
sets up a sinking fund in order to repay the loan at the end of $b years. The
sinking fund pays interest at an annual nominal interest rate of $c1$PERCENT compounded
$readj.
Find the total amount of the $readj payments, that is, the sum of the interest payment and the sinking fund payment. 
$BR
Total $readj payment  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
