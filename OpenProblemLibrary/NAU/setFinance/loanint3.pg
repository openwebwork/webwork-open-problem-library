Stereo Inc. sells a stereo system for $DOLLAR$D down and monthly payments of 
$DOLLAR$P for the next $b years.
If the interest rate is $c$PERCENT per month, find:
$BR
a) The cost of the stereo.
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
Hint: Make sure you are using the $BITALIC MONTHLY $EITALIC interest rate, meaning $c $PERCENT is APR/12.$BR
$BR
b) The total amount of interest paid.
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
