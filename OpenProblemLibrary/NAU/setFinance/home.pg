## Altered by C. Tyler Diggans on 8/2012 at NAU
## I changed the part about 5 yr or 25 yr equity to just involve the first payment This is due to the lack of emphasis on amortization tables in MAT114

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A couple has decided to purchase a $DOLLAR$A house using a down payment of
$DOLLAR$D. They can amortize the balance at $c$PERCENT over $b years.

$BR
a) What is their monthly payment?
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
b) What is the total interest paid?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
c) How much of their first payment went toward paying interest?
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}

$BR
d) How much of their first payment went toward paying the balance of the loan. 
$BR
Answer = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
