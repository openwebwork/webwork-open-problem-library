TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A $reore mine is expected to yield an annual income of $DOLLAR$P 
for the next $b years, after which it will be sold for $DOLLAR$P1.
An investor wants an annual return on his investment of 
$c$PERCENT.  If he can establish a sinking fund earning 
an annual interest rate of $c1$PERCENT, how much should he pay 
for the mine?

$ans = ($P*$fac + $P1)/($r*$fac+1);
