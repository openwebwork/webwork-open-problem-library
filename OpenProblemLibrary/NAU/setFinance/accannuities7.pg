TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A $reore mine is expected to yield a constant annual income 
for the next $b years, after which it will be sold for $DOLLAR$P1.
An investor wants an annual return on his investment of 
$c$PERCENT, so he pays $DOLLAR$ans for the mine. If he can establish 
a sinking fund earning an annual interest rate of $c1$PERCENT, to 
which he pays an annual payment that will accumulate to his total 
outlay for the mine, what is the constant annual income from the 
mine?
$BR
Answer  = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
