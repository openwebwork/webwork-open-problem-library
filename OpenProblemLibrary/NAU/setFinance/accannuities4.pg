TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$rebname and $regname would like to have $DOLLAR$A for a down payment on a house.
Their budget only allows them to save $DOLLAR$ans per $renoun.
How many years will it take them to save up the desired amount of $DOLLAR$A? Here we assume that their saving account will pay $c$PERCENT 
compounded $readj.
$BR
Answer  = \{ans_rule(20)\} years.
