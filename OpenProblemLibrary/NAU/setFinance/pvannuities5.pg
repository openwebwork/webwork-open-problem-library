TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Mr. Smith bought a $DOLLAR $V0 house $y1 years ago. The house is now worth $DOLLAR $V1 .
Originally, the house was financed by paying $d1$PERCENT down with the rest financed 
through a $y2-year mortgage at $c1$PERCENT interest. After making $numpmt monthly house payments,Mr. Smith is now in need of cash, and would like to refinance the house. The
finance company is willing to loan $d2$PERCENT of the current value of the house amortized 
over $y3 years at $c2$PERCENT interest. 
$BR
How much cash will the owner receive after paying the balance 
$BR
of the original loan?
$BR
$BR
Amount of cash obtained =  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
$BR
If he uses all of the available cash for something 
$BR
other than investing in his home, 
$BR
by how much will his monthly payment increase? 
$BR
$BR
Increase in monthly payment =  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
