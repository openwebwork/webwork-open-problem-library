A person has two credit cards with annual interest rates of $P1 $PERCENT and $P2 $PERCENT respectively. This month, 
the total interest for the month due on the balances is \( \~~${$totint:%0.2f} \)
and the interest due on the first card (at $P1 $PERCENT) is \( \~~${$dd:%0.2f} \)  $str the interest due on the second card.  Find the balances on the two cards.

$BR
Balance on the second card = $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}.
