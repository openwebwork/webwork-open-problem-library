BEGIN_TEXT
A man flies a small airplane from Fargo to Bismarck, North Dakota ---
a distance of 180 miles. Because he is flying into a head wind, 
the trip takes him 2 hours. On the way back, the wind is still blowing at
the same speed, so the return trip takes only 1 hour 12 minutes. What
is his speed in still air, and how fast is the wind blowing?

$BR
Your answer is
$BR
his speed equals \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
the wind speed equals \{ans_rule(25) \}
