Imagine that you've just won the new University of Virginia MiniLottery, and have two
options for the payment of your prize.  The first is to receive three equal
annual payments (the first coming immediately) of $d1 dollars apiece.  The
second is to immediately receive a single payment of $d2 dollars.  If
lottery Commissioner Sandridge claims that the two options are equivalent, 
what effective rate of interest is being assumed?
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.

$ans = 100*(($d1+(-3*$d1**2 + 4*$d1*$d2)**(.5))/(2*($d2-$d1))-1);
ANS(num_cmp($ans) );
