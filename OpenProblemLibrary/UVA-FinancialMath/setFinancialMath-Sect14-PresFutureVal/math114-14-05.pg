TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Assume that you make the following three investments: $a dollars
now, $b dollars in two years, and $c dollars in 5 years.  All
three investments earn simple interest at the same rate.  If the
accumulated value of the sum of the three investments 10 years
after the initial investment is $d dollars, what is the rate of interest?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
