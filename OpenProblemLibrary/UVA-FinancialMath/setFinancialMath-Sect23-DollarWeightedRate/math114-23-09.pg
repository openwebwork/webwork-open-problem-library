TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Gretchen invests $a dollars in a mutual fund on January 1.  
On March 1, she learns that her fund balance is $b dollars, 
and she then withdraws $c dollars.
On August 1, her fund balance is $d dollars, and she
then deposits $e1 dollars.  On the following January 1, her
fund balance is $f dollars.  What
is Gretchen's dollar-weighted rate of return? 
(Assume simple interest and months of equal length.)
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
