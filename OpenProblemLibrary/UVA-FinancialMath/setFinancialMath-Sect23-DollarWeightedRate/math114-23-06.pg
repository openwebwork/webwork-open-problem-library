TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Wanda invests $a dollars in a mutual fund on January 1.  On June
1, her fund balance is $b dollars. Unfazed, she invests an additional $c dollars.
On September 1, her fund balance is $d dollars.  She
then withdraws $e1 dollars.  On the following January 1, her
fund balance is $f dollars.  What
is Wanda's dollar-weighted rate of return? (Assume simple interest and
months of equal length.)
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
