Mark invests $d1 dollars.  Two years later, he receives a payment from the investment
of $w1 dollars.  Two years after that, he invests another $d2 dollars, and two years
after that, he adds $d3 dollars more to the investment.  Two years later, he receives a
final payment of $bal dollars that closes out the investment.  What are the possible
effective rates of interest?  (If you find more than one, list them separated by
commas.)

Answer(s) = \{ &ans_rule(40) \} percent.
