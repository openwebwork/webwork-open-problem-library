Dennis invests $a dollars in a mutual fund on January 1.  On May
1, his fund balance is $b dollars, and he withdraws $c dollars.
On the following January 1, his fund balance is $d dollars.  What
is Dennis' dollar-weighted rate of return? (Assume simple interest and
months of equal length.)

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
