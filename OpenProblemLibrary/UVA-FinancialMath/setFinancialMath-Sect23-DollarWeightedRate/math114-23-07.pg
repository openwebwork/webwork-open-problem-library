TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Molly establishes a line of credit with a deposit of $d1 dollars.  Two months
later, she withdraws $w1 dollars.  Three months after that, she deposits $d2
dollars.  Two months after that, she withdraws $w2 dollars.  Three months after
that, she deposits $d3 dollars.  A year after establishing the line of
credit, she makes a withdrawal of $bal dollars that closes the account. 
What are the possible nominal rates of interest
convertible monthly?  (If you find more than one, list them separated
by commas.)
