Molly establishes a line of credit with a deposit of $d1 dollars.  Two years
later, she withdraws $w1 dollars.  Three years after that, she deposits $d2
dollars.  Two years after that, she withdraws $w2 dollars.  Three years after
that, she deposits $d3 dollars.  Fifteen years after establishing the line of
credit, she makes a withdrawal of 4500 dollars that closes the account. 
 Let  \( i \)  be the effective rate of interest.  
Set up an equation of value for this problem that would be used to solve for the possible 
effective rates of interest.  Make the substitution \(x=1+i\) to 
get an equation in the variable \(x\).  Fill in the missing portion of this 
equation below:

$ans = " $d1*x**15 - $w1*x**13 + $d2*x**10 - $w2*x**8 + $d3*x**5 ";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans, vars=>"x"));
