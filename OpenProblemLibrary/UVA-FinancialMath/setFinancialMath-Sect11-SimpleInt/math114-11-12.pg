On January 1, you put $B dollars into a mutual fund to save for graduate school.
On March 1, your fund balance is $b dollars and you then deposit $d 
dollars.  On the following January 1, your fund balance is \(X\) dollars.  
If your time weighted rate of return for the 
year was $rp percent, what is \(X\)?  

$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars.
