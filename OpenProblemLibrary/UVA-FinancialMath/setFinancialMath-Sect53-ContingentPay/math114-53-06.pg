TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A credit union makes a loan of $n dollars, to be repaid with $m
equal annual payments, the first coming a year from now.  They desire a $yp
percent effective yield on the loan, and estimate that there is a $dp
percent chance that any given payment will be missed.  (However, a missed payment
 does
not change the likelihood of later payments being made.)  How much should
the annual payments be?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $n/($am*(1-$d));
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol=>.02) );
