TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

You have an investment opportunity to receive 1000 dollars at the end of 
each year for the next 3 years.  The probability of receiving the first 
payment is $p, and the probability of receiving the second is $q. 
If the expected yield rate is $yp percent effective, and the expected present 
value is $e dollars, what is the probability of receiving the third payment?


$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
