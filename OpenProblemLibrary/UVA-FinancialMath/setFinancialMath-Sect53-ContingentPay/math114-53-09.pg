TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A loan of $n dollars is to be repaid with annual payments for $m years,
with the first coming a year from now.  There is a $dp percent chance that a
given payment won't be made, and once a payment is missed, no further
payments are made.  If the lender desires a yield of $yp percent effective, how much
should each of the annual payments be?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $n/$am;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol=>.02) );
