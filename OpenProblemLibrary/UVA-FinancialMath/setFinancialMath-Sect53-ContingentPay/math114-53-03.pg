TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that on all loans to be repaid with a single payment in one year,
a lending institution charges an effective rate of $ip percent, in order to
obtain an effective yield of $yp percent.  What percentage of loans is the 
bank assuming will not be repaid?  (Note: Assume that the loans will be repaid in 
full or not at all.) 

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent. $BR

EOT

$ans = 100*(1 - (1+$y)/(1+$i));
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .001) );
