TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Your cousin Vern hits you up for a loan, and tells you that he'll pay you
back $n dollars a year from now.  You'd like an expected yield of $yp percent and
believe that the likelihood of Vern not paying you back is $dp percent.  How
much should you loan him?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $n*(1-$d)/(1+$y);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol=>.01) );
