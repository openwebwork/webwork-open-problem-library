TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that a stock price is currently $s dollars,
and it is known that three months from now, the price will be either
$ip percent higher or $ip percent lower.  Suppose further that you
set up a riskless portfolio that consists of shorting 1 European call
option with a strike price of $str dollars, and purchasing an appropriate number of shares of the
stock.  Assuming that no arbitrage opportunities exist and a
risk-free interest rate of $rp percent, what is the value of the riskless portfolio three months
before the exercise date?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $riskless;
