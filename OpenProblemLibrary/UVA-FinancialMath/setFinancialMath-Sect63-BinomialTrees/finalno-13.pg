TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that you buy for $K2 dollars a share of stock.  In order to hedge 
your investment, you decide to also buy 2 put options and sell 1 call option on the same 
stock.  Each put costs $c1 dollars and has a strike price of $K1 dollars.
The call costs $c3 dollars, and has a strike price of $K3 dollars.
Find (if it exists) the maximum possible profit for your portfolio 
on the exercise date. If there is no maximum, then write "None" for your answer.
(Note: your portfolio contains options and a share of stock.)$BR
