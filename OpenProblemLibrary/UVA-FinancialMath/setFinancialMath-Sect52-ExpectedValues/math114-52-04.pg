TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A game of chance involves rolling an unevenly balanced 4-sided
die.  The probability that a roll comes up 1 is $a, the
probability that a roll comes up 1 or 2 is $b, and the probability
that a roll comes up 2 or 3 is $c .  If you win the amount that
appears on the die, what is your expected winnings? (Note that the 
die has 4 sides.)
