Jeff is producing an outdoor concert.  He estimates that he will make $a dollars 
if it does not rain, and make $b dollars if it does rain.  The local weather station 
(which we'll assume is accurate in giving forecasts) predicts that the chance of 
rain is $c percent for the day of the concert.  What is Jeff's expected earnings 
from the concert?

Answer =  \{ans_rule(25) \} dollars.
