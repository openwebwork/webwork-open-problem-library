TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The State of Denial decides to hold a lottery, and sells $X tickets.  
Of these, 1 pays a grand prize which consists of an annuity of 
$n equal annual payments of $P dollars each,
with the first payment of the annuity coming 1 year from now.  In addition, $R other 
tickets pay a prize of $b dollars, and $S tickets pay a prize of $c dollars. 
(The rest of the tickets win nothing.)  Assuming an effective 
rate of $ip percent for the annuity, what is the expected value (i.e. expected winnings) of a single ticket?

Answer =  \{ans_rule(25) \} dollars.
