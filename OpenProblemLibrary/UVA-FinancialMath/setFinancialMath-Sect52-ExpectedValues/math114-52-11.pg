TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A state lottery sells $X tickets.  
Of these, 1 wins the grand prize which is a perpetuity with equal annual payments of 
$P dollars, with the first payment coming 1 year from now.  In addition, $R other 
tickets pay a prize of $b dollars, and $S tickets pay a prize of $c dollars. 
(The rest of the tickets win nothing.)  Assuming an effective 
rate of $ip percent for the perpetuity, 
what is the price of a single ticket so that this is a "fair" lottery?


$BR

Answer =  \{ans_rule(25) \} dollars.
