A game of chance involves rolling a ${n}-sided die once.  If a number from 1 to 3
comes up, you win $a dollars.  If the number 4 or 5 comes up, you win $b
dollars.  If any other number comes up, you lose.  If it costs $c dollars to
play, what is your expected net winnings?

$ans =  (3*$a + 2*$b )/$n - $c;
