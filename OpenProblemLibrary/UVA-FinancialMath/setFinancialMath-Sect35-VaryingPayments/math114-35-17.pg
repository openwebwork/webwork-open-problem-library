Karen makes a sequence of annual deposits into an account paying an
effective rate of interest of $ip percent.  The first deposit of $p dollars
comes one year from now, and each subsequent deposit is $q dollars larger
than the last.  If she will make $n such deposits, what is their present value now?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $p*$an + ($q/$i)*($an - $n*(1+$i)**(-$n));
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
