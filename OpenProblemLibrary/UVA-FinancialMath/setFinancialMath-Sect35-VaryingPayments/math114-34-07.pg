TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Snoopy borrows $a dollars to pay for his new super-deluxe doghouse.  
To pay off the loan, he agrees to make monthly interest payments on 
the loan, and will also build up a sinking fund with equal monthly deposits to repay 
the principal with a single payment $n months 
from now. If the interest rate on the loan is
$ip percent, and the interest paid on the sinking fund is $jp percent, both
nominal convertible monthly, what is Snoopy's total outlay?  
(Assume the first interest payment 
and the first sinking fund deposit will both come in one month.)

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $sdep + $intpay;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol=>.01) );
