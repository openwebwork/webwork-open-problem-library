Karen borrows $a dollars today, and agrees to repay the loan by making annual
interest payments to the lender, and by also accumulating a sinking fund with
increasing annual deposits to repay the principal.  The interest rate on the loan is
$ip percent, and the interest paid on the sinking fund is $jp percent, both
effective.  If the loan is to be settled $n years from
now, and the sinking fund deposits increase by $kp percent per year,
what is Karen's total outlay at the end of the 4th year?  (Assume the first interest
payment and sinking fund deposits are both due in one year.)

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
