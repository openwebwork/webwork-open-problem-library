Jill borrows $a dollars from a line of credit at a rate of $ip percent
convertible monthly.  At the end of each month, in addition to the interest charged
on the account balance, there is a fee charged to the account.  The fee 
is $f dollars at the end of
the first month, and will increase by $jp percent each month that follows.
How much does Jill owe after $m months have passed, assuming
she makes no payments?  (Note: Assume that 
she has just been charged the interest and fee for the ${m}th month.)
