TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose you take out a ${t}-year loan at an interest 
rate of $ip percent convertible monthly.  You will make monthly payments, with your first payment coming
in one month.  Your first payment will be for 
$p dollars, and your payments will increase by $q dollars per month. 
How much interest is in the ${k}th payment?  

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$h = $n - ($k-1);
$ah = (1-$I**(-$h))/$i;
$outbal = ($p + ($k-1)*$q)*$ah + $q*($ah-$h*$I**(-$h))/$i;


$ans = $outbal*$i;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .01) );
