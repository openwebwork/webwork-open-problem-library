TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Erin borrows $a dollars today, and agrees to repay the loan by making annual
interest payments to the lender, and by also accumulating a sinking fund with
increasing annual deposits to repay the principal.  The interest rate on the loan is
$ip percent, and the interest paid on the sinking fund is $jp percent, both
effective.  If the loan is to be settled $n years from
now, and the sinking fund deposits increase by $q dollars per year,
what is Erin's total outlay 6 years after taking out the loan?  (Assume the first interest
payment and sinking fund deposits are both due one year after taking out the loan.)


$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $intpay + $firstsdep + 5*$q;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.2f', tol=>.02) );
