TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

You open a savings account with an interest rate of 
$ip percent convertible quarterly, into which you plan to make deposits 
four times each year. Your first deposit will be $p dollars, 
and each subsequent deposit is $q dollars larger
than the last.  
How much is in the account immediately after your ${n}th deposit?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $p*$sn + ($q/$i)*($sn - $n);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .01) );
