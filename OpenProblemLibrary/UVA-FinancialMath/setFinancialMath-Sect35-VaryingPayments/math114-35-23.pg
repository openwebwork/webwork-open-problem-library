TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

To purchase a new couch that costs $a dollars, you set up a store credit 
card that charges interest at $ip percent convertible monthly, beginning immediately. 
Each month that you do not make a payment (starting one month after you purchase the couch), you are charged 
a $X dollar fee that is added to your card balance. 
Due to financial difficulties, you cannot make a 
payment until $t months after you purchase the couch. 
To pay off the card balance, you decide to make $n monthly 
payments that increase by $jp percent per month. How much is your first payment?
