Sandra makes a sequence of $n annual deposits into an account paying
an effective rate of $ip percent.  The deposits increase by a fixed percentage from one to the next, and the last deposit is $m times as large as the first.  If the account balance is $d dollars immediately
after the last deposit is made, how large is the last deposit?
