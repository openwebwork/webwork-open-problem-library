Craig borrows $a dollars a year to pay for 
college expenses, starting on September 1, 2000 - the day he starts college - and ending on September 1, 2004.  (i.e. that's 5 withdrawals total).  After graduation, 
he decides to go to graduate school in 
mathematics, and his loans are deferred (i.e. they 
still accrue interest, but no payments are due).  
After graduation from graduate school, he needs to begin 
paying off his loans.  He will make monthly payments 
for $n years, and each payment will increase by $jp percent.  
His payments will begin on July 1, 2007,  
exactly 6 years and 10 months after he started college. 
If he pays a nominal rate of $ip percent convertible 
monthly for the entire life of the loans, 
what will be the size of his first payment?
