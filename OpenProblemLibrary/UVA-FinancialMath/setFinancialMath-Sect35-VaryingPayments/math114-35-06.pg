TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Bart borrows $loan dollars, and agrees to repay the loan with a sequence of
$n annual payments, the first coming a year from now.  He further agrees
that each payment will be $q dollars larger than the one before it.  If the effective
rate of interest is $ip percent, how much is his 3rd payment?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $p + 2*$q;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .01) );
