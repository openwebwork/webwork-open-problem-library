TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

The Little Red-Haired Girl makes quarterly deposits into an account paying an 
interest rate of $ip percent per quarter.  The first deposit is $p dollars, and 
each subsequent deposit is $q dollars SMALLER than the previous one.  How much is 
in the account immediately after the ${n}th deposit?


$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $p*$sn - ($q/$i)*($sn - $n);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .01) );
