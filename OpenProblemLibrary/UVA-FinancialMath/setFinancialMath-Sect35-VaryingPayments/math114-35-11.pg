TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Jeremy takes out a loan at an effective interest rate of $ip percent.  
He will make $n annual payments, with the first
payment due in one year.  The first payment will be $p dollars, 
and each payment that follows will 
be $jp percent more than the previous payment.
How much does he owe on the loan
immediately after the 15th payment?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = ($p*($J)**15)*(1-($I/$J)**(-$n+15))/($i-$j);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .1) );
