Grandpa Joe decides to purchase a trust fund for his grandson Danny.  The fund 
will start making payments 6 months from now, and will make semiannual payments 
forever.  Grandpa Joe would like the payments to be of the 
form \(X, 2X, X, 2X, X, 2X,\ldots\), but it would cost him $PV dollars for such a fund.  
Since he doesn't want to spend that much money, he instead decides to purchase a trust 
fund where the first $n payments will be for $P dollars each, and then the remaining payments will be of the form \(X, 2X, X, 2X, X, 2X,\ldots\).
If the interest rate is $ip percent convertible semiannually, what is the price that Grandpa Joe pays for this trust fund?
