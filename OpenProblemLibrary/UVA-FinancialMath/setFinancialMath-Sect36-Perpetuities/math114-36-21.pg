Suppose that a perpetuity will make payments every 3 years, with the first payment 
coming $m years from now.  Suppose further that the first payment is $a dollars, and 
that each subsequent payment is $jp percent larger than the last.  If the effective 
rate of interest is $ip percent, find the present value of this perpetuity.
