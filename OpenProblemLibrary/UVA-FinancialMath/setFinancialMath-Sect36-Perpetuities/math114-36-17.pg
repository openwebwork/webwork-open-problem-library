Suppose that a perpetuity makes annual payments, the first coming one year from now.
The first payment is $p dollars, and each payment thereafter is $jp percent larger than
the one before it.  If the effective rate of interest is $ip percent, what is the
present value of the perpetuity?

$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
