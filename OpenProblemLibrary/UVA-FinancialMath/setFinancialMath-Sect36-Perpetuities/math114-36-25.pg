Linus would like to start saving for his retirement.  Starting April 1, 1950, he will make 
annual deposits into an account, with the last deposit coming on April 1, 1990.
Linus assumes he will get pay raises, and plans to increase his deposits by $jp percent 
each year.  If he would like to be able to withdraw $x dollars per year forever, 
with the first withdrawal on April 1, 1993, how much will Linus's first deposit need to 
be?  (Assume an interest rate of $ip percent effective throughout.)
