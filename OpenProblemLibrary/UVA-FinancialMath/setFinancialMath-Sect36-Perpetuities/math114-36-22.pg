TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that today is January 1, 2003.  A perpetuity makes annual payments,
the first coming on January 1, ${y1}.  The first payment is for $d dollars,
and each payment up to (and including) the one on January 1, $y2 
is $jp percent larger than the previous payment.
After that, the payments increase by $c dollars annually.  What is the
present value of the perpetuity today, assuming an effective rate of $ip
percent?
