TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Pam's fairy-godmother agrees to buy her a perpetuity that will make annual payments.
The first payment will be $p dollars and will come one year from now, 
and the payments will increase by $q dollars every year after that. If Pam's 
fairy-godmother gets an effective interest rate of $ip percent, what will be the 
price of the perpetuity?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $p/$i + $q/$i**2;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.2f', tol => .01) );
