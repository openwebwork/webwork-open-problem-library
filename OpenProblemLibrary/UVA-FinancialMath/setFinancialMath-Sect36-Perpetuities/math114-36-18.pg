TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Jeff would like to retire exactly $n years from now.  He is planning on saving up money to 
buy a perpetuity on the day he retires.  He would like the perpetuity to pay him annual payments, 
with the first payment coming one year after he retires.  He would like the first payment to be
$X dollars, and then each payment thereafter will increase by $q dollars.  
In order to save up money, Jeff will make annual deposits, 
starting a year from now, with the last coming on the day he retires.  His deposits will 
increase by $jp percent each year.  If both the perpetuity and his savings account earn 
$ip percent effective, how large will his first deposit be?
