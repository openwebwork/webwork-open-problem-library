TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Alex Rodriguez recently signed a contract with the Texas Rangers that will
pay him approximately 250 million dollars over the next 10 years.  In this
problem, assume that he will receive his pay annually in 25 million dollar
installments, and that he has just received the first payment.  Suppose that
he decides to set aside a fixed amount each year to fund a perpetuity of $a
dollars per year for his retirement, with the first payment to come in $n years. If
the effective rate of interest is $ip percent, how much of his annual salary
will be left, after he makes his perpetuity investment?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = 25000000 - $a/($i*$s10*(1+$i)**($n - 10));
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => 1) );
