TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that a loan is being repaid with 20 annual payments,
with the first payment coming one year from now. The
first 5 payments are for $a dollars, the next 8 are $b dollars
each, and the final 7 are $c dollars each.  If the effective rate
of interest is $ip percent, how much interest is in the 11th
payment?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $b + ($c-$b)*(1+$i)**(-3) - $c*(1+$i)**(-10);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f') );
