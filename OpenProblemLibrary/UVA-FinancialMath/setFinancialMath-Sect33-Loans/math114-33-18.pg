TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Dave takes out a ${t}-year mortgage of $a dollars for his new house. 
Dave gets an interest rate of $ip percent convertible monthly.  
He agrees to make equal monthly payments, the first coming in one month. 
After making the ${k}th payment, Dave wants to buy a boat, so he wants to 
refinance his house to reduce his monthly payment by $r dollars, and to 
get a better interest rate.  In particular, he negotiates a new rate 
of $yp percent convertible monthly, and agrees to make equal monthly payments 
(each $r dollars less than his original payments) for as long as necessary, 
followed by a single smaller payment. How large will Dave's final loan payment be?
