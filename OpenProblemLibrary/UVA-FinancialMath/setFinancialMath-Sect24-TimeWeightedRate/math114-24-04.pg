TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Your grandmother gives you $a1 dollars for your birthday, which you invest in a 
mutual fund on January 1, 2002.  On June 1, 2002, she gives you $a2 dollars 
for your high school graduation, which you immediately deposit into your mutual fund.  
On January 1, 2003, you take out your calculator and find that your dollar 
weighted rate of return for the previous year was $ip percent.  
On April 1, 2003 your fund balance is 
$b dollars and you then deposit your grandmother's Easter gift of 
\(X\) dollars.  On January 1, 2004, your fund balance is $d dollars
and you calculate that your time weighted rate of return for the previous 
year was $rp percent.  What is \(X\)?  (As usual, assume simple interest 
for the dollar weighted rate of return, and months of equal length.)
