TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Wendel invests $a dollars in a mutual fund on January 1.  On June
1, his fund balance is $b dollars. Wendel notices the decline,
and withdraws $c dollars.
On September 1, his fund balance is $d dollars, and he 
then invests an additional $e1 dollars.  On the following January 1, his
fund balance is $f dollars.  What
is Wendel's time-weighted rate of return?
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.

$ans = 100*(($b/$a)*($d/($b-$c))*($f/($d+$e1)) - 1);
