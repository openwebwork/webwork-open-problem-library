TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that you open a mutual fund account with a deposit
of $d1 dollars.  $t1 months later, the fund balance is $b2 dollars, and you withdraw
$d2 dollars.  A year after the account was opened, your balance is \(X\) dollars.
If the dollar weighted and time weighted rates of return were the same, what is the
rate of return?  (Assume simple interest for the dollar weighted
calculation.)
