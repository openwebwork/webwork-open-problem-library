John invests $d1 dollars in a mutual fund on January 1.  On February
1, his fund balance is $b2 dollars,
and he invests an additional $d2 dollars.
On May 1, his fund balance is $b3 dollars, and he withdraws $w1 dollars.
On August 1, his fund balance is $b4 dollars, and he withdraws another
 \(!{$w2:%10.2f}\) dollars.  On the following January 1, his
fund balance is \(!{$b5:%10.2f}\) dollars.  What
is John's time-weighted rate of return?
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
