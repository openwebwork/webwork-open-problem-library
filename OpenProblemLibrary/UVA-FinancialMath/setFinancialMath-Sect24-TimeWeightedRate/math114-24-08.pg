TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suzanne invests $a dollars in the Nguyen Mutual Fund on January 1.  On March
1, her fund balance is $b dollars, and she invests an additional $c dollars.
On October 1, her fund balance is $d dollars, and she
then withdraws $e1 dollars.  On the following January 1, her
fund balance is $f dollars.  What
is Suzanne's time-weighted rate of return?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
