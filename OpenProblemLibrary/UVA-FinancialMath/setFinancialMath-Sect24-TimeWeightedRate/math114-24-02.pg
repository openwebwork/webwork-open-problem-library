TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Wally invests $a dollars in a mutual fund on January 1.  On June
1, his fund balance is $b dollars. Wally doesn't notice the decline,
and invests an additional $c dollars.
On September 1, his fund balance is $d dollars.  He
then withdraws $e1 dollars.  On the following January 1, his
fund balance is $f dollars.  What
is Wally's time-weighted rate of return?
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent.
