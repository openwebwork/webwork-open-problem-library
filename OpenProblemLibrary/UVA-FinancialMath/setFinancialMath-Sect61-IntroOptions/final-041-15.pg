TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Grandpa buys 1000 call options for $c dollars each, with a strike price of $k dollars.
On the expiration date, the stock price is $s dollars, and Grandpa's first grandson is born.
Grandpa immediately uses the profit from the options to purchase a trust fund for 
his grandson.  The fund will make monthly payments, starting 14 years from now (when Grandpa
expects him to begin high school).  The payments will increase by $q dollars each month, 
and will last forever.
Assuming an interest rate of $ip percent convertible monthly, what 
is the amount of the first trust fund payment? 

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $P;
ANS(num_cmp($ans,tol=>.01) );
