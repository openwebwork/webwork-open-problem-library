One bond, with a face value of 1000 dollars and annual coupons at a rate
of $r1p percent effective, has a price of $p1 dollars.
A second bond, with a face value of 1000 dollars and annual coupons at a rate
of $r2p percent effective, has a price of $p2 dollars.  Both
bonds are redeemable at par in the same number of years, and have the same
yield rate.  Find the yield rate.  (Give your answer as an effective rate.)
