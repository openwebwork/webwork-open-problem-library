TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Cicely invests $a dollars in an account paying an effective rate of interest of $ip percent.  Two years later, she deposits an additional $w dollars.  
If there are no other transactions, how long will it take (from the time of the first investment) for her account
balance to reach $b dollars?  (Assume simple interest between compoundings.)
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(10) \} years and \{ &ans_rule(10) \} days.
$BR
(Note: your answer for the number of years should be a whole number, while your answer
for the number of days should be given to at least 3 decimal places.)
