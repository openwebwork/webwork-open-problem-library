Rhonda deposits \(A\) dollars in an account paying $ip1 percent
effective, and at the same time also deposits \(B\) dollars in
another account paying $ip2 percent effective.  After $n1 years 
have passed, the combined total in the two accounts is $b1 dollars.  In another
$m years, the balance in the account paying $ip2 percent effective
is three times that of the other account.  What is the balance in
the account paying $ip1 percent effective $n3 years after the initial deposit?
