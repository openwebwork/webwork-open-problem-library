TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Melissa deposits $a dollars in an account paying $ip percent interest
convertible monthly.  One year later, she withdraws $w dollars.  
If there are no other transactions, how long will it take (since her original deposit) 
for her account balance to reach $b dollars?  
(Assume simple interest between compoundings,
use the monthly interest rate in the simple interest formula, 
and assume that a month has 365/12 days.)
$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(10) \} months  and \{ &ans_rule(10) \} days.
$BR
(Note: your answer for the number of months should be a whole number, while your answer
for the number of days should be a decimal approximation.)
