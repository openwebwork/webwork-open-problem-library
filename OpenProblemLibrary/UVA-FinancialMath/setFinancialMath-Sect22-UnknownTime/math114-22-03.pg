Your cousin Ray borrows $a dollars now, repays $b dollars in two years,
and then borrows $c dollars in another three years, all at nominal
rates of interest of $ip percent convertible quarterly.
Your other cousin Jay borrows $d dollars \(t\) years from now at the same
interest rate.  If the
present value of both of your cousin's debts is the same, what is \(t\)?
(Assume compound interest at all times.)
