TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Two investments are made at the same time.  The first consists of
investing $b dollars at a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent
convertible semiannually.  The second consists of investing $a
dollars at a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent convertible
daily.  
How long will it take for the two investments to be
worth exactly the same amount?  (Assume compound interest at all times.)
