Irene plans to retire on January 1, 2020.  She has been preparing
to retire by making annual deposits, starting on January 1, 1980,
of $a dollars into an account that pays an effective rate of
interest of $ip percent.  She has continued this practice every
year through January 1, 2001.  Her goal is to have $b million dollars saved
up at the time of her retirement.  How large should her annual
deposits be (from January 1, 2002 until January 1, 2020) so that
she can reach her goal?
