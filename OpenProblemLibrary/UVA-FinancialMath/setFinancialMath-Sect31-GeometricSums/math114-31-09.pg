TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Bill invests $a dollars per year on the first day of the year,
with the first deposit coming on January 1, 1950.  The account
pays $ip1 percent effective interest.  Just prior to making his
January 1, 1960 deposit, Bill learns that he can begin to get $ip2
percent effective interest on his money if he increases his
deposits to $b dollars.  He does so, making the first deposit of
$b dollars on January 1, 1960, and the final deposit on January 1,
1980.  How much is in the account immediately after he makes the
final deposit?
