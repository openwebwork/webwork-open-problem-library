TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that you make a sequence of annual deposits (the first today) of
$d dollars into an account paying an effective rate of $ip percent.  If your
goal is to withdraw all the money the moment the balance reaches $s dollars,
and the account pays simple interest between compoundings, find the number of
years and days that must pass from the time of the first deposit until you
reach your goal.  (Note: your answer for the number of years should be a 
whole number, while your answer for the number of days should be a decimal approximation.)

Answer =  \{ans_rule(15) \} years and \{ans_rule(15) \} days.
