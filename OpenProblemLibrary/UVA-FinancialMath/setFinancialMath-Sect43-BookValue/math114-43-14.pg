TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A ${n}-year bond with a face value of 1000 dollars is redeemable at par, pays 
coupons at $ip percent per 6 months, and has a yield rate of $yp percent 
convertible semiannually. Suppose the book value immediately 
after the payment of the ${t}th coupon is equal to the price of a 
perpetuity (at the time of the ${t}th coupon) that will start making annual 
payments one year after the ${t}th coupon.
If the perpetuity earns interest at $kp percent effective,
how large is each perpetuity payment? 

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

$Bt = 1000*$i*(1 - (1+$y2)**(-2*$n + $t))/$y2 + 1000*(1+$y2)**(-2*$n + $t);
$ans = $Bt*$k;
