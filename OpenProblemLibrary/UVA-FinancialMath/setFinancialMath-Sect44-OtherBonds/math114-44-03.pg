TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A share of preferred stock pays dividends at a predetermined rate,
and so can be thought of as a bond that pays coupons forever and has
no redemption value.  Suppose that such a share of stock pays
semiannual dividends that increase by $jp percent with each dividend,
and the first dividend is $p dollars.  If the price of the stock is
$p2 dollars, what is the yield rate?  (Give your answer as the nominal
rate convertible semiannually.)

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} percent. $BR

EOT

$ans = ($p/$p2 + $j)*200;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol => .001) );
