TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

A ${n}-year bond pays coupons semiannually, the first coupon being for $c1 
dollars, and each coupon that follows is $jp percent more than the last. 
If the bond is redeemable at 2500 dollars and the yield rate is $yp percent 
convertible semiannually, what is the book value immediately after the 7th coupon is paid? 

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = $c1*((1+$j)**7)*$avp + 2500*(1+$y2)**(-2*$n+7);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f',tol=>.01) );
