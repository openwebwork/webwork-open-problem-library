A ${n}-year bond pays coupons semiannually, the first coupon being for $c1 
dollars, and each coupon that follows is $jp percent more than the last. 
If the bond is redeemable at 2500 dollars and the yield rate is $yp percent 
convertible semiannually, what is the book value immediately after the 7th coupon is paid? 

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
