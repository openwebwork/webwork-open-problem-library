TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that you purchase each of the following: for $pc dollars each 
two calls with a strike price of $spc dollars; for $pp dollars one 
put with a strike price of $spp dollars; and for $ps dollars a share of the stock.
Find the stock price at expiration that will result in the investment breaking even.
If there is more than one, give the larger price.  Then find (if it exists) 
the minimum possible profit for your investment on the expiration date.  If there is no minimum, 
then write "None" for your answer.  $BR

What is the largest stock price at the exercise date that will 
result in you breaking even? $BR 

Breakeven stock price = \{ &ans_rule(25) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = (2*$spc + 2*$pc +$pp + $ps)/3;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, tol=>0.01 ) );
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
What is the minimum profit possible on the exercise date?
$BR

Minimum Profit = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = -2*$pc - $pp + $spp - $ps;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, tol=>0, strings=>['None'] ) );
