TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Joan has borrowed $a dollars at a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent
convertible monthly.  She has agreed to repay the loan with 36 equal monthly
payments, the first coming one month after the loan is made.  After making
the 20th payment, she makes a deal with the lender where she'll pay off the
balance owed on the loan with 24 more monthly payments.
The lender agrees, provided that the yield rate on
the ENTIRE LOAN is $kp percent convertible monthly.  Under these new
terms, how much is her last payment?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT
