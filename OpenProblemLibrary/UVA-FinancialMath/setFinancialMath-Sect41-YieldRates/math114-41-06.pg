Norah borrows $a dollars from Zoie at a nominal rate of $ip percent convertible monthly, 
and agrees to make 20 equal monthly payments, the first coming in 9 months, to repay the
loan.  Immediately after Norah makes the 16th payment, Zoie sells the loan
to Kate.  If Kate's yield rate on the loan is $jp percent convertible monthly, 
how much did Kate pay Zoie for the loan?
