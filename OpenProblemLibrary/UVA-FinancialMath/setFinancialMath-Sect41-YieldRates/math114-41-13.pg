TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Schroeder borrows $a dollars from Peppermint Patty at an effective rate of $ip percent, and
agrees to make $n equal annual payments (the first one year later) to repay the
loan.  Immediately after she receives the 5th payment, Peppermint Patty sells the loan
to Franklin at a price that will provide Franklin with a yield of $jp percent effective.  
How much does Franklin pay for the loan?
