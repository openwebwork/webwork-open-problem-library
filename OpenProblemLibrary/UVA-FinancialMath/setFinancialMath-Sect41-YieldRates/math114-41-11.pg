TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose you take out a ${n}-year loan from C'ville Bank 
for $a dollars at an interest rate of $ip percent effective. 
To repay the loan, you agree to  
make equal annual payments, the first coming in one year.  After 
making the 10th payment, you decide to refinance your loan. 
In particular, you want to reduce your annual payment 
to 1500 dollars for each of the remaining $m payments, 
and then make a large final payment at the end of the 
original ${n}-year period to pay off the loan. (This 
payment will come immediately after the final 1500 dollar
loan payment.)  To save money for this large final payment, 
you plan to make equal annual deposits into an 
account at Richmond Bank earning $iep percent effective.
These deposits will occur at the same time as the 1500 dollar 
loan payments, i.e. 
the first deposit will be one year after you refinance the loan, and 
the last will be at the time of your final loan payment.  
C'ville Bank will agree to your plan, provided that 
their yield rate for the ENTIRE loan is $yp percent effective.
What will be the amount of each of the annual deposits to your 
account at Richmond Bank?
