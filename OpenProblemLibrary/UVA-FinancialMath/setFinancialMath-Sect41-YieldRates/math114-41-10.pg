TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Paolo borrows $a dollars from Anna at an effective rate of $ip percent, and
agrees to make $n equal annual payments (the first a year from now) to repay the
loan.  Immediately after Paolo makes the 11th payment, Anna sells the loan
to Carlo.  If Anna's total yield rate (on both the original loan and the sale to Carlo)
is $jp percent effective, how much does Carlo pay Anna for the loan?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = ($a - $paolopay*$a11)*(1+$j)**11;
ANS(num_cmp($ans) );
