TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Bonnie has borrowed $a dollars at a nominal rate of interest of $ip percent
convertible monthly.  She has agreed to repay the loan with 24 equal monthly
payments, the first coming one month after the loan is made.  After making
the 9th payment, she makes a deal with the lender where she'll pay off the
balance owed on the loan with 20 more monthly payments, each $jp percent
larger than the last.  The lender agrees, provided that the yield rate on
the remaining payments
is $kp percent convertible monthly.  Under these new terms, how much is her
last payment?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
