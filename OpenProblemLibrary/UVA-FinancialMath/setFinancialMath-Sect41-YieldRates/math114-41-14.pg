TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

All the Peanuts characters pool their money to buy an Old House.  They take out 
a $n year mortgage for $a dollars at a rate of interest of $ip percent
convertible monthly, agreeing to make equal monthly payments with the first due one month later.  
Immediately after making
the 20th payment, they decide to hire Bob Villa to remodel their house.  
To do this, they will need to refinance their loan and also borrow an additional 
100,000 dollars.  They make a deal with the lender where they will pay off the 
balance owed (on the original loan 
plus the additional 100,000 dollars) with $t more years of equal monthly payments.  The 
lender agrees, provided that its yield rate on the ENTIRE LOAN is 
$kp percent convertible monthly.  Under these new terms, what is their new monthly payment?
