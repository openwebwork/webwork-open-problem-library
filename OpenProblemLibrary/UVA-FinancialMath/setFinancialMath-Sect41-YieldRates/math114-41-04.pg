TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Larry borrows $a dollars from Moe at an effective rate of $ip percent, and
agrees to make 12 equal annual payments (the first a year from now) to repay the
loan.  Immediately after Larry makes the seventh payment, Moe sells the loan
to Curly.  If Moe's total yield rate 
is $jp percent effective, how much does Curly pay for the loan?

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

EOT

$ans = ($a - $larrypay*$a7)*(1+$j)**7;
ANS(num_cmp($ans, format => '%0.3f', tol=>.07) );
