Manny borrows $a dollars from Moe at an effective rate of $ip percent, and
agrees to make 10 equal annual payments (the first a year from now) to repay the
loan.  Immediately after Manny makes the third payment, Moe sells the loan
to Jack at a price that will provide Jack with a yield of $jp percent effective.  How
much does Jack pay for the loan?
