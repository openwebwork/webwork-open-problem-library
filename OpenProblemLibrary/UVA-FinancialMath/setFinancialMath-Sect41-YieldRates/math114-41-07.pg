TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Jess borrows $a dollars from Wes at a rate of $ip percent convertible semiannually, and
agrees to make $n equal annual payments (the first a year from now) to repay the
loan.  
Immediately after Jess makes the ${t}th payment, Wes sells the loan
to Su.  If Wes' total yield rate (on both the original loan and the sale to Su) 
is $yp percent effective, how
much does Su pay Wes for the loan?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
