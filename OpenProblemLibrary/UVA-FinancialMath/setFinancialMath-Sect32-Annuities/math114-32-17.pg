When my sister was born, my parents put $a dollars into an account earning $ip percent 
effective interest.  When I was born, my parents put $b dollars into the same account.  
Today is my birthday, and my sister is twice as old as I am.  Today the account balance 
is $PV dollars.  When I turn 21, my sister and I will be allowed to use the money in the 
account.  What will the account balance be then?  (Hint: First figure out how old I am.)

$BR
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(20) \} dollars.
