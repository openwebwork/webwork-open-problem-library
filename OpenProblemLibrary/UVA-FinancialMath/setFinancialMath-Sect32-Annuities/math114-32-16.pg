Kimberly has just started her first job and decides to begin saving
for a car.  She opens a savings account on October 1, 2003 with a deposit
of $a dollars, and will continue to make deposits of the same amount

will make the final deposit.  If the account pays a nominal rate of
interest of $ip percent convertible monthly, how much is in the
account on October 1, $y3, (when Kimberly will use this money as 
a down payment for a car)?
