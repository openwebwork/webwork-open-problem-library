TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Suppose that your grandparents give you $a dollars today as a graduation gift, and you deposit this money into an account that will earn an 
effective interest rate of $ip percent.  
You plan to make annual withdrawals from the account for as long as you 
can, with the first withdrawal being one year from now.  Each withdrawal will be $p dollars, except for the last one which will be a smaller amount. What will be the amount of this final smaller withdrawal?
