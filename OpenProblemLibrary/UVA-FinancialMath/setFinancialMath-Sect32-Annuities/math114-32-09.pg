# Present the text. 
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
An annuity will make 
payments as follows: starting on January 1, $y1 and ending on 
January 1, ${y2}, semiannual payments of $d1 dollars each are 
made.  Then, starting on January 1, $y3 and ending on January 1, 
${y4}, payments of $d2 dollars each are made once every two years.  If 
the current date is January 1, $y0 and the interest rate is $ip percent 
convertible semiannually, what is the present value of the annuity? 
$BR 
Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars.
