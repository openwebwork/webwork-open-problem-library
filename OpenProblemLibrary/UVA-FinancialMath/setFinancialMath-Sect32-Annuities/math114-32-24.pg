Suppose that an annuity will make monthly payments of $m dollars each, starting one month 
from now, followed by a final smaller payment (one month after the last regular payment).
If the present value of all the payments is $p dollars, and the annuity earns a rate of 
$ip percent convertible monthly, how many payments will you receive, including the 
final smaller payment?
