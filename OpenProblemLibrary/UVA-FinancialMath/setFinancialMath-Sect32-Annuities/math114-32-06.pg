TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Ralph wants to quit his job and move to Hawaii on December 25,
2015. Once there, he anticipates that he will need to make annual withdrawals
of $a dollars (starting on December 25, 2016) to supplement his income from
working as a cabana boy, and he wants the money to last 10 years (i.e. he'll make 
10 withdrawals total).
His plan is to make annual deposits, starting on December 25, 2000
and ending on December 25, 2015, into an account paying $ip
percent effective interest.  How large should each deposit be for
Ralph to realize his goal?
