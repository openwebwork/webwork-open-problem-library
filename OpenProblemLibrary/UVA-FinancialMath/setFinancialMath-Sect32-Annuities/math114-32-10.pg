Grandma Dayhoff has set up a trust fund for her grandson Donny 
that will make annual payments of $d dollars for $n years, 
starting on his 30th birthday.  Today is Donny's 21st birthday, 
and he meets with a tax expert and learns that the IRS will 
charge him a tax of $ip2 percent of the present value of all the 
trust fund payments on the day he receives the first payment. 
(The tax is due on the day he receives the first payment.)    To 
budget for the anticipated tax bill, Donny will make annual 
savings account deposits of \(X\) dollars, the first today and 
the last coming on his 30th birthday.  If his goal is to have 
exactly enough in the savings account to pay the tax bill, and we 
assume an effective rate of $ip percent throughout, how large 
should Donny's annual deposits be?

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars.
