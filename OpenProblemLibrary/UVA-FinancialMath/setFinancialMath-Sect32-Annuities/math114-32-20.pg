Richard Gere has decided to give up acting and devote his life to the study of Buddhism.  
In order to provide for his future, he is going to deposit $a dollars each month  
for the next two years into an account.  
Immediately after his last deposit, he will 
spend three years in a Tibetan monastery.  After leaving the monastery, he will 
begin making withdrawals from his account.  He will make $n equal annual withdrawals 
(that will deplete the account), 
the first coming on the day he leaves the monastery.  If his account earns 
an interest rate of $ip percent convertible monthly for the entire life of the account, 
what will be the amount of each 
withdrawal?
