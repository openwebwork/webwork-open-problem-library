You open a savings account on June 1, 2000, and decide to make annual
deposits of the form 
\($p1,$p2,$p1,$p2,\ldots\), the first coming on June 1, 2001.
You manage to keep this up - almost.  Instead of making your
regular deposit on June 1, 2013, you make a deposit of only $b dollars on that day. 
You are able to make all the rest of the deposits as originally planned.  
(Note: your deposit on June 1, 2014 will be $p2 dollars.)   
What is the balance in your account immediately after you make 
your deposit on June 1, 2033, assuming the account earns an effective
rate of interest of $ip percent throughout?
