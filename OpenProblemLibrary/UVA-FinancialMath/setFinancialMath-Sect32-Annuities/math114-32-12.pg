TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Grandma decides to put $P dollars every month into an account for you.  
She makes $n monthly deposits, the last coming 
September 1, 2003 - the day you start college.  She wants you to be able 
to withdraw money from this account at the beginning of each month, 
with the first withdrawal coming September 1, 2003 and
the last coming June 1, 2008, (when you'll graduate).  
(Note: that makes 58 withdrawals total.)
How much will you be able to withdraw each month if the account is earning 
a nominal interest rate of $ip percent convertible monthly?
