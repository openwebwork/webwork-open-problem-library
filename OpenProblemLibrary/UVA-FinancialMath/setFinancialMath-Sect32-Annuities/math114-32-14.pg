Suppose you have three annuities, each of which will begin making payments one year 
from now.  Annuity A will pay $P dollars every year.  
Annuity B will pay $Q dollars every year, for twice as long as Annuity A.  
Annuity C will pay $R dollars every year, for $n times as long as Annuity A.  
The present value of Annuity B is $jp percent greater than the present 
value of Annuity A.  If all three annuities will earn interest at the same rate,
what is the present value now of the final payment of Annuity C?
