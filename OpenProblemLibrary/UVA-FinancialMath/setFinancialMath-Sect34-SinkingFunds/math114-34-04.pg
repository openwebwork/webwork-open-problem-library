TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Nicole borrows $M dollars for 10 years at a nominal rate of $ip percent convertible 
monthly.  She has the option of paying off the loan using either the amortization or 
sinking fund method.  If the sinking fund has an interest rate of $jp percent 
convertible monthly, 
how much will she save each month by going with the better method?  
(Assume monthly payments and deposits.) 
(Note: you'll need to decide which method is the better one.)

$BR

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR

$ans = $amans - $sfans;
