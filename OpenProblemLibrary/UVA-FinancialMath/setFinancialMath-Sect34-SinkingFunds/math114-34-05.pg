TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Wanda takes out a ${n}-year mortgage 
for $a dollars at an interest rate 
of $ip percent effective. 
To repay the loan, she agrees to  
make equal monthly payments, the first coming in one month.  However, after 
making the 10th payment, she decides to refinance the mortgage. 
In particular, she decides to make $k more monthly payments (each of the same amount 
as before), and then she'll pay off the remainder of the loan with a large lump 
payment immediately after the last of these $k payments. 
To save money for this large final payment, 
she plans to make equal monthly deposits into an account paying $qp percent 
convertible monthly.  These deposits will occur at the same time as the monthly
loan payments, i.e. 
the first deposit will be one month after she refinances the loan, and 
the last will be at the time of the final loan payment. (So there are a total of $k deposits.)
What will be the amount of each of the monthly deposits?
