TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

Buck borrows $a dollars for $m years at a nominal rate of $ip percent convertible 
monthly.  He has the option of paying off the loan using either the amortization or 
sinking fund method.  If he can invest his sinking fund deposits at $jp percent 
convertible monthly, how much will he save each month by going with the better method?  
(Assume monthly payments and deposits.) 
(Note: you'll need to decide which method is the better one.)

Answer = \{ &ans_rule(30) \} dollars. $BR
