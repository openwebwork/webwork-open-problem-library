TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A commercial cherry grower estimates from past records that if $a
trees are planted per acre, each tree will yield $b pounds of
cherries for a growing season.  Each additional tree per acre
(up to 20) results in a decrease in yield per tree of 1 pound.
How many trees per acre should be planted to maximize yield per acre, and
what is the maximum yield?
$BR
Number of Trees = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$BR
Maximum Yield = \{ans_rule(10)\}
