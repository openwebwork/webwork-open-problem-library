TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A company manufacturers and sells \(x\) electric drills per month.
The monthly cost and price-demand equations are
\begin{align*}
C(x) &= $a + $b x,\\
p &= $c - \frac{x}{30}, \qquad 0 \leq x\leq 5000.
\end{align*}
(A) Find the production level that results in the maximum revenue.
$BR
Production Level = \{ans_rule(10)\}

(B) Find the price that the company should charge for each drill
in order to maximize profit.

(C) Suppose that a 5 dollar per drill tax is imposed.  Determine the number
of drills that should be produced and sold in order to maximize
profit under these new circumstances.
