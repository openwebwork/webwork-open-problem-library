A boat is pulled into a dock by a rope attached to the bow
of the boat and passing through a pulley on the dock that is
1 m higher than the bow of the boat.
$PAR
If the rope is pulled in at a rate of $a m/s, how fast is
the boat approaching the dock when it is $b m from the dock?
$PAR
Rate = \{ ans_rule(20) \} m/s
$PAR
