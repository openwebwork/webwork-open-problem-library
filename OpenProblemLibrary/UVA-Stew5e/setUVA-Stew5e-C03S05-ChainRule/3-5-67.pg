The motion of a spring that is subject to a frictional force or a damping force (such as a shock absorber on a car) is often modeled by the product of an exponential function and a sine or cosine function.  Suppose the equation of motion of a point on such a spring is 
\[ s(t) = $a e^{-$k t}\sin(2 \pi t) \]
where \( s \) is measured in centimeters and \( t \) is measured in seconds.  Find the velocity of the point after \( t \) seconds.
