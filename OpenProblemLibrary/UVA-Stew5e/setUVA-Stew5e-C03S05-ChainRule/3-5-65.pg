A Cepheid variable star is a star whose brightness alternately increases and decreases.  Suppose that Cephei Joe is a star for which the interval between times of maximum brightness is $p days.  Its average brightness is $k and the brightness changes by +/-$a.  Using this data, we can construct a mathematical model for the brightness of Cephei Joe at time \( t \), where \( t \) is measured in days:
\[ B(t) = $k + $a\sin(2 \pi t/$p) \]
(a) Find the rate of change of the brightness after \( t \) days.
