BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the problem \( u_t = u_{xx} \), \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( t > 0 \),
with boundary condition \( u(0,t) = 0 , u(1,t) =  \cos($a t) \), and initial condition \( u(x,0) = x \).
$BR
$BR
Solve in two steps.  First transform the problem into a problem with homogeneous boundary conditions, but
inhomogeneous PDE, and then solve.
Write \( u = S + U \), where \( S(x,t) = A(t) (1-x) + B(t) x \) is (affine) linear in \(x\),
that is
$BR
\( S(x,t) = {} \)
\{ ans_rule(40) \}
$BR
$BR
The initial boundary value problem for \( U \) becomes
$BR
PDE: \( U_t = U_{xx} + f(x,t) \)
$BR
where \( f(x,t) = {} \)
\{ ans_rule(40) \}
$BR
BC: \( U(0,t) = 0, U(1,t) = 0 \)
$BR
IC: \( U(x,0) = {} \) \{ ans_rule(40) \}
$BR
$BR
Now solve for \(U\).
$BR
$BR
The eigenfunctions to use are
$BR
\( X_n(x) = {} \) \{ ans_rule(40) \}
$BR
First decompose the inhomogeneity in the PDE as
$BR
\( \displaystyle f(x,t) = \sum_{j=1}^n f_n(t) X_n(x) \) ,
$BR
where
\( f_n(t) = {} \) \{ ans_rule(40) \}
$BR
You find that
$BR
\( \displaystyle U(x,t) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty T_n(t) X_n(x) \) ,
$BR
where
$BR
\( T_n = {} \)
\( \displaystyle \int_0^t \)
\{ ans_rule(60) \} \( ds \)
$BR
$BR
Then \( u(x,t) = S(x,t) + U(x,t) \)
$BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
${PAR}SOLUTION:$PAR

The \(S\) needs to make \(U\) into one with homogeneous
boundary conditions, so \( S(x,t) = $answer1 \) will work.
$BR
$BR
Notice that \(S_{xx} = 0\), so \(u_{xx} = U_{xx}\).
If \(u = U + S \) and \( u_t = u_{xx} \), then
$BR
\(U_{xx} = u_{xx} = u_t = U_t + S_t = U_t - $answer2 .  \)
$BR
Or in other words \(f(x,t) = $answer2 \).
$BR
$BR
As \(U(x,t) = u(x,t)-S(x,t) = u(x,t) - $answer1 \).  Setting
\(t=0\) we find
\(U(x,0) = u(x,0)-x = 0 \).
$BR
$BR
The eigenvalue problem we need to use is the one that comes up
with the sine series as we have Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Therefore \( X_n(x) = $answer4 \) .
$BR
$BR
Computing the coefficient
$BR
\(\displaystyle
f_n(t) = 2 \int_0^1 f(x,t) \sin(n \pi x) \, dx =
$answer5 .
\)
Finally, by plugging the series into the equation for \(U\) and equating coefficients, we find that
\(T_n\) satisfies \( T_n' + (n\pi)^2 T_n = f_n(t) \), and
\(T_n(0) = 0 \).  Using
integrating factor we find
$BR
\( T_n(t) = {} \)
\( \displaystyle \int_0^t $answer6 \, ds \) .
