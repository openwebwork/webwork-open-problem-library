Consider the system of differential equations 
\[ \begin{array}{rcl} 
\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} & = & $m11 x + $m12 y, \cr 
			    &   & 		  \cr
\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} & = & $m21 x + $m22 y. 
\end{array} \] 	 
For this system, the smaller eigenvalue is  \{ans_rule(30)\} and the larger eigenvalue is  \{ans_rule(30)\}.
