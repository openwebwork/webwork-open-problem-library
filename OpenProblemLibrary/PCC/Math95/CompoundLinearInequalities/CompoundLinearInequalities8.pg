BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

###Question 1

It's given that dry air cools at a rate of about [`1^{\circ}\text{C}`]  for every [`100\,\text{m}`] rise. The problem uses the unit [`\text{km}`] everywhere else, so we need to do:

    [`` 100\,\text{m}=0.1\,\text{km}, ``]
    
since [`1\,\text{km}=1,000\,\text{m}`].

Since dry air cools at a rate of about [`1^{\circ}\text{C}`]  for every [`0.1\,\text{km}`] rise, the rate is [`10^{\circ}\text{C}`] for every [`1\,\text{km}`] rise.

The rate of change is constant, implying a linear function [`T(x)=mx+b`]. Since temperature decreases, [`m=-10 \frac{^{\circ}\text{C}}{\text{km}}`]. The starting temperature (ground temperature) is given as [`[$a]^{\circ}\text{C}`], we have [`b=[$a]`]. As a result, the function to model the temperature at height [`x\,\text{km}`] is

    [``T(x)=[$ans1].``]

###Question 2

The ground temperature is given as [`[$a]^{\circ}\text{C}`], which is the maximum temperature the plane will encounter. As the plane rises to [`[$b]\,\text{km}`], the temperature decreases to

    [``T([$b]) = [$a]-10([$b]) = [$low]^{\circ}\text{C}``]

The range of temperature a plane is exposed to if it takes off and reaches a maximum height of [`[$b]\,\text{km}`] is [`[$ans2]`] in [`^{\circ}\text{C}`].
