BEGIN_PGML
Simplify this expression, and if applicable, write the restricted domain.  [@KeyboardInstructions("The problem accepts many ways to format the answers here, but one way is like typing [|x^2 for x!=1 and x!=2|]* where [|!=|]* is how to type the [`\\neq`] symbol.")@]**


    [``[$f1] \div [$f2]={}``][__________________________________]{$ans}

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$f1] \div [$f2] 
      &= \frac{[$f1num1]}{[$f1den1]} \div \frac{[$f2num1]}{[$f2den1]} \\
      &= \frac{[$f1num1]}{[$f1den1]} \cdot \frac{[$f2den1]}{[$f2num1]} \\
      &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}

Since the factors [`x+[$a]`] and [`x+[$b]`] were canceled, [`x \ne [$aN]`] and [`x \ne [$bN]`] are lost domain conditions.

Note that [`x+[$c]`] used to be in the denominator, but not any more in the solution. This is why [`x \ne [$cN]`] is also a lost domain condition.
