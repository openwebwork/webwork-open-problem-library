BEGIN_PGML  
You are offered two different sales jobs.  The first company offers a straight commission of [`[$p2]%`] of the sales.  The second company offers a salary of [`\$[$a]`] per week _plus_ [`[$p1]%`] of the sales.  How much would you have to sell in a week in order for the straight commission offer to be at least as good?

You'd have to sell more than [________]{$ans} worth of goods for the straight commission to be better for you. In other words, the dollar amount of goods sold would have to be in the interval [__________]{Interval("($ansReal,inf)")}. [@KeyboardInstructions('(Answer using interval notation.)')@]*
