# This is a good place to issue instructions or give comments
# that are specific for this problem set.  You might need some
# WeBWorK formatting commands though.  Here is a fairly complete
# list:
#
#  $BR                           line break
#  $PAR                          paragraph break
#  $BBOLD and $EBOLD             begin and end boldface
#  $BITALIC and $EITALIC         begin and end italics
#  $BUL and $EUL                 begin and end underline
#  $BCENTER and $ECENTER         begin and end centering
#  $HR                           make a horizontal rule (line)
#  
#  $SPACE                        force a space where one isn't 
#                                automatically created
#
# Some characters should not be literally typed, since they have
# control functions in Perl or produce different characters in LaTeX.
# Also, the character might not even be a keyboard character.  Using
# them will either cause erroneous text in WeBWorK or in the printed
# hardcopy version of an assignment.  If you need to use these 
# characters, here are their commands:
#
#  $CARET              ^         a caret 
#  $PERCENT            %         percent sign
#  $DOLLAR             $         dollar sign
#  $US                 _         underscore
#  $LQ                           left double quote
#  $RQ                           right double quote
#
#  These two require special attention.  For the set header, use:
#  $GTS                >         greater than sign
#  $LTS                <         less than sign              
#  But for the hardcopy header, use:
#  \textgreater        >         greater than sign
#  \textless           <         less than sign
#
#  And these two require special attention.  For the set header, 
#  type them as is 
#  {                   {         left brace
#  }                   }         right brace
#  But for the hardcopy header, use:
#  $LBRACE             {         left brace
#  $RBRACE             }         right brace
# 
# 
# Also, here are some basic LaTeX commands that will probably 
# come in handy.  All LaTeX needs to be encased in \( and \).  
# (Or you can encase them in \[ and \] for display math mode.)
#
#  \frac{a}{b}                   to make a fraction
#  \pi                           pi
#  \geq                          greater than or equal to 
#  \leq                          less than or equal to 
#  \sin, \cos, \ln               nicely typeset function names
#  \{, \}                        braces in math mode
#  \left(                        if you write a grouping symbol
#  \left[                          this way, it will be large enough
#  \left\{                         to encase whatever comes between
#                                  it and the corresponding \right)
#                                                           \right]
#                                                           \right\}

BEGIN_TEXT

The primary purpose of WeBWorK is to let you know that you are getting the 
correct answer or to alert you if you are making some kind of mistake. Usually 
you can attempt a problem multiple times before the due date and try to learn from your mistakes.  If you are having trouble with a problem, you should consult the book or your notes, or ask a fellow student, a tutor, or your professor for help.  Don't spend a lot of time guessing - it's not very efficient or effective.

$PAR

Give 4 or 5  significant digits for decimal answers.  However, sometimes a 
problem will require you to give an exact answer, and a decimal approximation 
will be counted as wrong.

$PAR

If you get a problem wrong, always read the feedback message if there is one.  WeBWorK tries to let you know what format it is expecting.  It also tries to let you know how your math might be wrong.

$PAR

Here's the list of 
\{ htmlLink(qq!http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Available_Functions!,"functions and symbols") \}
 that WeBWorK understands.

$PAR
Most of the time if WeBWorK is telling you that your answer is incorrect, your 
answer is actually incorrect.   This is a good thing - it gives 
you a chance to learn.  Read the error message if WeBWorK makes one for you.  
This may help you find your mistake.   Otherwise, you have the opportunity to 
ask your instructor for help.
$PAR
You can use the Email instructor button on each problem
page to send e-mail to the instructor.
