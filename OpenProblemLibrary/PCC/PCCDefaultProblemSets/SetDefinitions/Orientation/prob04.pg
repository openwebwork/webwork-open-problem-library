Title("Rules of Precedence");

##############################################

BEGIN_TEXT

The rules of precedence determine the order in which the mathematical
operations are performed by $WW. It is essential for you to understand
these so that you know how $WW interprets what you type in.  If there
are no parentheses and no functions (such as \{computer "sin"\} or
\{computer "log"\}), then $WW computes the value of your answer by
dealing with exponents first, followed by multiplication and division
(from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction
(from left to right).
$PAR

If there are expressions in grouping symbols, those expressions are
simplified first.  We'll talk about functions (and give a more
complete list of rules) in a later problem.

$PAR
Examples:
\{BeginList("UL")\}
$ITEM
\{student "4*3/6 = 12/6 = 2"\} (multiplications and divisions are done
from left to right)
$ITEM 
\{student "4*3/6-2*7+10 = 2 - 14 + 10 = -2"\} (multiplications and divisions are done
before additions and subtractions)
$ITEM
\{student "12/3/2 = 4/2 = 2"\} (multiplications and divisions are done
from left to right)
$ITEM
\{student "12/(3/2) = 12/1.5 = 8"\}
(expressions inside parentheses are calculated before anything else)
$ITEM
\{student "2*4${CARET}2 = 2*16 = 32"\} (exponentiation is done before multiplication),
so \{student "2*4${CARET}2 - 3*4 = 2*16 - 3*4 = 32 - 12 = 20"\}.
\{EndList("UL")\}
$PAR

To practice these rules, completely simplify the following
expressions. Because the point of this problem is for you to do the
numerical calculations correctly, $WW will only accept sufficiently 
accurate decimal numbers or fractions as the answers to these problems.
