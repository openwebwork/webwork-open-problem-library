The following questions practice how to enter units in WeBWorK. Enter a number with a unit as your answer. Note that if a unit is already shown after the textbox, there is no need to enter the unit again.

For finance related units, enter the dollar sign, followed by the money amount.

For non-finance related units, enter the number first, followed by a space, and then followed by the unit.

    *Finance*  
    [@numberWord($finance1)@] dollars

    [_________]{$financeans1}

    [@numberWord($finance2_dollar)@] dollars and [@numberWord($finance2_cent)@] cents

    [_________]{$financeans2}

    *Length*  
    A rectangle's base is [@numberWord($length)@] feet long (WeBWorK recognizes *ft* as the unit feet).

    [_________]{$lengthans}

    *Area*  
    A rectangle's area is [@numberWord($area)@] square meters (WeBWorK recognizes *m^2* as the unit square meter).

    [_________]{$areaans}

    *Physics*  
    A car is accelerating at [@numberWord($acceleration)@] feet per second squared.

    [_________]{$acceleration} [` \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2} `]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Here are the solutions:

    *Finance*  
    [@numberWord($finance1)@] dollars

    [`[$financeans1]`]

    [@numberWord($finance2_dollar)@] dollars and [@numberWord($finance2_cent)@] cents

    [`[$financeans2]`]

    *Length*  
    A rectangle's base is [@numberWord($length)@] feet long (WeBWorK recognizes *ft* as the unit feet).

    [`[$lengthans]`]

    *Area*  
    A rectangle's area is [@numberWord($area)@] square meters (WeBWorK recognizes *m^2* as the unit square meter).

    [`[$area] \text{ m^2}`]

    *Physics*  
    A car is accelerating at [@numberWord($acceleration)@] feet per second squared.

    [`[$acceleration]`] [` \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2} `]

Note that there is no need to enter unit for the last problem, as the unit is already there.
