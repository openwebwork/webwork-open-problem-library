## Navigating WeBWorK ##

[@ if($envir{QUIZ_PREFIX}) {'*Important:* This page is informational only and features described applies mostly to homework (not used in this course) rather than quizzes.'} @]**

That's enough for now about how you enter your answers. Let's spend some time learning how to navigate WeBWorK so that you can use it more effectively.

By now you've had experience with the _Next_ button above. The _Previous_ button takes you to the previous problem, and the _Problem List_ button takes you back to the beginning of this problem set.

At the bottom of a problem screen, you may see how many times you have attempted a problem, and how many times you have left. Sometimes you also see whether or not partial credit is possible, and if so how much do you have. This particular problem is lying about how many attempts you have used. How many attempts does it _say_ that you have used so far? [______]{Compute($a)} 

On the left of the screen there are three panels. The middle panel is just a quick way for you to jump to other problems in the problem set. The top panel lets you find your way to 
* *Homework Sets*: this is the screen you were at when you first logged in. It shows you all of the homework sets that have been assigned to you and when they are due.
* *User Settings*:  
    * If you would like to change your password, go here.  
    * You may also change your contact email to something that you find more convenient here. However the law requires that your instructor is only permitted to communicate with you about grades using your official school email address. So we recommend that you leave your email address alone. Check your school email address often.  
    * There are some other settings that you can save for your account.
* *Grades*: Go here to see how you have performed in your assignments.
* *Achievements*: If your instructor is using Math Achievements, then you can earn badges and level up as you complete homework problems. Go here to view your level and badges. Also, if you have earned any items that can be applied to your homework sets, you will see them here.

Also in *User Settings*, you may choose either to see or not see your previously entered answers, and choose whether or not to enable the math editing tool (this is only an option if the instructor has turned on that tool in the first place).

When you are ready, move on to the next problem.
