#The simplest functions are the ${BITALIC}linear$EITALIC ones ---
#the functions whose graphs are straight lines.  They are important
#because many functions locally look like straight lines.  (Looking
#like a line ${BITALIC}locally$EITALIC means that if we zoom in on the
#function and look at it at a very powerful magnification, it will look
#like a straight line.)

BEGIN_TEXT

As with the previous matching problems, you will not be told which of
your answers are correct when you submit your answers to this problem.
$WW will only tell you if ${BITALIC}all${EITALIC} your answers are
correct or not.
$PAR

Some $WW problems display a link to additional information or a
\{htmlLink($hintURL,"hint")\}.  Follow this link for a hint about
graphs in $WW.

#Occasionally, a problem includes a hint that will not be available
#immediately.  Once you have submitted incorrect answers a certain
#number of times (determined by the problem), you will see a ${LQ}Show
#Hint$RQ button above the submit buttons at the bottom of the screen.
#Check the box and press ${LQ}Submit$RQ in order to get the hint.  For
#this problem, the hint will be available after one wrong answer.
