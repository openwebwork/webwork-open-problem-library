Title("Non-Numeric Answers");

##############################################

BEGIN_TEXT

Sometimes you will be asked to enter answers that are not numbers.
For example, if you are asked to determine what is \(\frac{1}{0}\), the answer is that this $LQ\(\)number$RQ does not exist, so you might have to type \{student "DNE"\} to indicate this (the problem should tell you what words to
use).  Note that upper- and lower-case letters are not the same to
$WW, so you might need to enter the answer exactly as indicated in the
problem.  (Well-written problems will allow the answer to be
entered either way.)
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
Please enter ${LQ}\{student "DNE"\}${RQ} here: \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$EBLOCKQUOTE

END_TEXT

ANS(String('DNE')->cmp);

##################################################

BEGIN_TEXT

Other problems may require you to enter \(\infty\), which you do using
the word ${LQ}\{student "INFINITY"\}${RQ} (in upper- or lower-case) or
${LQ}\{student "INF"\}${RQ} for short.  The problem should remind you
of how to do this.  You can't add or multiply something by infinity.  You
can, however, indicate \(-\infty\) by ${LQ}\{student "-INFINITY"\}${RQ},
or ${LQ}\{student "-INF"\}${RQ}.
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
Try entering \(-\infty\) here: \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$EBLOCKQUOTE

END_TEXT

ANS((-(Infinity))->cmp);

##################################################

Context("Interval");

$a = random(-5,5,1);
$I = Compute("(-infinity,$a)");

BEGIN_TEXT

One common place where you use \(\infty\) is as an endpoint of
an interval.  $WW allows you to enter intervals using standard
interval notation, including infinite endpoints.  For example,
\{student "[-2,5)"\} represents an interval that is closed on the
left and open on the right, while \{student "[2,inf)"\} is an interval
that extends infinitely to the right.
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
If you have learned interval notation, write the interval of points that are less than \($a\): \{ans_rule(20)\}.
$EBLOCKQUOTE

END_TEXT

ANS($I->cmp);

##################################################

Context("Interval");

$a = random(-8,-2,1);
$b = random($a+1,$a+5,1);
$c = random($b+1,$b+5,1);
$I = Compute("[$a,$b) U ($b,$c)");

${BCENTER} ${BBOLD} If you are in a math course numbered 70 or below, you might not need the information on the rest of this page. Feel free to move on to the next page.${EBOLD} ${ECENTER}
$PAR
Several intervals can be combined into one region using the ${LQ}set
union${RQ} operation, \(\cup\), which is represented as ${LQ}\{student
"U"\}${RQ} in $WW.  For example, \{student "[-2,0] U (8,inf)"\}
represents the points from \(-2\) to \(0\) together with everything
bigger than 8.
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
Write the set of points from \($a\) to \($c\) but excluding \($b\) and \($c\)
as a union of intervals: \{ans_rule(20)\}.
