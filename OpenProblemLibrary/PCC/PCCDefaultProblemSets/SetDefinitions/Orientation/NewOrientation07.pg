## Seeking Help ##

The primary purpose of WeBWorK is that it allows you to practice some math problems and immediately get feedback about your answers. This is much better than waiting a full week to learn about your answers from written homework. WeBWorK will even often give you _intelligent_ feedback if you are reading the feedback messages.

If you become stuck on a problem, cannot get the answer correct, do not understand what the problem asks, think there is a bug with the problem, or all of the above, then...
1. Check that you have read any feedback messages WeBWorK is giving, and that you have not rounded your answer too much.
2. Reread the problem carefully to see if there are any instructions that you did not notice. 
3. Check your textbook and notes to see if you can learn from them.
4. There is an *Email Instructor* button below: use it.

When you use this button, you should write a message to your instructor (or TA) explaining what you have tried. It will help a lot if you write down the steps of the math that you have worked out too. You can even attach a file, for example a picture of your hand-written work. Then the instructor gets your message along with a link to the problem from _your perspective_, and they can also see all of your previously attempted answers. This way your instructor can write you back with good help/hints.

Writing for help is OK! Yes, it is last on this list, but that is just because it is good for you to try to be self sufficient. There is a lot you can gain from WeBWorK's feedback, your textbook, and your notes. If you feel it is appropriate to contact your instructor for help, then do so!

This answer blank is expecting a certain answer: [___________]{Real(112358)->cmp(tolType=>'absolute',tolerance=>0.1)}. The only way to get the answer is to use the *Email Instructor* button and politely ask for the answer to this Orientation Problem. The instructor will reply to your email as soon as they are able to, which may be the following day. (Instructors: you can check the box to show "Correct Answers" and then use the "Check" button to see the answer and write a response to your student.)

If you don't get a reply within 12 hours, please check your SPAM folder. Google mail will sometimes direct WeBWorK emails to SPAM. This only happens to about 1 in 30 people, but it does happen. If this happens to you just click the option telling Google mail that email from that sender is not SPAM and you should be good for the rest of the term. If you do not find anything in your SPAM folder either, contact your instructor with email outside of WeBWorK.
