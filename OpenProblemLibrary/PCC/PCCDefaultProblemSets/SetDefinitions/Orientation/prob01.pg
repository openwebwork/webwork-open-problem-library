Title("Understanding $WW Problem Pages");

##############################################
BEGIN_TEXT

The $WW screen is divided into several areas, each used for a
different purpose.  You will need to understand these
in order to use $WW effectively.
$PAR

At the upper left are the navigation buttons that allow you to move
from problem to problem.  The ${LQ}Next$RQ and ${LQ}Previous$RQ
buttons, naturally, send you to the next and previous problems.  The
${LQ}Prob. List$RQ button takes you back to the opening
page for the homework set (the one that lists all the problems and
gives the instructions for the homework set).
$PAR

The area below the navigation buttons is where $WW tells you about
your score for the current problem.  (It will be shown on a grey
backgound to help make it stand out; you will see this later.) When you have submitted your answers, this is where you will be given information about what
answers you got right and wrong.  This area also shows you how many points a problem is worth.
$PAR

The main part of the page is the text of the problem you are trying to
answer, including blank boxes for you to enter your answers. $BR For example,  2 + 2 = $SPACE \{ans_rule(2)\}
$PAR

Below the large white text area that you are reading right now is a message area where you may be informed about how partial credit is handled in multi-part problems.  Other information might also appear there, such as a message that the due date is passed or that answers are available.
$PAR

In the panel at the left, instead of the list of homework sets, you
now have a list of the problems within this assignment.  You can go to
any problem just by clicking on it.  The checkboxes at the bottom of
the panel are discussed in the next problem.
$PAR

The buttons at the bottom of the screen, including the ${LQ}Submit
Answers$RQ button, are discussed in the next problem. At this point,
you can get credit for Problem 1 by typing $BBOLD 4$EBOLD into the answer box above, and pressing the ${LQ}Submit Answers$RQ button at the bottom of the page, and then pressing the ${LQ}Next$RQ button at the
top of the screen to go on to the next problem.
