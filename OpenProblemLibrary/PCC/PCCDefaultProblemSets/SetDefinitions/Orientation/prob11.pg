Sometimes you might be asked to provide more than one answer in a single
answer blank.  In this case, you should separate your answers by commas.  Such an answer is called a ${BITALIC}list${EITALIC} in $WW.  Note that you don't $BITALIC have to $EITALIC enter multiple answers for a list; a single number is a legal response (it's a list with only one thing).
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
The even integers between 1 and 9 are: \{ans_rule(20)\}. $BR
Try entering the answer in a different order.  With lists, order won't matter.

$a = random(1,5,1);
$f = Formula("1/(x^2+$a^2)")->reduce;

When you are asked for a list of numbers, another possible answer is
that there are ${BITALIC}no${EITALIC} numbers that satisfy the
requirements.  In that case, you should enter ${LQ}\{student
"NONE"\}${RQ} as your answer.
$PAR

$BBLOCKQUOTE
The expression \($f\) is not defined at these \(x\) values: \{ans_rule(20)\}.
