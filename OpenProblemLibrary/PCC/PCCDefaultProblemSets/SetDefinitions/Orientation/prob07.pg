BEGIN_TEXT

$WW knows the value of \(\pi\), which you can enter as \{student
"pi"\}, and the value of \(e\) (the base of the natural logarithm,
\(e\approx 2.71828\)), which you can enter simply as the letter
\{student "e"\}. This answer blank is expecting the area formula for a circle, which is \(\pi r^2\).  Try it: $SPACE \(A=\) \{ans_rule(8) \}.
END_TEXT
Context()->variables->add(r=>'Real');
ANS(Compute("pi r^2")->cmp);

$PAR


$WW also understands many standard functions, like square root.  Here
is a partial list. Notice that function names use lower-case
letters.  Capitalizing might lead to an error message.

\{BeginParList("UL")\}

$ITEM
The square root \(\sqrt{\ } \) is represented by \{student
"sqrt(x)"\}.  Try entering the square root of seven:  \{ans_rule(10) \}.
END_TEXT
ANS(Compute("sqrt(7)")->cmp);

$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
$WW knows about \{student "sin(x)"\}, \{student "cos(x)"\}, \{student
"tan(x)"\}, \{student "arcsin(x)"\}, \{student "arccos(x)"\},
\{student "arctan(x)"\} and the other trigonometric functions and their
inverses.  $WW ${BITALIC}always$EITALIC uses radian mode for these
functions.  $WW will evaluate trigonometric functions for you in many situations.  For example, the following blank is expecting the value \(-1\).
Since \(\cos(\pi) = -1\), you can enter \{student "cos(pi)"\}.  Try it: \{ans_rule(10)\} \(= -1\)

$ITEM
The function \{student "ln(x)"\} means the natural logarithm of \(x\) (the logarithm with base \(e\)).  In $WW, \{student "log(x)"\} $BITALIC also$EITALIC means the natural logarithm.  Use \{student "log10(x)"\} for the base 10
logarithm of \(x\).
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
The exponential function with base \(e\) can be entered as
\{student "e${CARET}x"\} or \{student "exp(x)"\}.  The second method
is convenient if you have a long, complicated exponent.
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
The absolute value function, \(|x|\), should be entered as
\{student "|x|"\} or \{student "abs(x)"\}.
$ITEMSEP

$ITEM
The inverse sine function, \(\sin${CARET}{-1}(x)\), can be written as
\{student "arcsin(x)"\} or \{student "asin(x)"\} or \{student "sin${CARET}(-1)(x)"\}
in $WW.  Note that this is ${BITALIC}not$EITALIC the same as
\{student "(sin(x))${CARET}(-1)"\}, which means \(\frac{1}{\sin(x)}\).
The other inverse functions are handled similarly.
