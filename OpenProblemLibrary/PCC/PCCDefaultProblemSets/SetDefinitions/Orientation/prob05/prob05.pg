BEGIN_TEXT

Many of the answers you enter into $WW will be expressions
that involve variables.  Here are some important things to know.

$PAR

\{BeginParList("UL")\}

$ITEM
It matters what letter you use.  For example, if you are asked for a
function using the variable \(x\), then it won't work to enter the
function with the variable \(t\). Also, $WW considers upper- and
lower-case letters to be different, so don't use the capital letter
\(X\) in place of the lower-case letter \( x\). 
The following blank is expecting the
expression \(x^3\), which you would enter as \{student "x${CARET}3"\} or
\{student "x**3"\}.  Instead, try entering \{student "t${CARET}3"\} or \{student "X${CARET}3"\} and submitting your answer, just to see what happens.

$PAR
$BBLOCKQUOTE
\{ans_rule(10)\}
$EBLOCKQUOTE
$PAR

You should get an error message informing you that \{computer "t"\}
is not defined in this context.  This tells you that $WW did not receive the
correct variable and doesn't know how to check your answer.  Now enter
\{student "x${CARET}3"\} and resubmit to get credit for this part of
the problem.

END_TEXT

ANS(Formula("x^3")->cmp);

$IMGA = MathIMG("prob05-a.gif","1/x+1","1/x+1");
$IMGB = MathIMG("prob05-b.gif","1/(x+1)","\frac{1}{x+1}");
$IMGC = MathIMG("prob05-c.gif","(1/x)+1","\frac{1}{x} + 1");

BEGIN_TEXT

$ITEM
$WW requires that you think about how you present your answer.  As we just saw, you need to be careful about the variables that you use.  You must also be careful about how the order of operations apply to your answers.  Often, this involves using parentheses appropriately.

$PAR

For example, you might intend to submit $IMGB, and write $IMGA on your paper. But that is actually incorrect.  The expression $IMGA means $IMGC,
according to the rules of precedence.  $WW will force you to be exact
with how you think and what you write.  If you want
to enter something that means $IMGB, you must write \{student
"1/(x+1)"\}. 

$PAR

This precision is important in your written work too.  If the answer was $IMGB and you wrote $IMGA on paper or on a test, it is not correct.  So the precision that $WW is demanding of you will help you outside of $WW.
