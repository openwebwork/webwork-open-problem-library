This folder contains collections of problems developed at Portland Communit College. PCC maintains a separate repository of these problems on its WeBWorK server. Faculty at PCC work to improve and add to these libraries, and the results are periodically copied from the PCC server to this place within webwork-open-problem-library.

These problems all have coded walkthrough solutions, use MathObjects where possible, attempt to get the most out of using MathObjects, use randomization, and have accessibility considerations such as alt tags for pictures and appropriate table structures. 

These problems use several custom macros that are kept in OpenProblemLibrary/macros/PCC/.

Currently the only github user who should be allowed to change files here is Alex-Jordan or cmhughes.
