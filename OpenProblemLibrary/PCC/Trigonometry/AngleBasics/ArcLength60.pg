BEGIN_PGML

A person walked [`[$arc]`] miles along the bank of a circular lake. If the radius of the lake is [`[$radius]`] miles, what's the angle, in degrees, of the person's final position relative to his starting position?

    Angle (in degree) = [____________]{$degree} degrees

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The person walked [`[$arc]`] miles along the circular bank. This is the arc length of the arc of the circle. The lake's radius is also given as [`[$raidus]`] miles.

The arc length, [`s`], corresponding to an angle of [`\theta`] radians in a circle of radius [`r`] is [`s = r \cdot \theta `]. Note that we have to change radian to degree by multiplying [`\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}`].

Here is how to calculate the angle:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  s &= r \cdot \theta \\
  \theta &= \frac{s}{r} \\
    &= \frac{[$arc]}{[$radius]} \\
    &\approx [$radian] \text{ radians} \\
    &= [$radian] \cdot \frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi} \\
    &\approx [$degree]^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
Thus the angle's measure is [`[$degree]^{\circ}`].
