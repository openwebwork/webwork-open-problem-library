BEGIN_PGML

A spherical weather balloon is being inflated.  With a beginning radius of [`[$bu]`], the radius of the balloon increases at the rate of [`[$au]`].  Express the surface area of the balloon as a function of time [`t`] (in seconds). If needed you can enter
[` \pi `] as *pi*. (Hint: The surface area of a sphere of radius [`r`] is [`4 \pi r^2`].)

    [`S(t) = {}`][__________________]{$ans1}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We have been given the formula for the surface area as a function of the radius:

    [`S(r) = 4\pi r^2`]

And we have been given some information about how the radius of the balloon is changing over time. It starts at [`[$bu]`] and then grows at a constant rate of [`[$au]`]. This is precisely what it means for [`r`] to be a linear function of time with [`y`]-intercept [`[$b]`] and slope [`[$a]`]. So if [`t`] is measured in seconds, we have that:

    [`r(t) = [$r]`]

and now we can substitute this in to our formula for [`S`]. Since we will be left with an expression in [`t`], we can write our new formula using function notation with [`S`] depending on [`t`].

    [`S(t) = [$ans1]`]
