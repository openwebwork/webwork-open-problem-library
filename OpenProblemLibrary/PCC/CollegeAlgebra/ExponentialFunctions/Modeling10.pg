$initial = random(6,8,0.1);

$growthRate = random(0.9,2.9,0.2);

$growthFactor = 1-$growthRate/100;

$answer = Formula("P(t)=$initial($growthFactor)^t");

BEGIN_PGML

In 2010, the population of a city was [`[$initial]`] million and declining at a rate of [`[$growthRate]%`] per year.  Assuming the percentage growth rate remains constant, express the population [`P`] as a function of [`t`], the number of years after 2010. Continue to measure population in millions. Give your answer as a formula for [`P(t)`], written in the form *P(t)=...*.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Using the standard form for an exponentially declining quantity, [`P(t)=a(b)^t`], where [`a`] is the initial value and [`b`] is the growth factor per year. Here, we were given that [`a`] is [`[$initial]`]. To find [`b`], we use the relation

    [`b=1+r`]

where [`r`] is the relative growth rate per year. Here, [`r=-[@$growthRate/100@]`], so [`b=1-[@$growthRate/100@]`], and [`b=[$growthFactor]`]. So we have:

    [`[$answer]`]
