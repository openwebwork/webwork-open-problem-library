BEGIN_PGML

If the quantity [`Q`] is given by [`Q= [$initial]([$growthFactor])^t`]

    then the initial value of [`Q`] is [___________]{$initial},

    and the growth factor per unit [`t`] is  [___________]{$growthFactorP},

    and the relative growth rate per unit [`t`] is  [___________]{$growthRateP}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

In an exponential expression of the form [`a(b)^t`], the number [`a`] is the initial value (the value when [`t=0`]). So here, the initial value of [`Q`] is [`[$initial]`].

And the number [`b`] is the growth factor per unit [`t`]. So here, the growth factor is [`[$growthFactor]`], which can also be expressed as [`[@$growthFactor*100@]%`].

The relative growth rate per unit [`t`] is often denoted [`r`], and [`r=b-1`]. So here, [`r=[$growthFactor]-1`], which is [`[$growthRate]`]. This can also be expresses as [`[@$growthRate*100@]%`].
