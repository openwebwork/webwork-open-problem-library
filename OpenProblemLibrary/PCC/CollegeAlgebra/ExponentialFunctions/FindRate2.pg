$r = ((1+$multiYearRate/100)**(1/$time)-1)*100;

BEGIN_PGML

An investment grows by a total of [`[$multiYearRate]%`] over a [`[$time]`]-year period.  What is its effective annual interest rate?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let's call the annual growth factor [`[b]`]. Each year, the balance in the account is multiplied by [`b`]. So after  [`[$time]`] years, it will have been multiplied by [`b^[$time]`]. And we have been told that after all that time, we have multiplied our original investment by [`[$bigb]`]. This tells us that:

    [`\begin{aligned}
b^[$time] &= [$bigb]\\
b &= [$bigb]^{1/[$time]}\\
b &= [@$bigb**(1/$time)@]
\end{aligned}`]

We have been asked to find the annual growth _rate_, and right now we have found the annual growth _factor_.

    [`\begin{aligned}
r &= b-1\\
&=[@$bigb**(1/$time)@] - 1\\
&=[@$bigb**(1/$time)-1@]\\
&=[@($ans->value)*100@]%
\end{aligned}`]
