BEGIN_PGML
A once thriving company had its monthly profits, _in thousands of 
dollars_, modeled by the equation

    [``f(t) = [$f]``] 

where [` t `] is in months after January 2000.

Answer the following questions.

a) In January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [___________]{$y1C}.

a) [`[$x2]`] months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [___________]{$y2C}. (Round to *thousands of dollars*.)

a) Approximately [___________]{$x3} months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y3C]`]. (Round to a *whole number*.)

d) In the long run, the company's monthly profit would stabilize at approximately [___________]{$y4C}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) In January 2000, we have [`t=0`]. So we evaluate [`f(0)`]:

    [``f(0)=\frac{[$a](0)^2+[$b]}{[$c](0)^2+[$d]}=[$y1]``]
    
    In January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y1C]`].

a) "[`[$x2]`] months since January 2000" implies [`t=[$x2]`]. We substitute [`t=[$x2]`] into [`f(t)`], and we have:

    [``f([$x2])=\frac{[$a]([$x2])^2+[$b]}{[$c]([$x2])^2+[$d]}=[$y2Raw]\ldots``]
    
    [`[$x2]`] months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y2C]`].

a) To find when the company's monthly profit was [`[$y3C]`], we substitute [`[$y3]`] into the function's [`y`] value and solve for [`t`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   f(t) &= [$f] \\
   [$y3] &= [$f] \\
   [$y3]\cdot([$den]) &= [$f]\cdot([$den])\\
   [$s1]t^2+[$s2] &= [$num] \\
   [$s1]t^2 -[$a]t^2 &= [$b]-[$s2] \\
   [$s3]t^2 &= [$s4] \\
   t^2 &= \frac{[$s4]}{[$s3]} \\
   t &= \sqrt{\frac{[$s4]}{[$s3]}} \\
   t &\approx [$x3Raw]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
    Approximately [`[$x3]`] months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y3C]`].

a) "In the long run" suggests we examine the long term behavior of [`f`], as [`t`] becomes large.

    Since this is a rational function with the degree of the numerator equal to the degree of the denominator, it has a horizontal asymptote at 

    [`y=\frac{\mbox{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\mbox{leading coefficient of denominator}}`]

    So the horizontal asymptote is at [`y=\frac{[$a]}{[$c]}=[$y4]`]. In the graph of [`f(t)`], as [`t`] moves farther to the right, [`f(t)`] gets closer to [`[$y4]`].

    In the long run, the company's monthly profit would stabilize at approximately [`[$y4C]`].
