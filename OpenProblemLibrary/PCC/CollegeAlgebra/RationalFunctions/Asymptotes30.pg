BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The black graph has two asymptotes, the [`x`]- and [`y`]-axes. It's the familiar graph of [`f`] with [`f(x) = \frac{1}{x}`].

The red graph has [`y=1`] as a horizontal asymptote, and no vertical asymptotes.  The leading terms of numerator and denominator must be equal, and the denominator is never zero.  So the red graph is the graph of [`f`] with [`f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+1}`].

The green and yellow graphs each have two vertical asymptotes, at [`x=\pm 1`].  So their functions are the ones with the denominator being [`x^2-1`].  The green graph has a slanted asymptote. So the numerator of its function must be of degree one larger than the denominator.  The green graph is the graph of [`f`] with [`f(x) =\frac{x^3}{x^2-1}`].  The yellow graph has the [`x`]-axis as an asymptote, it's the graph of [`f`] with [`f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2-1}`].

The blue graph has the [`x`]-axis as an asymptote, and there are no vertical asymptotes.  It's the graph of [`f`] with [`f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}`].
