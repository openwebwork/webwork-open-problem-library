BEGIN_PGML

A bicycle company finds that its average cost per bicycle for producing [`n`] thousand bicycles is [`a(n)`] dollars where 

    [``a(n) = [$f]``]

What will be the approximate cost per bicycle when the company is producing many bicycles?

    The approximate cost per bicycle will be [________________________]{$ans} dollars per bicycle.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

"When the company is producing many bicycles" suggests that we think of [`n`] as being very large. So the question is asking for the long-term behavior of the function [`a`] as [`n`] gets large.

Since this is a rational function with the degree of the numerator equal to the degree of the denominator, it has a horizontal asymptote at 

    [`y=\frac{\mbox{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\mbox{leading coefficient of denominator}}`]

So that is at [`y=\frac{[$c]\cdot[$a1]}{[$b1]}`], which is at [`y=[$ans]`]. So in the graph of [`a`], as [`n`] moves farther to the right, [`a(n)`] gets closer to [`[$ans]`]. So the average cost approaches [`[$ans]`] dollars per bicycle.
