BEGIN_PGML

Some moths were introduced into a ranch, and their population can be modeled by the following function:

    [``f(t) = [$f]``] 

where [` t `] is in months since January 2000.

Answer the following questions. Round your answers to *whole numbers* when necessary.

a) In January 2000, [___________]{$y1} moths were introduced into the ranch.

a) [`[$x2]`] months since January 2000, approximately [___________]{$y2} moths live on the ranch.

a) Approximately [___________]{$x3} months since January 2000, there were [`[$y3]`] moths living on the ranch.

d) In the long run, the moth population on the ranch would stablize at approximately [___________]{$y4}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) In January 2000, we have [`t=0`]. So we evaluate [`f(0)`]:

    [``f(0)=\frac{[$a]([$b]+[$c](0))}{[$d]+[$e](0)}=[$y1]``]
    
    In January 2000, [`[$y1]`] moths were introduced into the ranch.

a) "[`[$x2]`] months since January 2000" implies [`t=[$x2]`]. We substitute [`t=[$x2]`] into [`f(t)`], and we have:

    [``f([$x2])=\frac{[$a]([$b]+[$c]([$x2]))}{[$d]+[$e]([$x2])}=[$y2Raw]\ldots``]
    
    [`[$x2]`] months since January 2000, approximately [`[$y2]`] moths live on the ranch.

a) To find when there were [`[$y3]`] moths living on the ranch, we substitute [`[$y3]`] into the function's [`y`] value and solve for [`t`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   f(t) &= [$f] \\
   [$y3] &= [$f] \\
   [$y3]\cdot([$den]) &= [$f]\cdot([$den])\\
   [$s1]+[$s2]t &= [$num] \\
   [$s1]+[$s2]t &= [$ab]+[$ac]t \\
   [$s2]t -[$ac]t &= [$ab]-[$s1] \\
   [$s3]t &= [$s4] \\
   t & [$s5] \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
    Approximately [`[$x3]`] months since January 2000, there were [`[$y3]`] moths living on the ranch.

a) "In the long run" suggests we examine the long term behavior of [`f`], as [`t`] becomes large.

    Since this is a rational function with the degree of the numerator equal to the degree of the denominator, it has a horizontal asymptote at 

    [`y=\frac{\mbox{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\mbox{leading coefficient of denominator}}`]
    
    We need to re-write [`f(t)`]:
    
    [``
\begin{aligned}
   f(t) &= [$f] \\
        &= \frac{[$numE1]}{[$den]} \\
        &= \frac{[$numE2]}{[$denE1]} \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]

    So the horizontal asymptote is at [`y=\frac{[$ac]}{[$e]}=[$y4]`]. In the graph of [`f(t)`], as [`t`] moves farther to the right, [`f(t)`] gets closer to [`[$y4]`].

    In the long run, the moth population on the ranch would stablize at approximately [`[$y4]`].
