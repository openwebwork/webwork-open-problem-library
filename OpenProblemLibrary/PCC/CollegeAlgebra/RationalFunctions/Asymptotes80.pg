BEGIN_PGML

In a certain store, cashiers can serve [`[$a]`] customers per hour on average. If [`x`] customers arrive at the store in a given hour, then the average number of customers [`C`] waiting in line can be modeled by the function

    [`` C(x) = [$func] ``]

where [`x<[$a]`].

Answer the following questions with a graphing calculator. Round your answers to integers.

a. If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [__________]{$y1r} customers waiting in line.

a. If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [__________]{$ans2} customers arrived in the past hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, approximately how many customers are waiting in line. To answer this question, we substitute [`x`] with [`[$x1]`], and we have:

    [`` C([$x1]) = \frac{[$x1]^{2}}{[$a2]-[$a]([$x1])} \approx [$y1] \approx [$y1r] ``]

    If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [`[$y1r]`] customers waiting in line.

a. If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately how many customers arrived in the past hour? To answer this question, we substitute [`C`] with [`[$y2r]`], and we have:

    [`` [$y2r]= [$func] ``]

We will solve for [`x`] in this equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$y2r] &= [$func] \\
   [$y2r]\cdot([$den]) &= [$func]\cdot([$den]) \\
   [$y2r*$a2]-[$y2r*$a]x &= [$num] \\
   0 &= x^2 + [$B]x + [$C] \\
   x &= \frac{-[$B]\pm\sqrt{([$B])^2-4([$A])([$C])}}{2([$A])} \\
   x &= \frac{-[$B]\pm[$D2]}{[$A*2]} \\
   x &= \frac{-[$B]+[$D2]}{[$A*2]} \text{ or } x = \frac{-[$B]-[$D2]}{[$A*2]} \\
   x &= [$r1] \text{ or } x = [$r2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

    Ignore the negative solution, and round the reasonable solution to [`[$ans2]`].

    If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [`[$ans2]`] customers arrived in the past hour.
