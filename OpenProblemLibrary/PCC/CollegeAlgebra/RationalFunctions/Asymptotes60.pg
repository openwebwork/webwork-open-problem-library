BEGIN_PGML
A once thriving company had its monthly profits, _in thousands of 
dollars_, modeled by the equation

    [``f(t) = [$f]``] 

where [` t `] is in months after June, 2002. Graph this function on your calculator.

a) Estimate the company's monthly profits for June, 2002.  

    The profits for June, 2002 were about [___________]{$ans1c}

a) Estimate the company's monthly profits many years into the future.  

    The monthly profits many years into the future will be about [___________]{$ans2c}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) In June, 2002, we have [`t=0`]. So we evaluate [`f(0)`] and get [`[$ans1/1000]`]. . Note that we have found the [`y`]-intercept of the graph for [`f`]. Since the function is giving outputs in thousands of dollars, the profits that month were [`[$ans1c]`].

a) "Many years into the future" suggests we examine the long term behavior of [`f`], as [`t`] becomes large.

    Since this is a rational function with the degree of the numerator equal to the degree of the denominator, it has a horizontal asymptote at 

    [`y=\frac{\mbox{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\mbox{leading coefficient of denominator}}`]

    So that is at [`y=\frac{1}{[$b]}`], which is at [`y=[$ans2/1000]`]. So in the graph of [`f`], as [`t`] moves farther to the right, [`f(t)`] gets closer to [`[$ans2/1000]`]. So the monthly profits approach [`[$ans2c]`].
