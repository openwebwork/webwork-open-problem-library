BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The zero at [`[$r0]`] is a degree one zero. So we can determine the slope there by preserving that zero's corresponding factor, and substituting in the zero elsewhere. 

At [`x=[$r0]`],

    [`\begin{aligned}
[$p] &\longrightarrow [$c][@$p0->substitute(y=>Formula("$r0"))->TeX@]
= [@($slope[0]/3)->TeX@]([$f0])\\
\end{aligned}`]

So the slope at [`x=[$r0]`] is [`[@($slope[0]/3)->TeX@]\cdot3`], which is [`[@$slope[0]->TeX@]`]. Basically, this has told us that for [`x`]-values close to [`[$r0]`], our function is very much like [`[@($slope[0]/3)->TeX@]([$f0])`], which is a line with slope [`[@$slope[0]->TeX@]`] that has been shifted to cross the [`x`]-axis at [`[$r0]`].

The other zero, [`[$r1]`], is a degree two zero. This means that as the curve approaches [`([$r1],0)`], it will behave like the vertex of the parabola and turn around. That means the slope at that point will be [`0`], without any further calculation needed.

We can do as with did with the first zero anyway, to confirm this.

    [`\begin{aligned}
[$p] &\longrightarrow [$c][@$p1->substitute(y=>Formula("$r1"))->TeX@]
= [$f1]\\
\end{aligned}`]

This tells us that near [`[$r1]`], the curve is very similar to [`y=[$f1]`], which is the parabola [`y=x^2`] after a shift and a vertical scaling. So at [`x=[$r1]`], the curve behaves like tip of a parabola, and has slope [`0`].
