TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

The compound interest formula is

    [`` A(t) = P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} ``]
    
where [`A(t)`] models the amount of money, [`t`] is the number of years, [`P`] is the initial amount, [`r`] is the annual interest and [`n`] is the number of compoundings per year.

[$name] saved [`[$initialC]`] in an account with an annual interest of [`[$r]%`]. Answer the following questions:

1) The amount of money in the account would be [___________]{$y1C} after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded yearly.

2) The amount of money in the account would be [___________]{$y2C} after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded quarterly.

3) The amount of money in the account would be [___________]{$y3C} after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded monthly.

4) The amount of money in the account would be [___________]{$y4C} after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded daily (assuming that year has 365 days).

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

###Question 1

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(t)
      &= [$initial](1+\frac{[$rd]}{1})^{(1)([$x])} \\
      &\approx [$y1] \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The amount of money in the account would be [`[$y1C]`] after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded yearly.

###Question 2

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(t)
      &= [$initial](1+\frac{[$rd]}{4})^{(4)([$x])} \\
      &\approx [$y2] \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The amount of money in the account would be [`[$y2C]`] after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded quarterly.

###Question 3

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(t)
      &= [$initial](1+\frac{[$rd]}{12})^{(12)([$x])} \\
      &\approx [$y3] \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The amount of money in the account would be [`[$y3C]`] after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded monthly.

###Question 4

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(t)
      &= [$initial](1+\frac{[$rd]}{365})^{(365)([$x])} \\
      &\approx [$y4] \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The amount of money in the account would be [`[$y4C]`] after [`[$x]`] years, if the interest is compounded daily.
