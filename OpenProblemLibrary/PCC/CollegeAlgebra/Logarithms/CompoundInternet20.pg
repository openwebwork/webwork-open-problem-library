BEGIN_PGML

The continuously compounded interest formula is

    [`` A(t) = P\cdot e^{rt} ``]
    
where [`A(t)`] models the amount of money, [`t`] is the number of years, [`P`] is the initial amount and [`r`] is the annual interest.

[$name] borrowed [`[$initialC]`] from a credit card company, with an annual interest of [`[$r]%`]. The interest is compounded continuously. Answer the following questions:

1) The amount owed would become [___________]{$y1C} after [`[$x1]`] years.

2) The amount owed would become [`[$y2C]`] after [_____________]{$x2R} years. Round your answer to one decimal place.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

###Question 1

Substitute [`t=[$x1]`] into [`A(t)`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(t) &= [$initial]e^{[$rd]t} \\
   A([$x1]) &= [$initial]e^{[$rd]([$x1])} \\
            &\approx [$y1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The amount owed would become [`[$y1C]`] after [`[$x1]`] years.

###Question 2

Substitute [`A(t)=[$y2]`] into [`A(t)`] and solve for [`t`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A(t) &= [$initial]e^{[$rd]t} \\
   [$y2] &= [$initial]e^{[$rd]t} \\
   \frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]} &= e^{[$rd]t} \\
   \ln\left( \frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]} \right) &= [$rd]t \\
   \frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$rd]} &= t \\
   t &\approx [$x2R]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The amount owed would become [`[$y2C]`] after [`[$x2R]`] years.
