BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) This one is *true*. It is the basic product-addition rule for logarithms.

a) This one is *false*. You cannot break up a logarithm over a plus sign.

a) This one is *false*. It kind of resembles the basic product-addition rule for logarithms, but it is backwards.

a) This one is *false*. It kind of resembles the basic quotient-subtraction rule for logarithms, but that rule involves a quotient _inside_ a logarithm.

a) This one is *true*. This is one of the basic logarithm rules.

a) This one is *true*. It is one on the basic logarithm rules. Also, it is the same equation as the previous question with [`k=-1`].

a) This one is *false*. Raising to the [`1/2`] power is the same as taking a square root, and so this would say that having a square root outside of a logarithm is equivalent to having it inside. But that is just not true. Try evaluating both sides with [`x=10`] and you should see that the equation is false.

a) This one is *true*. Since a square root is the same as raising to the [`1/2`] power, this is the same question as part e, but with [`k=1/2`].
