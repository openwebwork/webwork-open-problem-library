TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

The population of bacteria in a container follows the law of uninhibited growth. At the beginning, there were [`[$initial]`] grams of bacteria. After [`[$x1]`] hours, there were [`[$y1R]`] grams of bacteria.

Answer the following question.

After [___________]{$x2R} hours, there would be [`[$y2]`] grams of bacteria. Round your answer to one decimal place.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since the bacteria population follows the law of unihibited growth, with an initial weight of [`[$initial]`] grams, we can model the bacteria's weight by the following function:

    [`` w(t) = [$initial]e^{kt}, ``]
    
where [`k`] is the growth rate and [`t`] is the number of hours. To solve for the constant [`k`], we need to use the given condition that, after [`[$x1]`] hours, there were [`[$y1R]`] grams of bacteria. Substitute in those two given values, we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   w(t) &= [$initial]e^{kt} \\
   [$y1R] &= [$initial]\cdot e^{k([$x1])} \\
   \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} &= e^{k([$x1])} \\
   \ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right) &= k([$x1]) \\
   \frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$x1]} &= k
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
The bacteria's weight can be modeled by the function

    [`` w(t) = [$initial]e^{\frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$x1]}t}, ``]
    
where [`k`] is the growth rate and [`t`] is the number of hours. Note that we didn't round the value of [`k`] in order to get more accurate answers.

To find when there would be [`[$y2]`] grams of bacteria, we need to substitute the function's value with [`[$y2]`], and then solve for [`t`].

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   w(t) &= [$initial]e^{\frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$x1]}t} \\
   [$y2] &= [$initial]e^{\frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$x1]}t} \\
   \frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]} &= e^{\frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$x1]}t} \\
   \ln\left(\frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]}\right) &= \frac{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)}{[$x1]}t \\
   [$x1]\ln\left(\frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]}\right) &= \ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)t \\
   \frac{[$x1]\ln\left(\frac{[$y2]}{[$initial]}\right)}{\ln\left( \frac{[$y1R]}{[$initial]} \right)} &= t \\
   [$x2R] &\approx t
\end{aligned}
    ``]

After [`[$x2R]`] hours, there would be [`[$y2]`] grams of bacteria.
