TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A radioactive material's half life is [`[$h]`] hours. There were [`[$initial]`] grams of this material initially. Answer the following question.

There would be [___________]{$yR} grams left after [`[$x]`] hours. Round your answer to two decimal places.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let the following function model the material's weight, in grams:

    [`` w(t)=C\cdot e^{kt} ``]
    
where [`k`] is a constant, [`C`] is the material's initial weight in grams and [`t`] is the number of hours.

Since the material's half life is [`[$h]`] hours, we can substitute [`t=[$h]`] and [`w(t)=0.5C`] into the function, and solve for [`k`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   w(t) &= C\cdot e^{kt} \\
   0.5C &= C\cdot e^{k([$h])} \\
   0.5 &= e^{k([$h])} \\
   \ln(0.5) &= k([$h]) \\
   \frac{\ln(0.5)}{[$h]} &= k
\end{aligned}
    ``]

We have found [`k`]'s value. It's given there were [`[$initial]`] grams of materials initially, so the function to model the material's weight is:

    [`` w(t)=[$initial]\cdot e^{\frac{\ln(0.5)}{[$h]}t} ``]
    
Note that we didn't round [`k`]'s value in order to get more accurate values.

To find the material's weight after [`[$x]`] hours, we substitute [`t=[$x]`] into [`w(t)`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   w(t) &= [$initial]\cdot e^{\frac{\ln(0.5)}{[$h]}t} \\
   w([$x]) &= [$initial]\cdot e^{\frac{\ln(0.5)}{[$h]}([$x])} \\
   w([$x]) &\approx [$yR]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
    
There would be [`[$yR]`] grams left after [`[$x]`] hours.
