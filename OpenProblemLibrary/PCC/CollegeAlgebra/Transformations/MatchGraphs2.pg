The graph of [`y=[@$f[0]->TeX@]`] is the graph of [`y=x^2`] after having been compressed vertically toward the [`x`]-axis by a factor of [`2`]. So that is the graph

The graph of [`y=[@$f[1]->TeX@]`] is the graph of [`y=x^2`] after having been compressed vertically toward the [`x`]-axis by a factor of [`2`], and shifted down by [`[$a]`] units. So that is the graph

The graph of [`y=[@$f[2]->TeX@]`] is the graph of [`y=x^2`] after having been compressed vertically toward the [`x`]-axis by a factor of [`2`], and shifted right by [`[$a]`] units. So that is the graph

The graph of [`y=[@$f[3]->TeX@]`] is the graph of [`y=x^2`] after having been compressed vertically toward the [`x`]-axis by a factor of [`2`], shifted up by [`[$b]`] units, and shifted left by [`[$c]`] units. So that is the graph
