BEGIN_PGML
Start with [`f`], where [`f(x)=\sqrt{x} `]. Let [`g`] be the function that we have after performing the following transformations:
shift to the left [`[$a]`] units, scale horizontally by a factor of
[`[$b]`], and reflect over the [`x`]-axis.

Using [|sqrt(x)|] for [`\sqrt{x}`], The new function has formula

    [`g(x)={}`][_____________________] 

END_PGML

$ans1 = "-sqrt(1/$b *x + $a)";

ANS(fun_cmp($ans1));


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

After a shift of [`[$a]`] units to the left, the function looks like [`f(x + [$a])`], which is [`\sqrt{x + [$a]}`]. 

The subsequent scaling is the hardest part.  There are two things to remember:  
a) horizontal scaling works in the opposite way from what intuition dictates, so scaling by a factor of [`[$b]`] means the graph is compressing toward the [`y`]-axis by a factor of [`\frac{1}{[$b]}`].  

a) The scaling factor affects only the [`x`], not the [`x + [$a]`]. 

Thus the function now looks like [`f\left(\frac{1}{[$b]} x + [$a]\right)`], which is [`\sqrt{\frac{1}{[$b]} x + [$a]}`]. 

Finally, when reflecting through the [`x`]-axis, a _vertical_ reflection, we have [`g(x) = -{\sqrt{\frac{1}{[$b]} x + [$a]}}`].
