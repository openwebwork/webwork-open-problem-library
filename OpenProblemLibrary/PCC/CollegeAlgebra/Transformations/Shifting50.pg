BEGIN_PGML
The function [` f `] has domain [`[$domain]`] and range [`[$range]`]. Use what you know about graph transformations to find the domain and range of these other functions.


a) Let [`g(x) = f(x)+[$a]`].  

    [`g`] has domain [__________________] and range [__________________]


a) Let [`h(x) = f(x-[$b])`].  

    [`h`] has domain [__________________] and range [__________________]

a) Let [`k(x) = f(x-[$a])+[$c]`].  

    [`k`] has domain [__________________] and range [__________________]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) The graph of [`g`] is the graph of [`f`] shifted up by [`[$a]`] units, so the two functions have the same domain, but the range of [`g`] is [`([$r]+[$a],[$s]+[$a]]`], which is [`([$r+$a],[$s+$a]]`].

a) The graph of [`h`] is the graph of [`f`] shifted right by [`[$b]`] units, so the two functions have the same range, but the domain of [`h`] is [`(-\infty,[$q]+[$b])`], which is [`(-\infty,[$q+$b])`].

a) The graph of [`k`] is the graph of [`f`] shifted right by [`[$a]`] units and up by [`[$c]`] units. So the domain of [`k`] is [`(-\infty,[$q]+[$a])`], which is [`(-\infty,[$q+$a])`], and the range of [`k`] is [`([$r]+[$c],[$s]+[$c]]`], which is [`([$r+$c],[$s+$c]]`].
