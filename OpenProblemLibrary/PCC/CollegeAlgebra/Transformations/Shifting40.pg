BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a) The graph of [`y=f(x)+[$a]`] is the graph of [`f`] shifted up by [`[$a]`] units. So this graph will contain the point [`([$p],[$q]+[$a])`], which is [`([$p],[$q+$a])`].

a) The graph of [`y=f(x+[$b])`] is the graph of [`f`] shifted left by [`[$b]`] units. So this graph will contain the point [`([$p]-[$b],[$q])`], which is [`([$p-$b],[$q])`].

a) The graph of [`y=f(x-[$a])-[$c]`] is the graph of [`f`] shifted right by [`[$a]`] units and down by [`[$c]`] units. So this graph will contain the point [`([$p]+[$a],[$q]-[$c])`], which is [`([$p+$a],[$q-$c])`].
