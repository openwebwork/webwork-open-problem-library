BEGIN_PGML
In the following, if your answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, [`\cup`], which you can type as *U*. If you need  to enter the [`\infty`] symbol, type it as *inf*.

Given that [` f(x)=[$f]`] and [`\displaystyle g(x)=[$g]`], find and simplify each of the following:

a) [`\left(fg\right)(x)={}`][________________________]{$ftg} and the domain of [`\left(fg\right)`] is [________________________]{$ftgd}  
a) [`\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x)={}`][________________________]{$fdg} and the domain of [`\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)`] is [________________________]{$fdgd}
a) [`\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x)={}`][________________________]{$gdf} and the domain of [`\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)`] is  [________________________]{$gdfd}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Note that the domain of [`f`] is [`(-\infty,\infty)`] and the domain of [`g`] is [`(-\infty,[$c])\cup([$c], \infty)`].

a) [`\begin{aligned}[t]
\left(fg\right)(x)
&= f(x)\cdot g(x)\\
&= \left([$f]\right)\left([$g]\right)\\
&= [$ftg]
\end{aligned}`]  
To find the domain of [`fg`] we just need to intersect the domains of [`f`] and [`g`]. That is, we take all [`x`]-values that are in both [`f`]'s domain and [`g`]'s domain. So  its domain is [`[$ftgd]`].  

a) [`\begin{aligned}[t]
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x)
&= \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\
&= \frac{[$f]}{[$g]}\\
&= [$fdg]
\end{aligned}`]  
To find the domain of [`\frac{f}{g}`] we _start_ by intersecting the domains of [`f`] and [`g`]. That is, we take all [`x`]-values that are in both [`f`]'s domain and [`g`]'s domain. This gives us [`[$ftgd]`].  Normally we _also_ have to exclude any [`x`]-values that cause [`g(x)`] to equal [`0`]. In this case, there are no such [`x`]-values though. So the domain of [`\frac{f}{g}`] is [`[$fdgd]`].  

a) [`\begin{aligned}[t]
\left(\frac{g}{f}\right)(x)
&= \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\\
&= \frac{[$g]}{[$f]}\\
&= [$gdf]
\end{aligned}`]  
To find the domain of [`\frac{g}{f}`] we _start_ by intersecting the domains of [`f`] and [`g`]. That is, we take all [`x`]-values that are in both [`f`]'s domain and [`g`]'s domain. This gives us [`[$ftgd]`].  We _also_ have to exclude any [`x`]-values that cause [`f(x)`] to equal [`0`]. In this case, that means we need to exclude [`[$a]`] and [`-[$a]`].  So the domain of [`\frac{g}{f}`] is [`[$gdfd]`].
