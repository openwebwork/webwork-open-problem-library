BEGIN_PGML

You will build a rectangular pen with [`[$p]`] yards of fence. If the pen's height is [`h`] yards, the length of the pen's base, in yards, can be modeled by the function [`b(h)`]. In this context, find the domain of [`b(h)`].

Using interval notation, the domain of the function [`b(h)`] is [__________________________________]{$ans}

[@KeyboardInstructions('If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the union symbol, which you can type as [|U|]*. If the answer uses [`\infty`], you may type it as [|inf|]*.')@]** 
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since you have [`[$p]`] yards of fence to use, the rectangular pen's perimeter is [`[$p]`] yards. Assume the pen's base is [`b`] yards, and its height is [`h`] yards. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   2(b+h)&=[$p] \\
   b+h&=[$q] \\
   b&=[$q]-h
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In function notation, we have [`b(h)=[$q]-h`].

The value of [`h`] must be greater than [`0`] in this context.

The value of [`h`] cannot be greater than or equal to [`[$q]`]; otherwise the pen's base would have a negative length.

Therefore the domain is [`[$ans]`].
