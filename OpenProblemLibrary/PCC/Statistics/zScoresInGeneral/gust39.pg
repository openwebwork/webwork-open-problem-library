a)  The area under the standard Normal curve that lies to the left of \(z=$z1\) is \($area1string\).  Without consulting a the table giving areas under the standard Normal curve, determine the area under the standard Normal curve that lies to the right of \(z=$z1\). $BR  answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) The standard Normal curve has a total area of \(1\).  Since the area to the left of \(z=$z1\) is \($area1string\), there is an area of \(1-$area1string=$leftover\), or, \(\approx$ans\) on the right side.
$PAR
(b)  Option \(D\).  We needed to use the fact that the standard Normal curve has a total area of \(1\) to find the area on the right side.
