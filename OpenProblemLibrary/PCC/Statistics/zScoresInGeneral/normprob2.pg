BEGIN_TEXT

The combined math and verbal scores for 
students taking a national standardized examination for college admission is
Normally distributed with a mean of \($mu\) and a standard deviation of \($sig\). 
If a college requires a student to be in the top \($p$PERCENT\) of students taking this test, 
what is the minimum score that such a student can obtain and still qualify for admission at
the college? Remember that scores on this test are whole numbers.
$PAR
\{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

To reach the top \($p$PERCENT\) of scores, means you have done better than \($leftp$PERCENT\) of all other people who take the test.  To find the \(z\)-score that corresponds to the score that puts you in the top \($p$PERCENT\), we need to use the area corresponding to \($leftp$PERCENT\) since our technology can only "look left."
$PAR
Using inverse technology with an area of \($leftarea\), we find \(z=$z\).
$PAR
This allows us to find the score in question by using the \(z\)-score formula.  Thus, we find \($z=\frac{x-$mu}{$sig}\) which can be solved to find \(x\approx $ans\).  Since test scores must be a whole number and we want to be in the top \($p$PERCENT\), we will round our score up to \(x=$ansround\).
