BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) Our goal is to find a \(z\)-score such that \($aap$PERCENT\) is to the left of it, or, an area of \($aa\) is $BBOLD below $EBOLD it.  Using inverse technology commands with an area of \($aa\), we find \(z=$a\).
$PAR
(b) Our goal is to find a \(z\)-score such that an area of \($bb\) is to the left of it, or, $BBOLD below $EBOLD it.  Using inverse technology commands with an area of \($bb\), we find \(z\approx$b\).
$PAR
(c) Our goal is to find a \(z\)-score such that \($ccp$PERCENT\) is to the right of it, or, an area of \($cc\) is $BBOLD above $EBOLD it.  Since our technology can only "look left," this means the area below the \(z\)-score in question is \(1-$cc=$ccleft\).  Using inverse technology commands with an area of \($ccleft\), we find \(z\approx$c\).
$PAR
(d) Our goal is to find a \(z\)-score such that an area of \($dd\) is to the right of it, or, $BBOLD above $EBOLD it.  Since our technology can only "look left," this means the area below the \(z\)-score in question is \(1-$dd=$ddleft\).  Using inverse technology commands with an area of \($ddleft\), we find \(z\approx$d\).
