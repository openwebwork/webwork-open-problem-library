BEGIN_TEXT

As reported in "Runner's World" magazine, the finishing times of the runners in the New York City \(10\) km run are Normally distributed with a mean of \($mean\) minutes and a standard deviation of \($stddev\) minutes.  Let \(x\) denote finishing time for a runner. Type $BBOLD min$EBOLD for minutes. $BR

$PAR
a)  The distribution of the variable \(x\) has mean \{ans_rule(10)\} and standard deviation  \{ans_rule(10)\}. $BR

$PAR
b)  The distribution of the standardized variable \(z\) has mean \{ans_rule(10)\} and standard deviation  \{ans_rule(10)\}. $BR

$PAR
c)  The percentage of finishers with times between \($time1\) and \($time2\) minutes is equal to the area under the standard Normal curve between the \(z\)-scores\{ans_rule(10)\} and \{ans_rule(10)\}. $BR

$PAR
d)  The percentage of finishers with times exceeding \($time3\) minutes is equal to the area under the standard Normal curve that lies \{ $popup->menu() \} of \{ans_rule(10)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  Based on the question, we know that the variable \(x\) has mean \($mean\)min and standard deviation \($stddev\)min.
$PAR
(b)  Anytime we standardize a variable we have the mean as \(0\) and standard deviation \(1\).
$PAR
(c)  The percentage of finishers with times between \($time1\) and \($time2\) minutes correspond to \(z\)-scores of \(z_{$time1}=\frac{$time1-$mean}{$stddev}=$z1\) and \(z_{$time2}=\frac{$time2-$mean}{$stddev}=$z2\).  
$PAR
(d) The percentage of finishers with times exceeding \($time3\) minutes corresponds to a \(z\)-score of \(z_{$time3}=\frac{$time3-$mean}{$stddev}=$z3\).  As we want to know the percentage of finishers with times exceeding \($time3\) minutes, this means we want the area to the right of \(z=$z3\)
