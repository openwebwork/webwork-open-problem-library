#  Main

BEGIN_TEXT
Almost all medical schools in the United States require applicants to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). On one exam, the scores of all applicants on the biological sciences part of the MCAT were approximately Normal with mean \($mean_all\) and standard deviation \($sd_all\). For applicants who actually entered medical school, the mean score was \($mean_med\) and the standard deviation was \($sd_med\).

$PAR
(a) What percent of all applicants had scores higher than \($cutoff_a\)?
$BR $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE \{ans_rule(5)\} 

$PAR
(b) What percent of those who entered medical school had scores between \($cutoff_b1\) and \($cutoff_b2\)?

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) In regards to "all applicants" there is a mean of \($mean_all\) and standard deviation \($sd_all\).  To find the percent of applicants who score higher than \($cutoff_a\), we need a \(z\)-score.  We find, \(z=\frac{$cutoff_a-$mean_all}{$sd_all}=$z1\).
$PAR 
Using technology, we find \(\text{P}(z>$z1)\approx$pval_a\), which can also be seen in the graph below.
$PAR
\{Plot($diagrama, tex_size=>900)\}
$PAR 
(b) In regards to those who "entered medical school," we have a mean of \($mean_med\) and standard deviation \($sd_med\).  To find the percent of students who scored between \($cutoff_b1\) and \($cutoff_b2\) we will need two \(z\)-scores.  Thus we find \(z_{$cutoff_b1} = \frac{$cutoff_b1-$mean_med}{$sd_med}=$z2\) and \(z_{$cutoff_b2} = \frac{$cutoff_b2-$mean_med}{$sd_med}=$z3\).
$PAR
Using technology, we find \(\text{P}($z2<z<$z3)\approx$pval_b\), which can also be seen in the graph below.
$PAR
\{Plot($diagramb, tex_size=>900)\}
