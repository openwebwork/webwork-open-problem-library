BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) Our goal is to find a \(z\)-score such that \($showpval1$PERCENT\) of observations are $BBOLD below $EBOLD it.  This means the area below the \(z\)-score in question is \($pval1\).  Using inverse technology commands with an area of \($pval1\), we find \(z\approx$zscore1...\)
$PAR
(b)  Our goal is to find a \(z\)-score such that \($showpval2$PERCENT\) of observations are $BBOLD above $EBOLD it.  Since our inverse technology can only "look left," we need to look up the \(z\)-score that has an area of \(1-$pval2=$belowpval2\).  Using inverse technology commands with an area of \($belowpval2\), we find \(z\approx$zscore2...\)
