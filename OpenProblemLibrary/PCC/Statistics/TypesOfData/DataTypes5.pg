BEGIN_TEXT

Alex has been wondering how good the gas mileage is for his car. When he goes to the gas station, he writes down the number of miles in his trip meter, fills the tank, and writes down the number of gallons of gas to fill the tank. Then he resets the trip meter.

If you don't get this in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
First ask what is being recorded: a number of miles driven, and a number of gallons of gas used. Each time those things are recorded, who or what are they describing? For example, would \(315\) miles and \(15\) gallons describe Alex or one of the attendants? Clearly not.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Each time data is recorded here, it is a number that could take high decimal precision. So we have Continuous Quantitative data. And each time we record this data, we are describing a period of time between trips to the gas station. So the answer to the first question is \{ $mcIndividuals->correct_ans() \}, and to the second is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}.
