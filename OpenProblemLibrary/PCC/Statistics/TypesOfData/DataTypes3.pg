BEGIN_TEXT

Patients in an intensive care unit in a hospital are asked to rate the pain that they are feeling on a scale of 1 to 10.

If you don't get this in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.
END_TEXT
BEGIN_HINT
Is the datum from each individual a number, a category, or somehow both? If it's a number, does arithmetic on data make much sense?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}. Each individual is basically declaring themselves to be in one of ten possible categories, but the categories have a natural order: a pain assessment of 2 is more painful than a pain assessment of 1, etc. This means that we might have Quantitative Discrete data, or we might have Rank data. But arithmetic on the data doesn't make much sense. For example, is the difference in pain between a level-9 and level-10 the same as the difference in pain between a level-3 and level-4? Is the pain felt by a level-6 "twice as much" as the pain felt by a level-3? We cannot clearly answer yes to these questions. With arithmetic not really correlating to the values on the pain scale, we do not really have Quantitative data.
