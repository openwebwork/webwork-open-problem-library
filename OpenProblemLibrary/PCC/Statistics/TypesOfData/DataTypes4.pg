If you don't get this in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.

BEGIN_HINT
Is the datum from each individual a number, a category, or somehow both? If it's a number, does arithmetic on data make much sense?

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The correct answer is \{ $mc->correct_ans() \}. Each individual is providing a number, so we do not have Qualitative (aka Categorical) data. The values of the data are whole numbers, so the data is not Continuous. And the values of the data really do correlate well to what is being measured: a 50-year-old really does have twice the age of a 25-year-old; the difference in age between a 28-year-old and a 32-year-old is the same as between a 38-year-old and a 42-year-old. So we do not have Rank data. We have Quantitative Discrete data.
