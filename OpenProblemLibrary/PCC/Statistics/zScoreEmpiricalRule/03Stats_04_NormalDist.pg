According to the Empirical Rule, \(95$PERCENT\) of individuals fall within \(2\) standard deviations of the mean. So \(2.5$PERCENT\) of individuals fall above a \(z\)-score of \(2\). So \(2.5$PERCENT\) of men are taller than \(74\) inches",

According to the Empirical Rule, \(68$PERCENT\) of individuals fall within \(1\) standard deviation of the mean. So \(16$PERCENT\) of individuals fall below a \(z\)-score of \(-1\). So \(16$PERCENT\) of men are taller than \(66.5\) inches",

"A height of \(69\) inches corresponds to a \(z\)-score of \(z=\frac{69 - 69}{2.5} = 0\). The center of the normal curve has a \(z\)-score of \(0\) with half of all individuals above and the other half below the center.  So, \(50$PERCENT\) of individuals fall above a \(z\)-score of \(0\).  So \(50$PERCENT\) of men are taller than \(69\) inches",

"A height of \(69\) inches corresponds to a \(z\)-score of \(z=\frac{69 - 69}{2.5} = 0\) and \(74\) inches corresponds to a \(z\)-score of \(\frac{74 - 69}{2.5} = 2\). According to the Empirical Rule, \(95$PERCENT\) of individuals fall within \(2\) standard deviations of the mean. So half of this falls between a \(z\)-score of \(0\) and a \(z\)-score of \(2\).

According to the Empirical Rule, \(68$PERCENT\) of individuals fall within \(1\) standard deviation of the mean and \(95$PERCENT\) of individuals fall within \(2\) standard deviations from the mean.  As such, to find the total percentage between \(-1\) and \(-2\) standard deviations from we the mean, we take \(95$PERCENT - 68$PERCENT = 27$PERCENT\), but this also counts the individuals between \(z=1\) and \(z=2\). So half of \(27$PERCENT\), or \(13.5$PERCENT\) of men are between \(64\) inches and \(66.5\) inches.",

"This question will require we find a height, in inches.  We know \(2.5$PERCENT\) of men are shorter than a particular height.  Each height has a \(z\)-score, therefore we can find a \(z\)-score for this height.  According to the Empirical Rule, a \(z\)-score of of \(-2\) corresponds to a value such that \(2.5$PERCENT\) of all individuals are shorter than this height.  Thus, \(-2 = \frac{x-69}{2.5}\), which can be solved to reveal that \(x = 64\).  Therefore \(2.5$PERCENT\) of men are shorter than \(64\) inches.",
