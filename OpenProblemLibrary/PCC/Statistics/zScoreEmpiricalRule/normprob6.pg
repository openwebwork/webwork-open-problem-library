BEGIN_TEXT
Colleen, Teresa, and Mary are vying for a position as an administrator. Applicants must take an exam for this position.  For the sake of the integrity of the exam, it is altered after each time it is given. Colleen, who is tested with group I, gets a score of \($score1\) on her test; Teresa, who is tested with group II, gets a score of \($score2\); and Mary, who is tested with group III, 
gets a score of \($score3\).  If the average score for group I is \($mu1\), for group II is \($mu2\), and for group III is \($mu3\), and if the standard deviations for each of the groups are \($sig1\), \($sig2\), and \($sig3\) respectively, which person has the highest relative standing?

$PAR
\{ $popup->menu() \} has the highest relative standing.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

As we are interested in the highest relative standing in terms of test scores, we need to find the \(z\)-score for all three candidates and see who has the highest.

$PAR

\(z_{Colleen} = \frac{$score1 - $mu1}{$sig1} = $realz1\)

$PAR

\(z_{Teresa} = \frac{$score2 - $mu2}{$sig2} = $realz2\)

$PAR 

\(z_{Mary} = \frac{$score3 - $mu3}{$sig3} = $realz3\)

$PAR 

As the \(z\)-score of \($best\) belongs $ans, $ans has the highest relative standing for all the test takers.
