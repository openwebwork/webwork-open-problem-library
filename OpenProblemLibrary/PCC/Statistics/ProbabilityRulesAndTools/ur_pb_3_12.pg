BEGIN_TEXT

An elementary school is offering 3 language classes: one in Spanish, one in French, and one in German. These classes are open to any of the $total students in the school. There are $span in the Spanish class, $fren in the French class, and $ger in the German class. There are $sp_fr students that in both Spanish and French, $sp_ger are in both Spanish and German, and $fr_ger are in both French and German. In addition, there are $a students taking all 3 classes. $BR

If one student is chosen randomly, what is the probability that he or she is $quest1[$tag1] \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

If two students are chosen randomly, what is the probability that $quest2[$tag2] \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
