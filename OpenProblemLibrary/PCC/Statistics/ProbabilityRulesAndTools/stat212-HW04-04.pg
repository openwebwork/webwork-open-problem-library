BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
An aerospace company has submitted bids on two separate federal government defense contracts.  The company president believes that there is a $a$PERCENT 
probability of winning the first contract.  If they win the first contract, the probability of winning the second is $b$PERCENT.  However, if they lose the first contract, the president thinks that the probability of winning the second contract decreases to $c$PERCENT.
$PAR
A. What is the probability that they win both contracts?  
\{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. What is the probability that they lose both contracts?  
\{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
C. What is the probability that they win only one contract? 
\{ans_rule(15)\}
