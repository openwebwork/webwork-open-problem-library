$PAR 
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have determined that children under 2 years old who sleep with the lights on have a $a$PERCENT chance of becoming myopic before they are 16.  Children who sleep in darkness have a $b$PERCENT probability of becoming myopic.  A survey indicates that $c$PERCENT of children under 2 sleep with some light on.  Find the probability that a random child under 2 will become myopic before reaching 16 years old.  
$PAR
The probability is \{ans_rule(15)\}.
