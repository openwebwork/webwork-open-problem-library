BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
A foreman for an injection-molding firm admits that on $a$PERCENT of his shifts, he forgets to shut off the injection machine on his line.  This causes the machine to overheat, increasing the probability that a defective molding will be produced during the early morning run from $b$PERCENT to $c$PERCENT.  The plant manager randomly selects a molding from the early morning run and discovers it is defective.  What is the probability that the foreman 
forgot to shut off the machine the previous night?   
$PAR
The probability is \{ans_rule(15)\}.
