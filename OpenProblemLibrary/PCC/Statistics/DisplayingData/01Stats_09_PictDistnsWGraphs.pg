#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
For a Physics course containing \(10\) students, 
the maximum point total for the quarter was \(200\).  
The point totals for the \(10\) students are given in the stemplot below. 
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image("Ref_1_5.gif", height=>150, width=>100, tex_size => 200) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
(a)   \{ $mc[$order[0]] -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{$mc[$order[0]] -> print_a() \}

$PAR
(b)   \{ $mc[$order[1]] -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{$mc[$order[1]] -> print_a() \}

$PAR
(c)  The lowest score in the class as a percentage of the total 
    possible points is  \{ans_rule(10)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) Option \(\{$mc[$order[0]] -> correct_ans\}\). $ssols[0]  

$PAR

(b) Option \(\{$mc[$order[1]] -> correct_ans\}\). $ssols[1]

$PAR

(c) As the total points possible is \(200\) and the lowest number of points scored was \(116\), the lowest scores as a percentage is \(\frac{116}{200}\) or \($ans_c\)
