skewed right or symmetric.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Graph \(1\)
$PAR
(a)  Option \($popup1\).  Recall that in general, for a symmetric graph, the mean is near the middle, for a left skewed graph the mean is further to the left and for a right skewed graph the mean is further to the right. 

$PAR

(b) Option \($popup2\).  Recall that for a symmetric graph, the median is near the middle, for a left skewed graph the median is still in the ''middle,'' which may be hard to see, but it will be higher, or larger than the mean.  For a right skewed graph the median is still in the ''middle,'' which may be hard to see, but it will be lower, or smaller than the mean. 

$PAR

(c) The data is \($popup3\).  When skewed left, the tail of the curve extends futher on the left side.  For skewed right, the tail extends further on the right side.  For symmetric, the tail extends about the same amount on both sides.
$PAR
Graph \(2\)
$PAR
(a)  Option \($popup4\)

$PAR

(b) Option \($popup5\)

$PAR

(c) The data is \($popup6\)
