#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the histogram shown below.  
$BR
$BCENTER
\{ image($pic[$choose], height=>300, width=>400, tex_size => 600) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
(a) Is this data skewed to the right, symmetric, or skewed to the left? \{ $popup1->menu() \}
$BR

$PAR
(b) Which is bigger for this data set, the mean or the median, or are they about equal?  \{ $popup2->menu() \}
$BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a) $popup1.  If we were to draw a smooth curve over the histogram, the tail of that curve would go stretch further out to the left hand side than the right side.

$PAR

(b) $popup2.  The small values, potentially outliers, would affect the mean and make it smaller, or drag it to the left graphically.  The median would not be affected and would stay in the middle, making it larger than the mean.
