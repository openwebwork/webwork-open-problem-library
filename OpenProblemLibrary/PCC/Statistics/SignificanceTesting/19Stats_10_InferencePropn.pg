#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A noted psychic was tested for ESP.  The psychic was presented with 
\($n[$choose]\) cards face down and was asked to determine if the card was one of 
\(5\) symbols: a star, cross, circle, square, or three wavy lines.  The psychic 
was correct in \($x[$choose]\) cases.  Let \(p\) represent the probability that 
the psychic correctly identifies the symbol on the card in a random trial.  
Assume the \($n[$choose]\) trials can be treated as an SRS from the population of 
all guesses.

$BR
To see if there is evidence that the psychic is doing better than just 
guessing, we test
$BCENTER
\(  H_0: p = 0.20 \) 
$BR
\(  H_a: p > 0.20 \)
$ECENTER

$PAR
(a) What is the \(z\)-statistic for this test? \(  \)
\{ ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b) What is the \(P\)-value of the test?  \(  \)
\{ ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a)  The psychic was presented with \($n[$choose]\) cards and they guessed the symbol correctly \($x[$choose]\) times.  This means \(\hat{p}\approx$phat\).  Since we know \(p=0.20 \), this means \(q=0.80 \).  Using our formula for \(\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}\), we find that,
$PAR
\(\text{SD}(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{(0.20)(0.80)}{$n[$choose]}} \approx $sigma\)
$PAR
This will allow to us to find our \(z\)-score using \(z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\operatorname{SD}(\hat{p})}\)
$PAR
\(z=\frac{$phat-0.20}{$sigma} \approx $z\).  Therefore our \(z\)-statistic is \($z\).
$PAR
(b) For our \(P\)-value, we will need to use technology.  Since we have \( H_a: p > .20\), we will use one-sided test shaded to the right.  With technology, we obtain \(P\)-value of \($pval\).  The one sided test shading is shown below.
$PAR
