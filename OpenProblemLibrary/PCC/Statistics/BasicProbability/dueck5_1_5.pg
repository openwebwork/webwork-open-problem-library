BEGIN_TEXT
Two six-sided dice are rolled (one red and one green). Some possibilities are (Red=1,Green=5) or (Red=2,Green=2) etc. $PAR
(a) How many total possibilities are there? $BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
For the rest of the questions, we will assume that the dice are fair and
that all of the possibilities in (a) are equally likely. $PAR
(b) What is the probability that the sum on the two dice comes out 
to be $a1?$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(c) What is the probability that the sum on the two dice comes out 
to be $a2? $BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(d) What is the probability that the numbers on the two dice are equal?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
