$PAR 
A survey asks adults to report their marital status.  Suppose that in the city which 
the survey is conducted, $a$PERCENT of adults are married, $b$PERCENT are single, $c$PERCENT 
are divorced, and $i$PERCENT are widowed.  Find the probabilities of each of the following events:
$PAR
The adult is single: \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
The adult is not divorced: \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
The adult is either widowed or divorced: \{ans_rule(15)\}
