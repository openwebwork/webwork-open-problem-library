"In an effort to identify the true proportion of college freshmen 
who are under 18 years of age, a random sample of 
500 freshmen was taken.  Only fifty of them were under the 
age of 18.  The value 0.10 would be used as a point 
estimate to the true proportion of freshmen under the age of 18.",

"The central limit theorem is basic to the concept of 
statistical inference because it permits us to draw 
conclusions about the population based strictly on sample data, 
and without having any knowledge about the 
distribution of the underlying population.",
"T",

"When a great many simple random samples of size \(n\) 
are drawn from a population that is normally distributed, the 
sampling distribution of the sample means will be normal 
regardless of the sample size \(n\).",
"T",

"Recall the rule of thumb used to indicate when the 
normal distribution is a good approximation of the sampling 
distribution for the sample proportion \(\hat{p}\).  
For the combination \(n=50; p=0.05\), the rule is satisfied.",
"F",


"The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the 
sample mean is also called the central limit theorem.",
"F",

"If all possible samples of size \(n\) are drawn from a 
population, the probability distribution of the sample mean 
\(\bar{X}\) is referred to as the normal distribution.",
"F",

"As a general rule, the normal distribution is used to 
approximate the sampling distribution of the sample 
proportion only if the sample size \(n\) is greater than or equal to 30.",
