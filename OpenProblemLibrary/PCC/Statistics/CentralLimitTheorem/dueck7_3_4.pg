Cans of regular Coke are labeled as containing \(12 \mbox{ oz}\). $BR
Statistics students weighted the content of \($n\) randomly chosen cans, and found the mean
weight to be \($mean \mbox{ oz}\). $BR

Assume that cans of Coke are filled so that the actual amounts are normally distributed with a mean of \(12.00 \mbox{ oz}\)
and a standard deviation of \($dev \mbox{ oz}\). Find the probability that a sample of \($n\) cans will 
have a mean amount of at least \($mean \mbox{ oz}\). $BR
