All 60 students watched a 40-minute television program that included ads for Del Taco. Some students saw a 30-second commerical; others a 90-second commerical. The same commerical was shown either 1, 3, or 5 times during the program. After the viewing, each student was asked to rate their craving for Del Taco on a scale of 0 to 10.
