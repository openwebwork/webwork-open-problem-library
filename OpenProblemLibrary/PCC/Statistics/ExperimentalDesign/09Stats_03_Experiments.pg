#  Main

BEGIN_TEXT
One hundred volunteers who suffer from severe depression are available for a study.  Fifty are selected at random 
and are given a new drug that is thought to be particularly effective in treating severe depression. The other fifty 
are given an existing drug for treating severe depression. A psychiatrist evaluates the symptoms of all volunteers 
after four weeks in order to determine if there has been substantial improvement in the severity of the depression.
