BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  Assuming no prior information is known about \(\hat{p}\), we should assume the "worst case" scenario with \(\hat{p}=0.5\) and thus \(\hat{q}=0.5\).  Since we wish to have margin of error \($b\) and $sconf[0] confidence, which corresponds to \(z^{*}\approx$sz[0]\), we can find the needed sample size using the formula, \(\text{MOE} = z^{*}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}\).  
$PAR
Using this we obtain,
$PAR
\($b = $sz[0]\sqrt{\frac{(0.5)(0.5)}{n}}\).  Solving for \(n\), we find \(n=$ans1\).
$PAR 
(b)  Assuming our margin of error and confidence level have not changed, we now also know that \(\hat{p}=$p\) and therefore \(\hat{q}=$q\).  Thus we can use the margin of error formula again to obtain,
$PAR
\($b = $sz[0]\sqrt{\frac{($p)($q)}{n}}\).  Solving for \(n\), we find \(n=$ans2\).
