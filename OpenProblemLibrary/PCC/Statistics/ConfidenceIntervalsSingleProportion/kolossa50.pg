BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  We know that \(\hat{p}=$p\), therefore \(\hat{q}=$q\) and for \( $perc\)$PERCENT we have \(z^{*}\approx $z\).  
$PAR
To create a confidence interval for \(p\) we need the margin of error, which is \(\text{MOE} = z^{*}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}\).  Using this, we obtain,
$PAR 
\(\text{MOE} = $z\sqrt{\frac{($p)($q)}{$n}} \approx $e\).  
$PAR
Therefore, our interval is \($lower < p < $upper\).
$PAR
(b) Option \(C\). This interval was meant to estimate a population proportion, \(p\), this rules out Option \(A\) which is about a sample.  We can also rule out Option \(B\) since we have no ability or right to make a statement about the specific percent chance that \(p\) is in our interval.  However, we are allowed to say we are \(99$PERCENT\) confident the value of \(p\) is in our interval.
