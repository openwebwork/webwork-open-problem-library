BEGIN_TEXT
Astronauts often report that there are times when they become disoriented as they move around in zero-gravity.  Therefore, they usually rely on bright colors and other visual information to help them establish a top-down orientation.  A study was conducted to assess the potential of using color for body orienting.  \($n\) college students, reclining on their backs in the dark, found it difficult to
establish orientation when positioned on under a rotating disk.  This rotating disk was painted half black and half white.  Out of the \($n\) students, \($a\) believed they were right side up when the white was on top.  $PAR
Use this information to estimate the true proportion of subjects who use the white color as a cue for right-side-up orientation.  That is, construct a $sconf[0] confidence interval for the true proportion.  $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  Based on the study we know that of \($n\) students, \($a\) believed they were right side up when the white was on top, meaning \(\hat{p}=$p\) and \(\hat{q}=$q\).  We desire a $sconf[0] confidence interval, which corresponds to \(z^{*}\approx$sz[0]\).  
$PAR
To create a confidence interval for \(p\) we need the margin of error, which is found with the formula \(\text{MOE} = z^{*}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}\).  Using this, we obtain,
$PAR 
\(\text{MOE} = $sz[0]\sqrt{\frac{($p)($q)}{$n}} \approx $moe\).  
$PAR
Therefore, our interval is \($ans1 \leq p \leq $ans2\).
