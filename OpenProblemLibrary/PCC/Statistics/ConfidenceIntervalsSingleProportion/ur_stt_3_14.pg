BEGIN_TEXT

A confidence interval for a population proportion \(p\) has been given. What was the sample proportion and what is the margin of error? $PAR

\[ $min < p < $max \] $PAR

$PAR
margin of error\(= \) \{ans_rule(5)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  As we know our interval in question is \($min < p < $max\), we can find \(\hat{p}\) using symmetry.  A confidence interval is centered at \(\hat{p}\) and then created by finding a margin of error and going the same distance on either side of \(\hat{p}\).  This means that the interval is centered exactly halfway between the lower and upper bounds of the interval.  In our case, this would be \(\hat{p}=\frac{$min+$max}{2} = $p\)
$PAR
(b)  Since we know the center of the our interval is \($p\), this means \(\hat{p}=$p\).  We know that the lower bound of our interval is \(\text{Lower} = \hat{p} -\text{MOE}\).  Using this we obtain,
$PAR
\($min = $p - \text{MOE}\), which can be solved to find \(\text{MOE} = $e\).  Therefore our margin of error is \($e\).
