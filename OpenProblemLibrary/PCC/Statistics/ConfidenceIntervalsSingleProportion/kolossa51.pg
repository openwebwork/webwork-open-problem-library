(a) A random sample of elementary school children in New York state is to be
selected to estimate the proportion \(p\) who have received a medical
examination during the past year.  The survey found that \( x = $x \) children were examined during the past year. Construct the \( $perc\)$PERCENT confidence interval estimate of the population proportion 
\( p \) if the sample size was \( n = $n \) .

BEGIN_SOLUTION

(a)  We know that \(\hat{p}=$p\) and for \($perc\)$PERCENT we have \(z^{*}\approx$z\).  
$PAR
To create a confidence interval for \(p\) we need the margin of error, which is \(\text{MOE} = z^{*}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}\).  Using this, we obtain,
$PAR 
\(\text{MOE} = $z\sqrt{\frac{($p)($q)}{$n}} \approx $e\).  
$PAR
Therefore, our interval is \($lower < p < $upper\).
$PAR
(b) Option \(C\).  This interval was meant to estimate the percent, \(p\), of all elementary school children, this rules out Option \(A\) which is about a sample.  We can also rule out Option \(B\) since we have no ability or right to make a statement about the specific percent chance that \(p\) is in our interval.  However, we are allowed to say we are \(95$PERCENT\) confident the value of \(p\) is in our interval.
