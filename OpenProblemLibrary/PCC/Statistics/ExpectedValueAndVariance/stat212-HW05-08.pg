BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
The owner of a small firm has just purchased a personal computer, which she expects will serve her for the next two years.  The owner has been 
told that she "must" buy a surge suppressor to provide protection for her new hardware against possible surges or variations in the electrical current, which have the capacity to damage the computer.  The amount of damage to the computer 
depends on the strength of the surge.  It has been estimated that there is a \($a1$PERCENT\) chance of incurring \($c1\) dollar damage, \($a2$PERCENT\) chance of incurring \($c2\) dollar damage, and \($a3$PERCENT\) chance of \($c3\) dollar damage.  An inexpensive suppressor, which would provide protection for only one surge, can be purchased.  How much should the owner be willing to pay if she makes decisions on the basis of expected value?
$PAR
The expected cost due to surge damage is \{ans_rule(15)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
We will need a model if we are to find the expected cost due to surge damage.  Don't forget to include the probability that there is $BBOLD NO $EBOLD damage.
