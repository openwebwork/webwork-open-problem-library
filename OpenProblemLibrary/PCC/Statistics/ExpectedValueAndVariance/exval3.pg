BEGIN_TEXT
Mark draws one card from a standard deck of \(52\). He receives \($a\)  for a $res and 
\($b\) for $reart $ref, but \($c\)  for the $ref of $ress. How much could he pay to play this game per draw if he expects to break even in the long run? \{ans_rule(30)\}

END_TEXT

$ans = $a*(12/52)+$b*(3/52)+$c/52;


ANS(Currency($ans)->cmp);

BEGIN_SOLUTION
Using the above situation, we can create a probability model as seen below,
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{begintable(5)\}
\{row("Outcome", "Nothing", "$res", "$reart $ref" , "$ref of $ress")\}
\{row("\(X\)", "$z", "$a", "$b" , "$c")\}
\{row("\(P(X)\)", "\(\frac{36}{52}\)", "\(\frac{12}{52}\)" , "\(\frac{3}{52}\)", "\(\frac{1}{52}\)")\}
\{endtable()\}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Note there are \(13\) $ref\(\)s in a deck, where you win \($a\), but if you pick the $ref of $ress, you win \($c\), thus there are only \(12\) ways to win \($a\).  Similarly, there are \(4\) $reart $ref\(\)s, but if you pick the $ref of $ress, you win \($c\) thus there are only \(3\) ways to win \($b\).
$PAR
Since we want to break even in the long run, whatever the expected value is of winning, we should be willing to pay that much to break even in the long run.  Thus we can find,
$PAR
\(\text{E}(X)=\mu = ($z \cdot \frac{36}{52}) + ($a \cdot \frac{12}{52}) + ($b \cdot \frac{3}{52}) + ($c \cdot \frac{1}{52})=$ans\).  Thus we should be willing to spend \($ans\).
