BEGIN_TEXT

Four buses carrying \($total\) high school students arrive to Montreal. The buses carry, respectively, \($a\), \($b\), \($c\), and \($d\) students. One of the \($total\) students is randomly selected. Let \(X\) denote the number of students that were on the bus carrying this randomly selected student. One of the four bus drivers is also randomly selected. Let \(Y\) denote the number of students on his bus. Compute the expectations and variances of \(X\) and \(Y\):
$PAR
$PAR

\(\operatorname{E}(X)=\)\{ans_rule(30)\} $BR

\(\operatorname{Var}(X)=\)\{ans_rule(30)\} $PAR
$PAR

\(\operatorname{E}(Y)=\)\{ans_rule(30)\} $BR

\(\operatorname{Var}(Y)=\)\{ans_rule(30)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
First we need a probability model, \(X\), for the number of students that were on the bus carrying this randomly selected student.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{begintable(2)\}
\{row("\(X\)", "\($a\)", "\($b\)", "\($c\)", "\($d\)")\}
\{row("\(\text{P}(X)\)", "\(\frac{$a}{$total}\)", "\(\frac{$b}{$total}\)", "\(\frac{$c}{$total}\)", "\(\frac{$d}{$total}\)")\}
\{endtable()\}
$ECENTER
(a) Now with technology we can compute the expected value, or,
$PAR
\(\text{E}(X)=\mu = ($a \cdot \frac{$a}{$total})+ ($b \cdot \frac{$b}{$total}) +($c \cdot \frac{$c}{$total}) + ($d \cdot \frac{$d}{$total}) \approx $ex\)
$PAR
(b)  Using technology we find \(\sigma_{x}\approx $varx\), thus, \(\text{VAR}(X) \approx ($varx)^2 \approx $vx\)
$PAR
Again, we need a probability model, \(Y\), for the number of students that were on the bus carrying this randomly selected driver.  This is made easier since there are only \(4\) drivers, one on each bus, and thus each driver has the same chance of being selected.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{begintable(2)\}
\{row("\(Y\)", "\($a\)", "\($b\)", "\($c\)", "\($d\)")\}
\{row("\(\text{P}(Y)\)", "\(\frac{1}{4}\)", "\(\frac{1}{4}\)", "\(\frac{1}{4}\)", "\(\frac{1}{4}\)")\}
\{endtable()\}
$ECENTER
$PAR
(c) Now with technology we can compute the expected value, or,
$PAR
\(\text{E}(Y)=\mu = ($a \cdot \frac{1}{4})+ ($b \cdot \frac{1}{4}) +($c \cdot \frac{1}{4}) + ($d \cdot \frac{1}{4}) \approx $ey\)
$PAR
(d)  Using technology we find \(\sigma_{x}\approx $vary\), thus, \(\text{VAR}(Y) \approx ($vary)^2 \approx $vy\)
