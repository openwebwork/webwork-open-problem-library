BEGIN_PGML

[$name] purchased [`[$lbs]`] pounds of apples at the total cost of [`[$totalU]`]. If the price doesn't change, how many pounds of apples can [$name] purchase with [`[$total1U]`]?

With [`[$total1U]`], [$name] can purchase [__________]{$lbs1U} of apples.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1:  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the cost of [`[$lbs1]`] pounds of apples, we first need to find the cost of each pound of apples:

    [`` \frac{[$totalU]}{[$lbs]\text{ lb}} = \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ lb}}``]

The unit price of apples is [`[$rateU]`] per pound. 

Next, we cannot do [`[$total1U] \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ lb}} `], because the unit "dollars" will not cancel. Instead, we have to flip the rate [`\frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ lb}}`] and have [`\frac{1 \text{ lb}}{[$rateU]}`].

Next, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$total1U] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ lb}}{[$rateU]} \\
   &=[$total1] \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ lb} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ lb} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rate]} \text{ lb} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{[$rate]} \text{ lb} \\
   &= [$lbs1U]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

With [`[$total1U]`], [$name] can purchase [`[$lbs1U]`] of apples.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [`x \text{ lb}`] of apples can be purchased with [`[$total1U]`].

In the proportion, the top (numerators) have the cost in dollars, and the bottom (denominators) have the weight in pounds. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{cost of apples in dollars}}{\text{amount of apples in lb}} &=\frac{\text{cost of apples in dollars}}{\text{amount of apples in lb}} \\
   \frac{[$totalU]}{[$lbs] \text{ lb}} &= \frac{[$total1U]}{x \text{ lb}} \\
   [$total]x &= [$total1] \cdot [$lbs] \\
   [$total]x &= [$total1*$lbs] \\
   \frac{[$total]x}{[$total]} &= \frac{[$total1*$lbs]}{[$total]} \\
   x &= [$lbs1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

With [`[$total1U]`], [$name] can purchase [`[$lbs1U]`] of apples.
