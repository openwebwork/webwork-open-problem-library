BEGIN_PGML

A restaurant used [`[$totalU]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days]`] days. At this rate, [`[$total1U]`] of oil will last how many days?

The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [_________]{$days1} days.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the amount of vegetable oil used in [`[$days1]`] days, we need to find the amount of oil used every day (rate):

    [`` \frac{[$totalU]}{[$days] \text{ days}} = \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} ``]

On average, the restaurant uses [`[$rateU]`] of vegetable oil per day. 

Note that we cannot do [`[$total1U] \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} `] because the unit "lb" won't cancel. We need to flip the rate from [` \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} `] to [` \frac{1 \text{ day}}{[$rateU]} `].

We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$total1U] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ day}}{[$rateU]} \\
   &= [$total1] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ day}}{[$rate]}  \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]}  \text{ days} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rate]} \text{ days} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{[$rate]} \text{ days} \\
   &= [$days1] \text{ days}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume the restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [`x`] days.

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have the amount of oil used in pounds, and the denominators (bottom) have the number of days. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{lb of oil}}{\text{number of days}} &= \frac{\text{lb of oil}}{\text{number of days}} \\
   \frac{[$totalU]}{[$days] \text{ days}} &= \frac{[$total1U]}{x \text{ days}} \\
   [$total]x &= [$total1] \cdot [$days] \\
   [$total]x &= [$total1*$days] \\
   \frac{[$total]x}{[$total]} &= \frac{[$total1*$days]}{[$total]} \\
   x &= [$days1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.
