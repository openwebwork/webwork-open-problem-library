BEGIN_PGML

[$name] collected a total of [`[$total]`] stamps over the past [`[$years]`] years. At this rate, how many stamps would [$pronoun] collect in [`[$years1]`] years?

At this rate, [$name] would collect [_________]{$total1} stamps in [`[$years1]`] years.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the number of stamps to be collected in [`[$years1]`] years, we need to find the number of stamps collected per year (rate):

    [`` \frac{[$total] \text{ stamps}}{[$years]\text{ years}} = \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}}``]

So, [$name] collected [`[$rate]`] stamps per year. Next, we do:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$years1] \text{ years} \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}} \\
   &= [$years1] \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1} \\
   &= [$years1] \cdot [$rate] \text{ stamps} \\
   &= [$total1] \text{ stamps}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

At this rate, [$name] would collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [`[$years1]`] years.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [$name] would collect [`x`] stamps in [`[$years1]`] years. 

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have the number of stamps collected, and the denominators (bottom) have the number of years. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{number of stamps}}{\text{number of years}} &= \frac{\text{number of stamps}}{\text{number of years}} \\
   \frac{[$total] \text{ stamps}}{[$years] \text{ years}} &= \frac{x \text{ stamps}}{[$years1] \text{ years}} \\
   [$years]x &= [$total] \cdot [$years1] \\
   [$years]x &= [$total*$years1] \\
   \frac{[$years]x}{[$years]} &= \frac{[$total*$years1]}{[$years]} \\
   x &= [$total1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

At this rate, [$name] would collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [`[$years1]`] years.
