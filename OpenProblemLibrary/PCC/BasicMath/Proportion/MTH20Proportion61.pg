BEGIN_PGML

In a city, the owner of a house valued at [`[$value]`] thousand dollars needs to pay [`[$taxU]`] in property tax. At this tax rate, if the owner of a house paid [`[$tax1U]`] of property tax, how much is the house worth?

If the owner of a house paid [`[$tax1U]`] of property tax, the house is worth [_________]{$value1} thousand dollars.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the amount of tax for a [`[$value1]`]-thousand-dollar house, we first need to find the tax rate for each thousand dollars of property value:

    [`` \frac{[$tax]\text{ dollars in tax}}{[$value] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} = \frac{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}}{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}}``]

Next, we cannot do [`[$tax1] \text{ dollars in tax} \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}}{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} `], because the unit "dollars in tax" will not cancel. Instead, we have to flip the rate [`\frac{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}}{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}}`] and have [`\frac{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}}{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}} `].

Next, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$tax1] \text{ dollars in tax} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ thousand dollars in property value}}{[$rate] \text{ dollars in tax}} \\
   &=[$tax1] \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ thousand dollars in property value} \\
   &= \frac{[$tax1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ thousand dollars in property value} \\
   &= \frac{[$tax1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rate]} \text{ thousand dollars in property value} \\
   &= \frac{[$tax1]}{[$rate]} \text{ thousand dollars in property value} \\
   &= [$value1] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If the owner of a house paid [`[$tax1U]`] of property tax, the house is worth [`[$value1]`] thousand dollars.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume that if the owner of a house paid [`[$tax1U]`] of property tax, the house is worth [`x`] thousand dollars.

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have property tax in dollars, and the denominators (bottom) have property value in thousand dollars. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{ dollars in property tax}}{\text{ thousand dollars in property value}} &= \frac{\text{ dollars in property tax}}{\text{ thousand dollars in property value}} \\
   \frac{[$tax] \text{ dollars in property tax}}{[$value] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} &= \frac{[$tax1] \text{ dollars in property tax}}{x \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} \\
   [$tax]x &= [$tax1] \cdot [$value] \\
   [$tax]x &= [$tax1*$value] \\
   \frac{[$tax]x}{[$tax]} &= \frac{[$tax1*$value]}{[$tax]} \\
   x &= [$value1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If the owner of a house paid [`[$tax1U]`] of property tax, the house is worth [`[$value1]`] thousand dollars.
