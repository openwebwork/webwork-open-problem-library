According to a salad recipe, each serving requires [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil and [`[$vinegar1]`] teaspoons of vinegar. If [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil were used, how many teaspoons of vinegar should be used?

If [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil were used, [___________]{$vinegar2} teaspoons of vinegar should be used.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find how many teaspoons of vinegar is needed for [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil, we first need to find how many teaspoons of vinegar is needed for each teaspoon of vegetable oil (rate).

To find this rate, we use the given condition that each serving requires [`[$oil1]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil and [`[$vinegar1]`] teaspoons of vinegar.

    [`` \frac{[$vinegar1] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{[$oil1] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}} = [$rateVO] \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{per teaspoon of vegetable oil}} ``]

The rate is [`[$rateVO] \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{per teaspoon of vegetable oil}}`]. Next, we use the "cancel unit" method:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$oil2] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil} \cdot [$rateVO] \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{per teaspoon of vegetable oil}} \\
   &= [$oil2] \cdot [$rateVO] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \\
   &= \frac{[$oil2]}{1} \cdot [$rateVO] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \\
   &= \frac{[$oil2] \cdot [$rateVONum]}{1 \cdot [$rateVODen]} \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \\
   &= \frac{[$oil2*$rateVONum]}{[$rateVODen]} \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} \\
   &= [$vinegar2] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar} 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil were used, [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar should be used.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume if [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil were used, [`x`] teaspoons of vinegar should be used. 

In the proportion, the top (numerators) have the number of teaspoons of vinegar, and the bottom (denominators) have the number of teaspoons of vegetable oil. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}} &= \frac{\text{teaspoons of vinegar}}{\text{teaspoons of vegetable oil}} \\
   \frac{[$vinegar1] \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{[$oil1] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}} &= \frac{x \text{ teaspoons of vinegar}}{[$oil2] \text{ teaspoons of vegetable oil}} \\
   [$oil1]x &= [$vinegar1] \cdot [$oil2] \\
   [$oil1]x &= [$vinegar1*$oil2] \\
   \frac{[$oil1]x}{[$oil1]} &= \frac{[$vinegar1*$oil2]}{[$oil1]} \\
   x &= [$vinegar2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If [`[$oil2]`] teaspoons of vegetable oil were used, [`[$vinegar2]`] teaspoons of vinegar should be used.
