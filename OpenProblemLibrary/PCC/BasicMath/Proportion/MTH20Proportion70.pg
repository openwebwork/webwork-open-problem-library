BEGIN_PGML

A restaurant used [`[$totalU]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days]`] days. At this rate, how many pounds of vegetable oil will be used in [`[$days1]`] days?

The restaurant will use [_________]{$total1U} of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use rate to solve this problem. To find the amount of vegetable oil used in [`[$days1]`] days, we need to find the amount of oil used every day (rate):

    [`` \frac{[$totalU]}{[$days] \text{ days}} = \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} ``]

On average, the restaurant uses [`[$rateU]`] of vegetable oil per day. Next, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$days1] \text{ days} \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} \\
   &= [$days1] \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 } \\
   &= [$days1] \cdot [$rateU] \\
   &= [$total1U]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.

####Method 2  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume the restaurant will use [`x`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have the amount of oil used in pounds, and the denominators (bottom) have the number of days. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{\text{lb of oil}}{\text{number of days}} &= \frac{\text{lb of oil}}{\text{number of days}} \\
   \frac{[$totalU]}{[$days] \text{ days}} &= \frac{x \text{ lb}}{[$days1] \text{ days}} \\
   [$days]x &= [$total] \cdot [$days1] \\
   [$days]x &= [$total*$days1] \\
   \frac{[$days]x}{[$days]} &= \frac{[$total*$days1]}{[$days]} \\
   x &= [$total1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.
