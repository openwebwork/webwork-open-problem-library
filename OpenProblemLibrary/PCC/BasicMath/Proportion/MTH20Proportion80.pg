BEGIN_PGML

A biologist wants to estimate the number of fish living in a lake. She caught [`[$a]`] fish, tagged each one, and then released them back into the lake. After a few days, she caught [`[$d]`] fish, and found that [`[$c]`] of them were tagged. Use a proportion to estimate the number of fish living in this lake.
     
    There are approximately [__________]{$ans} fish living in the lake.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume the there are approximately [`x`] fish living in the lake.

In the proportion, the numerators (top) have tagged fish, and the denominators (bottom) have both tagged and untagged fish. In other words, we have:

    [`` \frac{\text{all tagged fish in the lake}}{\text{all fish in the lake}} = \frac{\text{tagged fish out of [$d] caught fish}}{\text{[$d] caught fish}} ``]

Now we can set up and solve a proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$a]}{x} &= \frac{[$c]}{[$d]} \\
   [$c]x &= [$d]\cdot[$a] \\
   [$c]x &= [$d*$a] \\
   \frac{[$c]x}{[$c]} &= \frac{[$d*$a]}{[$c]}  \\
   x &\approx [$b]... \\
   x &\approx [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

There are approximately [`[$ans]`] fish living in the lake.
