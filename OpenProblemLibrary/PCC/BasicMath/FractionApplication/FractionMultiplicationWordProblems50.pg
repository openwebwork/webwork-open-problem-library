BEGIN_PGML

[`[$pop0]`] moths lived in a lab. Each week, some moths died, and about [`[$frac]`] survived. How many moths were still alive after [`2`] weeks?

About [_________]{$pop2} moths were still alive after [`2`] weeks.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

There are [`[$pop0]`] moths originally. It's given that [`[$frac]`] of [`[$pop0]`] survived after one week. To find the number of surviving moths, we use multiplication:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$pop0] \cdot [$frac]
      &= \frac{[$pop0]}{1} \cdot [$frac] \\
      &= \frac{[$pop0/$den1]}{1} \cdot \frac{[$num1]}{1} \\
      &= \frac{[$pop0/$den1]\cdot[$num1]}{1} \\
      &= [$pop1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

So [`[$pop1]`] moths survived after 1 week. To find the number of survivors after another week, we do the same calculation:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$pop1] \cdot [$frac]
      &= \frac{[$pop1]}{1} \cdot [$frac] \\
      &= \frac{[$pop1/$den1]}{1} \cdot \frac{[$num1]}{1} \\
      &= \frac{[$pop1/$den1]\cdot[$num1]}{1} \\
      &= [$pop2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

About [`[$pop2]`] moths were still alive after [`2`] weeks.

It can be simpler to use the following shortcut to do fraction multiplication:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$pop0] \cdot [$frac]
      &= [$pop0] \div [$den1] \cdot [$num1] \\
      &= [$pop0/$den1] \cdot [$num1] \\
      &= [$pop1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

And:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$pop1] \cdot [$frac]
      &= [$pop1] \div [$den1] \cdot [$num1] \\
      &= [$pop1/$den1] \cdot [$num1] \\
      &= [$pop2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Note that this shortcut only works when the denominator divides into the whole number.
