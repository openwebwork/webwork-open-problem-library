Answer the following questions.

a.    In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of male students in this class was [__________]{$meanMale}.

a.    In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of female students in this class was [__________]{$meanFemale}.

a.    In these [`4`] terms, the median of male students in this class was [__________]{$medianMale}.

a.    In these [`4`] terms, the median of female students in this class was [__________]{$medianFemale}.

a.    If you want to know, in all [`4`] terms, there are more male or female students, should you compare the mean or median?

a.

To find the mean number of male students in this class, we first add up the number of male students in all [`4`] terms:

    [`` [@$numMale[0]@] + [@$numMale[1]@] + [@$numMale[2]@] + [@$numMale[3]@] = [$totalMale] ``]

Now we can find the mean by dividing the sum by the number of terms ([`4`]):

    [`` \text{mean} = \frac{[$totalMale]}{4} = [$meanMale] ``]

In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of male students in this class was [`[$meanMale]`].

b.

To find the mean number of female students in this class, we first add up the number of female students in all [`4`] terms:

    [`` [@$numFemale[0]@] + [@$numFemale[1]@] + [@$numFemale[2]@] + [@$numFemale[3]@] = [$totalFemale] ``]

Now we can find the mean by dividing the sum by the number of terms ([`4`]):

    [`` \text{mean} = \frac{[$totalFemale]}{4} = [$meanFemale] ``]

In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of female students in this class was [`[$meanFemale]`].

c. 

To find the median number of male students, we first need to order the number of male students in all [`4`] terms:

    [$orderedMale]

[$outputM]

In these [`4`] terms, the median of male students in this class was [`[$medianMale]`].

d.

To find the median number of female students, we first need to order the number of female students in all [`4`] terms:

    [$orderedFemale]

[$outputF]

In these [`4`] terms, the median of female students in this class was [`[$medianFemale]`].

e.

To compare the total number of male and female students in all [`4`] terms, we should compare the mean. The median is not accurate because some numbers were not considered; as a comparison, each number is used when the mean is calculated.

[$output1]

Don't think that the median is not useful. When there are outliers (very big or small numbers compared to most numbers in the group), the median is better than mean. That's why in newspapers, you will more than likely see "the median house price" than "the mean house price," etc.
