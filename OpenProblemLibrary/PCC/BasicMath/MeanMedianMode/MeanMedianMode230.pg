This bar graph compares commuter and residential student enrollment in a
certain class at a college in a certain school year.

>>[! [$alttext] !]{$graph_image}{600} <<


Answer the following questions.

*Question 1:* In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of commuter students in
this class was [__________]{$meanA}.

*Question 2:* In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of residential students
in this class was [__________]{$meanB}.

*Question 3:* In these [`4`] terms, the median of commuter students in this
class was [__________]{$medianA}.

*Question 4:* In these [`4`] terms, the median of residential students in
this class was [__________]{$medianB}.

*Question 5:* If you want to know, in all [`4`] terms, there are more commuter
or residential students, should you compare the mean or median?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a.

To find the mean number of commuter students in this class, we first
add up the number of commuter students in all [`4`] terms:

    [`` [@$numA[0]@] + [@$numA[1]@] + [@$numA[2]@] + [@$numA[3]@] = [$totalA] ``]

Now we can find the mean by dividing the sum by the number of terms ([`4`]):

    [`` \text{mean} = \frac{[$totalA]}{4} = [$meanA] ``]

*Solution:* In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of commuter students
in this class was [`[$meanA]`].

b.

To find the mean number of residential students in this class, we first
add up the number of residential students in all [`4`] terms:

    [`` [@$numB[0]@] + [@$numB[1]@] + [@$numB[2]@] + [@$numB[3]@] = [$totalB] ``]

Now we can find the mean by dividing the sum by the number of terms ([`4`]):

    [`` \text{mean} = \frac{[$totalB]}{4} = [$meanB] ``]

*Solution:* In these [`4`] terms, the mean number of residential
students in this class was [`[$meanB]`].

----

####Question 3

To find the median number of commuter students, we first need to order the
number of commuter students in all [`4`] terms:

    [$orderedA]

*Solution:* In these [`4`] terms, the median of commuter students in this
class was [`[$medianA]`].

----

####Question 4

To find the median number of residential students, we first need to order
the number of residential students in all [`4`] terms:

    [$orderedB]

[$outputF]

*Solution:* In these [`4`] terms, the median of residential students in this
class was [`[$medianB]`].

----

####Question 5

To compare the total number of commuter and residential students in all
[`4`] terms, we should compare the mean. The median is not accurate because
some numbers were not considered; as a comparison, each number is used
when the mean is calculated.

[$output1]

Don't think that the median is not useful. When there are outliers (very
big or small numbers compared to most numbers in the group), the median
is better than mean. That's why in newspapers, you will more than likely
see 'the median house price' than 'the mean house price,' etc.
