BEGIN_PGML

[$name] just bought a total of [`[$total]`] movies. [@ucfirst($pronoun)@] will watch [`[$weekly]`] movies every week. In how many weeks will [$name] finish watching all the movies?

Solution: [$name] will finish watching all movies in [__________]{$weeks} weeks.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Division is used when a number of objects are divided evenly into groups. Division is also used in situations where we "repeatedly subtract".

We could do this problem by subtracting [`[$weekly]`] repeatedly from [`[$total]`]. However, it's easier to do:

    [`` [$total] \div [$weekly] = [$weeks] ``]

*Solution:* [$name] will finish watching all the movies in [`[$weeks]`] weeks.

We should get used to using the fraction line instead of the division symbol:

    [`` \frac{[$total]}{[$weekly]}=[$weeks] ``]
