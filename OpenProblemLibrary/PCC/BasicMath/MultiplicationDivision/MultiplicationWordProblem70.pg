BEGIN_PGML

A queen termite produces [`[$numPerMinute]`] eggs every minute. How many eggs does the queen produce every week?

The queen termite produces [__________]{$numPerWeek} eggs every week.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It's given that the queen termite produces [`[$numPerMinute]`] eggs every minute. There are [`60`] minutes in an hour, so the queen termite can produce [` [$numPerMinute] \cdot 60 = [$numPerHour] `] eggs in an hour.

There are [`24`] hours in a day, so the queen termite can produce [` [$numPerHour] \cdot 24 = [$numPerDay] `] eggs in a day.

There are [`7`] days in a week, so the queen termite can produce [` [$numPerDay] \cdot 7 = [$numPerWeek] `] eggs in a week.

The queen termite can produce [` [$numPerWeek] `] eggs in a week.

We could have done this problem in one line:

    [`` [$numPerMinute] \cdot 60 \cdot 24 \cdot 7 = [$numPerWeek] ``]
