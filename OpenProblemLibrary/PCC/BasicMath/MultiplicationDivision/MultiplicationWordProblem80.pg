TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] plays in [$possessive] school's basketball team. Last season, [$name] scored an average of [`[$numPerGame]`] points per game. The season had a total of [`[$numGamesTotal]`] games, but [$name] missed [`[$numGamesMissed]`] games. How many points did [$name] score in total last season?

[$name] scored a total of [___________]{$totalPoints} points last season.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Out of [`[$numGamesTotal]`] games last season, [$name] missed [`[$numGamesMissed]`] games. This implies [$pronoun] played a total of [`[$numGamesTotal]-[$numGamesMissed]=[$numGamesPlayed]`] games.

On average, [$name] scored [`[$numPerGame]`] points per game. To find the total number of points [$name] scored, we do multiplication:

    [`` [$numPerGame] \cdot [$numGamesPlayed] = [$totalPoints] ``]

[$name] scored a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points last season.

We could have done this problem with one math expression:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}
   [$numPerGame] \cdot ([$numGamesTotal]-[$numGamesMissed]) 
      &= [$numPerGame] \cdot [$numGamesPlayed] \\
      &= [$totalPoints]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
