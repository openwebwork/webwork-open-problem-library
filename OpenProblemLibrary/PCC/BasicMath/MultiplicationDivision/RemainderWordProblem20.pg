TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] saved [`[$totalU]`], and will start spending [$possessive] money on Lego figures. Each week, [$name] will spend [`[$weeklySpendingU]`] to buy a Lego figure. For how many weeks can [$name] spend [$possessive] money this way? How much left-over money will [$pronoun] have?

*Solution: *

[$name] can spend [$possessive] money this way for [__________]{$weeks} weeks.

There will be [__________]{$remainderU} of left-over money.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Division is used when a number of objects are divided evenly into groups. Division is also used in situations where we "repeatedly subtract".

We could do this problem by subtracting [`[$weeklySpendingU]`] repeatedly from [`[$totalU]`]. However, it's easier to do:

    [`` [$total] \div [$weeklySpending] [$symbol] [$s1] ``]

The decimal quotient [`[$s1]`] implies [`[$weeklySpending]`] doesn't go into [`[$total]`] evenly, so [$name] will have some left-over money.

To find the amount of left-over money, notice that the integer part of [`[$s1]`] is [`[$weeks]`]. This implies [$name] can keep spending [$possessive] money for a total of [`[$weeks]`] weeks, for a total of [`[$weeklySpendingU]\cdot[$weeks]=[$s2U]`].

Once [`[$s2U]`] out of [`[$totalU]`] is spent, there are [`[$totalU]-[$s2U]=[$remainderU]`] left.

Now we can rewrite the division expression as:

    [`` [$total] \div [$weeklySpending] = [$weeks] \text{ R } [$remainder] ``]


[$name] can spend money this way for [`[$weeks]`] weeks.

[@ucfirst($pronoun)@] will have [`[$remainderU]`] left.
