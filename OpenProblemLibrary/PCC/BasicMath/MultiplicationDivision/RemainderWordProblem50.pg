BEGIN_PGML

A teacher is doing an activity in a class with [`[$numStudents]`] students. The teacher had a total of [`[$total]`] marbles, and handed them out evenly among all students until not enough marbles are left for another round. Some marbles were left over, and the teacher divided those left-over marbles evenly into [`[$numPiles]`] piles.

How many marbles are in each pile?

There are [_________]{$eachPile} marbles in each pile.

END_PGML

$s1 = $total/$numStudents;
if ($s1*100!=int($s1*100)) {
   $s1 =  sprintf("%.2f",$s1);
   $symbol = "\approx";
} else {
   $symbol = "=";
}
$s2 = $eachStudent*$numStudents;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

First, we divide [`[$total]`] marbles evenly among [`[$numStudents]`] students, and we have:

    [`` [$total] \div [$numStudents] [$symbol] [$s1] ``]

The decimal quotient implies [`[$numStudents]`] doesn't go into [`[$total]`] evenly, so there will be left-over marbles.

Notice that the integer part of [`[$s1]`] is [`[$eachStudent]`]. This implies each student will get [`[$eachStudent]`] marbles.

If each student gets [`[$eachStudent]`] marbles, [`[$numStudents]`] students will get [` [$eachStudent] \cdot [$numStudents] = [$s2] `] marbles.

Once [`[$s2]`] marbles out of [`[$total]`] were handed out, there will be [`[$total]-[$s2]=[$remainder]`] left-over marbles.

We can re-write the division equation as:

    [`` [$total] \div [$numStudents] = [$eachStudent] \text{ R } [$remainder] ``]

The character *R* represents "remainder".

Next, the teacher divided [`[$remainder]`] left-over marbles evenly into [`[$numPiles]`] piles. We have:

    [`` [$remainder] \div [$numPiles] = [$eachPile] ``]

There are [`[$eachPile]`] marbles in each pile.
