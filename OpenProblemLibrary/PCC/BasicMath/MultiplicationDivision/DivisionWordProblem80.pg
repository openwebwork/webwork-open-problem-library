TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] is a star player in [$possessive] basketball team. Last season, [$name] scored a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points in the whole season. The season had a total of [`[$numGamesTotal]`] games, but [$name] missed [`[$numGamesMissed]`] games. On average, how many points did [$name] score in each game?

On average, [$name] scored [___________]{$numPerGame} points in each game.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Out of [`[$numGamesTotal]`] games last season, [$name] missed [`[$numGamesMissed]`] games. This implies [$pronoun] played a total of [`[$numGamesTotal]-[$numGamesMissed]=[$numGamesPlayed]`] games.

It's given [$name] scored a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points in the season. To find the average number of points per game, we divide the total number of points [$name] scored by the number of games [$name] played:

    [``  [$totalPoints] \div [$numGamesPlayed] = [$numPerGame]``]

On average, [$name] scored [`[$numPerGame]`] points in each game.

We could have done this problem with one math expression:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}
   [$totalPoints] \div ([$numGamesTotal]-[$numGamesMissed]) 
      &= [$totalPoints] \div [$numGamesPlayed] \\
      &= [$numPerGame]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
