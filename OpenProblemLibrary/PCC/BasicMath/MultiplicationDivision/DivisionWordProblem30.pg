TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] saved [`[$totalU]`], and will start spending [$possessive] money on Lego figures. Each week, [$name] will spend [`[$weeklySpendingU]`] to buy a Lego figure. In how many weeks will [$name] have spent all [$possessive] money?

[$name] will have spent all [$possessive] money in [__________]{$weeks} weeks.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Division is used when a number of objects are divided evenly into groups. Division is also used in situations where we "repeatedly subtract".

We could do this problem by subtracting [`[$weeklySpendingU]`] repeatedly from [`[$totalU]`]. However, it's easier to do:

    [`` [$total] \div [$weeklySpending] = [$weeks] ``]

[$name] will spend all [$possessive] money in [`[$weeks]`] weeks.

We should get used to using the fraction line instead of the division symbol:

    [`` \frac{[$total]}{[$weeklySpending]}=[$weeks] ``]
