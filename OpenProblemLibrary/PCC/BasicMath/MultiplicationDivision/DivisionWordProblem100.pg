TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

An archeology team is studying a buried city. The team can cover [`[$rate]`] square meters every day. The whole area covers about [`[$total]`] square meters. How many days will it take the team to complete studying the whole area?

It would take the team [____________]{$days} days to cover the whole area.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We can address this problem as "repeatedly taking away [`[$rate]`] square meters from [`[$total]`] square meters," which implies a division problem:

    [`` [$total] \div [$rate] = [$days] ``]

It would take the team [`[$days]`] days to cover the whole area.

We should get used to using the fraction line instead of the division symbol:

    [`` \frac{[$total]}{[$rate]}=[$days] ``]
