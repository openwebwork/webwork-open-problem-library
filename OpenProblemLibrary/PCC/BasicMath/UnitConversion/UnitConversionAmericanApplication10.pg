A team of geologists are observing a sink hole in a remote area. When they arrived at the scene, the hole was [`[$ft]`] feet deep. Three days later, the hole sank [`[$in]`] inches further. How deep was the sink hole three days later? Answer this question first in inches, and then in feet.

a. The sink hole was [__________]{$ansIn} [`` \text{ inches} ``] deep three days later.

b. The sink hole was [__________]{$ansFt} [`` \text{ feet} ``] deep three days later. Use fractions in your answer. Don't use decimal.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use the formula [` 1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches} `].

*Part a:* We need to change [`[$ft]`] feet into inches:

    [`` [$ft] \text{ ft} = [$ft] \cdot 12 \text{ in} = [$ft*12] \text{ in} ``]

Next, we add up the distances:

    [`` [$ft*12] \text{ in} + [$in] \text{ in} = [$ansIn] \text{ in} ``]

The sink hole was [`[$ansIn]`] [`` \text{ inches} ``] deep three days later.

*Part b:* We need to change [`[$in]`] inches into feet:

    [`` [$in] \text{ in} = \frac{[$in]}{12} \text{ ft} = [$frac] \text{ ft} ``]

Next, we add up the distances:

    [`` [$frac] \text{ ft} + [$ft] \text{ ft} = [$ansFt] \text{ ft} ``]

The sink hole was [`[$ansFt]`] [`` \text{ feet} ``] deep three days later.
