Hill A is [`[$kmA]`] kilometers in height, while Hill B is [`[$mB]`] meters in height. What is the difference in their height? Answer this question in both meters and kilometers.

a. The difference in these two hills' height is [_________]{$ansM} meters.

b. The difference in these two hills' height is [_________]{$ansKm} kilometers. Use decimal in your answer.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use the formula [` 1 \text{ kilometer} = 1000 \text{ meters} `].

*Part a:* We need to change Hill A's height from [`[$kmA]`] kilometers to meters:

    [`` [$kmA] \text{ km} = [$kmA] \cdot 1000 \text{ m} = [$mA] \text{ m} ``]

Next, we find their difference in height by subtraction:

    [`` [$mA] \text{ m} - [$mB] \text{ m} = [$ansM] \text{ m} ``]

The difference in these two hills' height is [`[$ansM]`] meters.

*Part b:* We need to change Hill B's height from [`[$mB]`] meters to kilometers:

    [`` [$mB] \text{ m} = [$mB] \div 1000 \text{ km} = [$kmB] \text{ km} ``]

Next, we find their difference in height by subtraction:

    [`` [$kmA] \text{ km} - [$kmB] \text{ km} = [$ansKm] \text{ km} ``]

The difference in these two hills' height is [`[$ansKm]`] kilometers.
