BEGIN_PGML

A mountain grows by [`[$eachCM]`] centimeters every year. At this rate, in how many years will the mountain grow by [`[$totalM]`] meters?

The mountain will grow by [`[$totalM]`] meters in [__________]{$years} years.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use the formula [` 1 \text{ meter} = 100 \text{ centimeters} `].

This is a division problem. However, before we do division, we have to convert numbers to the same units.

####Solution 1:

We will change the yearly growth rate from [`[$eachCM]`] centimeters to meters:

    [`` [$eachCM] \text{ cm} = [$eachCM] \div 100 \text{ m} = [$eachM] \text{ m} ``]

Next, we use division to find the number of years it will take the mountain to grow by [`[$totalM]`] meters:

    [`` [$totalM] \text{ m} \div [$eachM] \text{ m} = [$years] \text{ years} ``]

The mountain will grow by [`[$totalM]`] meters in [`[$years]`] years.

####Solution 2:

We will change the total growth from [`[$totalM]`] meters to centimeters:

    [`` [$totalM] \text{ m} = [$totalM] \cdot 100 \text{ cm} = [$totalCM] \text{ cm} ``]

Next, we use division to find the number of years it will take the mountain to grow by [`[$totalM]`] meters:

    [`` [$totalCM] \text{ cm} \div [$eachCM] \text{ cm} = [$years] \text{ years} ``]

The mountain will grow by [`[$totalM]`] meters in [`[$years]`] years.
