BEGIN_PGML

It's given that [` 1 \text{ pound (lb)} = 16 \text{ ounces (oz)} `].

A baker owns a small business. He produces bread in bags. Each bag needs [`[$eachOz]`] oz of dough. The baker purchased [`[$totalLb]`] lb of dough. How many bags of bread can be produced?

The baker can produce [__________]{$num} bags of bread with [`[$totalLb]`] lb of dough.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Note that we cannot do [` [$totalLb] \text{ lb} \div [$eachOz] \text{ oz} `], because the units don't match. We have to change [`[$totalLb]`] lb to oz first:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$totalLb] \text{ lb}
      &= [$totalLb] \cdot 16 \text{ oz} \\
      &= [$totalOz] \text{ oz}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Now we can do division:

    [`` [$totalOz] \text{ oz} \div [$eachOz] \text{ oz} = [$num] ``]

The baker can produce [`[$num]`] bags of bread with [`[$totalLb]`] lb of dough.
