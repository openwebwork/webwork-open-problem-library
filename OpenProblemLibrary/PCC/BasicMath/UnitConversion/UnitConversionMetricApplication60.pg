BEGIN_PGML

A chemistry teacher will order saline for a lab lesson for the upcoming school year. Each experiment will use [`[$eachMl]`] milliliters of saline, and approximately [`[$num]`] experiments will be conducted in this school year. How many liters of saline should the teacher order?

The teacher should order [_________]{$totalL} liters of saline for the school year.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use this formula:

    [`` 1 \text{ liter} = 1000 \text{ milliliters} ``]

It's given [`[$eachMl]`] milliliters of saline will be used in each experiment. We use multiplication to find the total amount of saline to be used in [`[$num]`] experiments:

    [`` [$eachMl] \text{ ml} \cdot [$num] = [$totalMl] \text{ ml} ``]

Next, we need to convert the result from milliliters to liters:

    [`` [$totalMl] \text{ ml} = [$totalMl] \div 1000 \text{ l} = [$totalL] \text{ l} ``]

The teacher should order [`[$totalL]`] liters of saline for the school year.
