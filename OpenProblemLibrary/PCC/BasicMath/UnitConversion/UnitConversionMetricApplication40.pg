A mountain moves toward the west by [`[$eachMM]`] millimeters per year. In the past [`[$yearsM]`] million years, how many kilometers did the mountain move toward the west?

The mountain moved to the west by [__________]{$totalKM} kilometers in [`[$yearsM]`] million years.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use these formulas:

    [`` 1 \text{ meter} = 1000 \text{ millimeters} ``]

    [`` 1 \text{ kilometer} = 1000 \text{ meters} ``]

First, we use multiplication to find the total number of millimeters the mountain moved toward the west in [`[$yearsM]`] million years:

    [`` [$eachMM] \frac{\text{mm}}{\text{year}} \cdot [$years] \text{ years} = [$totalMM] \text{ mm} ``]

Next, we need to convert the result from millimeters to kilometers. We first convert it to meters:

    [`` [$totalMM] \text{ mm} = [$totalMM] \div 1000 \text{ m} = [$totalMM/1000] \text{ m} ``]

Next, we convert meters to kilometers:

    [`` [$totalMM/1000] \text{ m} = [$totalMM/1000] \div 1000 \text{ km} = [$totalKM] \text{ km} ``]

The mountain moved to the west by [`[$totalKM]`] kilometers in [`[$yearsM]`] million years.
