BEGIN_PGML

[$name] sells cars for a living. Each month, [$pronoun] earns [`[$baseC]`] of base pay, plus [`[$per]%`] of commission from [$possessive] sales.

One month, [$name] earned a total of [`[$ansC]`], including base pay and commission. How much in sales did [$name] make in that month?

[$name] made [_________]{$wholeC} in sales in that month.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

[$name]'s pay is made up of base pay and commission. It's given that [$possessive] total pay was [`[$ansC]`], and [$possessive] base pay was [`[$baseC]`]. This implies [$possessive] commission was [`[$ansC]-[$baseC]=[$partC]`].

The commission [`[$partC]`] is [` [$per]% `] of [$possessive] total sales. To find the amount of total sales, it boils down to this question: [`[$partC]`] is [` [$per]% `] of what? We will show multiple methods to solve this problem.

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of [` x `], so "[`[$per]`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$part]`] out of [`x`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$per]}{100} &= \frac{[$part]}{x} \\
   [$per]x &= 100 \cdot [$part] \\
   [$per]x &= [$part*100] \\
   \frac{[$per]x}{[$per]} &= \frac{[$part*100]}{[$per]} \\
   x &= [$whole]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

[$name] made [`[$wholeC]`] in sales in that month.

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem. This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \iff 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

The question is: [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of what? Assume [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of [`x`]. We have:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}
        [$part]  & = [$dec] \cdot x \\
        \frac{[$part]}{[$dec]} & = \frac{[$dec]x}{[$dec]} \\
        [$whole] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

[$name] made [`[$wholeC]`] in sales in that month.

####Method 3  

In the sentence "[`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of what,"

* [`[$part]`] is the *percentage*,
* [` [$per]% `] is the *rate*,
* "what" is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} `], we do a division to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} = \frac{[$part]}{[$per]%} = \frac{[$part]}{[$per/100]} = [$whole] ``]

[$name] made [`[$wholeC]`] in sales in that month.
