BEGIN_PGML

A company's stock value (per share) dropped by [`[$decreaseC]`], and its current value is [`[$newC]`]. What is the percentage decrease of the stock's value?

The percentage decrease in the stock's value was [________]{$ans}.

$s1 = $new/$original;
$s2 = $s1*100;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To calculate the percentage increase/decrease, first we find the amount of decrease/decrease, and then we find this increase/decrease is what percent of the original value.

In this problem, the amount of decrease is given as [`[$decreaseC]`].

To find the stock's value per share before the decrease happened, we can add up its current value and the amount of decrease: [`[$newC]+[$decreaseC]=[$originalC]`].

Next, we need to find: [`[$decreaseC]`] is what percent of the original value, [`[$originalC]`].

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem.

Assume [`[$decrease]`] is [`x%`] of [` [$original] `], so "[`x`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$decrease]`] out of [`[$original]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{100} &= \frac{[$decrease]}{[$original]} \\
   [$original]x &= [$decrease] \cdot 100 \\
   [$original]x &= [$decrease*100] \\
   \frac{[$original]x}{[$original]} &= \frac{[$decrease*100]}{[$original]} \\
   x &= [$per]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The percentage decrease in the stock's value was [`[$per]%`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem.

This translation from English to may  should help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \Longleftrightarrow 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

Let the decrease [`[$decrease]`] be [`x`] (as a percent) of [`[$original]`]. That means:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$decrease]   &= x \cdot [$original] \\
  \frac{[$decrease]}{[$original]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$original]}{[$original]} \\
  [$dec]       & =  x \\
  [$per]%       & =  x \\
\end{aligned}
`]

The percentage decrease in the stock's value was [`[$per]%`].

####Method 3  

We first divide the "new number" by the "original number":

    [`` \frac{[$new]}{[$original]} = [$s1] = [$s2]% ``]

So the new number is [`[$s2]%`] of the original number, implying the percentage decrease is [` 100% - [$s2]% = [$per]% `].

The percentage decrease in the stock's value was [`[$per]%`].
