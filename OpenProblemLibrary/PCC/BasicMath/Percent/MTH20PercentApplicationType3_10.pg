BEGIN_PGML

In the past few seasons' basketball games, [$name] made [` [$per]% `] of his free throw attempts. If [$pronoun] made [`[$part]`] free throws, how many free throws did [$pronoun] attempt?

In the past few seasons, [$name] attempted a total of [___________]{$whole} free throws.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

This problem can be boiled down to this question: [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of what? We will show multiple methods to solve this problem.

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of [` x `], so "[`[$per]`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$part]`] out of [`x`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$per]}{100} &= \frac{[$part]}{x} \\
   [$per]x &= 100 \cdot [$part] \\
   [$per]x &= [$part*100] \\
   \frac{[$per]x}{[$per]} &= \frac{[$part*100]}{[$per]} \\
   x &= [$whole]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the past few seasons, [$name] attempted a total of [`[$whole]`] free throws.

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem. This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \iff 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

The question is: [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of what? Assume [`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of [`x`]. We have:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}
        [$part]  & = [$dec] \cdot x \\
        \frac{[$part]}{[$dec]} & = \frac{[$dec]x}{[$dec]} \\
        [$whole] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In the past few seasons, [$name] attempted a total of [`[$whole]`] free throws.

####Method 3  

In the sentence "[`[$part]`] is [` [$per]% `] of what,"

* [`[$part]`] is the *percentage*,
* [` [$per]% `] is the *rate*,
* "what" is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} `], we do a division to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} = \frac{[$part]}{[$per]%} = \frac{[$part]}{[$per/100]} = [$whole] ``]

In the past few seasons, [$name] attempted a total of [`[$whole]`] free throws.
