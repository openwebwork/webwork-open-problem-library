TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

After a [`[$per]%`] increase, a town has [`[$new]`] people. What was the population before the increase?

    Before the increase, the town's population was [_______]{$ans}.

END_PGML

$s1 = ($per+100)/100;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The town's original population corresponds to [`100%`]. It's given that the population increased by [`[$per]%`]. This implies the town's new population is [`100%+[$per]%=[$per+100]% `] of the original population.

Now, this problem can be boiled down to this question: [`[$new]`] is [` [$per+100]% `] of what? We will show multiple methods to solve this problem.

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [` [$per+100]% `] of [` x `] is [`[$total]`], so "[`[$per+100]`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$new]`] out of [`x`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$per+100]}{100} &= \frac{[$new]}{x} \\
   [$per+100]x &= 100 \cdot [$new] \\
   [$per+100]x &= [$new*100] \\
   \frac{[$per+100]x}{[$per+100]} &= \frac{[$new*100]}{[$per+100]} \\
   x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The town's original population was [`[$ans]`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem. This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \iff 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

The question is: [`[$new]`] is [` [$per+100]% `] of what? Assume [`[$new]`] is [` [$per+100]% `] of [`x`]. We have:

    [`` 
\begin{aligned}
        [$new]  & = [$dec+1] \cdot x \\
        \frac{[$new]}{[$dec+1]} & = \frac{[$dec+1]x}{[$dec+1]} \\
        [$new] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The town's original population was [`[$ans]`].

####Method 3  

In the sentence "[`[$new]`] is [` [$per+100]% `] of what,"

* [`[$new]`] is the *percentage*,
* [` [$per+100]% `] is the *rate*,
* "what" is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} `], we do a division to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{base} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{rate}} = \frac{[$new]}{[$per+100]%} = \frac{[$new]}{[$s1]} = [$ans] ``]

The town's original population was [`[$ans]`].
