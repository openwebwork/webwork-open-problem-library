BEGIN_PGML

A bottle of [`[$per]%`] alcohol solution weighs [`[$whole]`] grams. How many grams of pure alcohol is in this bottle?

There are [_________]{$partU} of pure alcohol in this bottle.

Use *g* for grams.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

This problem can be boiled down to this question: What is  [` [$per]% `] of [` [$whole] `]? We will show multiple methods to solve this problem.

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [` [$per]% `] of [` [$whole] `] is [`x`], so "[`[$per]`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`x`] out of [`[$whole]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$per]}{100} &= \frac{x}{[$whole]} \\
   100x &= [$per] \cdot [$whole] \\
   100x &= [$per*$whole] \\
   \frac{100x}{100} &= \frac{[$per*$whole]}{100} \\
   x &= [$part]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

There are [`[$partU]`] of pure alcohol in this bottle.

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem. This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \iff 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

The question is: What is [` [$per]% `] of [` [$whole] `]? Assume [`x`] is [` [$per]% `] of [` [$whole] `]. We have:

    [`` 
    \begin{aligned}
        x  & = [$dec] \cdot [$whole] \\
        & = [$part] 
        \end{aligned}
        ``]

There are [`[$partU]`] of pure alcohol in this bottle.

####Method 3

In the sentence "What is [` [$per]% `] of [` [$whole] `],"

* "what" is the *percentage*,
* [` [$per]% `] is the *rate*,
* [` [$whole] `] is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{percentage} = \text{rate} \cdot \text{base} `], we do a multiplication to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{percentage } = \text{rate} \cdot \text{base} = [$per]% \cdot [$whole] = [$per/100] \cdot [$whole] = [$part] ``]

There are [`[$partU]`] of pure alcohol in this bottle.
