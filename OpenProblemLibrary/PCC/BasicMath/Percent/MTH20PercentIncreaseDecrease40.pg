BEGIN_PGML

[$name] used to make [`[$originalC]`] dollars per hour. After [$pronoun] earned [$modify] Bachelor's degree, [$modify] pay rate increased to [`[$newC]`] dollars per hour. What is the percentage increase in [$name]'s salary?

The percentage increase is [________]{$ans}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To calculate the percentage increase/decrease, first we find the amount of increase/decrease by doing a simple subtraction calculation, 
and then we find the percentage increase/decrease.

In this problem, the amount of increase is [`[$newC]-[$originalC]=[$increaseC]`].

Since [$name]'s pay rate was initially [`[$originalC]`], we need to ask: [`[$increase]`] is what percent of [`[$original]`]?

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem.

Assume [`[$increase]`] is [`x%`] of [` [$original] `], so "[`x`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$increase]`] out of [`[$original]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{100} &= \frac{[$increase]}{[$original]} \\
   [$original]x &= [$increase] \cdot 100 \\
   [$original]x &= [$increase*100] \\
   \frac{[$original]x}{[$original]} &= \frac{[$increase*100]}{[$original]} \\
   x &= [$per]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The percentage increase in [$name]'s salary was [`[$per]%`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem.

This translation from English to may  should help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \Longleftrightarrow 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

Let the increase [`[$increase]`] be [`x`] (as a percent) of [`[$original]`]. That means:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$increase]   &= x \cdot [$original] \\
  \frac{[$increase]}{[$original]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$original]}{[$original]} \\
  [$per]       & =  x
\end{aligned}
`]

The percentage increase in [$name]'s salary was [`[$per]%`].

####Method 3  

We first divide the "new number" by the "original number":

    [`` \frac{[$new]}{[$original]} = [$s1] = [$s3]% ``]

So the new number is [`[$s3]%`] of the original number, implying the percentage increase is [` [$s3]% - 100% = [$per]% `].

The percentage increase in [$name]'s salary was [`[$per]%`].
