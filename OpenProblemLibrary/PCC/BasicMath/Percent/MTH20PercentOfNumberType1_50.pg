BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem. Assume [` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `] is [`x`], so "[`[$p1]`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`x`] out of [`[$num]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{[$p1]}{100} &= \frac{x}{[$num]} \\
   100x &= [$p1] \cdot [$num] \\
   100x &= [$p1*$num] \\
   \frac{100x}{100} &= \frac{[$p1*$num]}{100} \\
   x &= [$ans1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

[` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `] is [`[$ans1]`].

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem. This translation from English to math may help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \iff 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

The question is: What is [` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `]? Assume [`x`] is [` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `]. We have:

    [`` 
    \begin{aligned}
        x  & = [$d1] \cdot [$num] \\
        & = [$ans1] 
        \end{aligned}
        ``]

[` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `] is [`[$ans1]`].

####Method 3

In the sentence "[` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `] is what,"

* "what" is the *percentage*,
* [` [$p1]% `] is the *rate*,
* [` [$num] `] is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{percentage} = \text{rate} \cdot \text{base} `], we do a multiplication to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{percentage } = \text{rate} \cdot \text{base} = [$p1]% \cdot [$num] = [$d1] \cdot [$num] = [$ans1] ``]

[` [$p1]% `] of [` [$num] `] is [`[$ans1]`].
