BEGIN_PGML

A house was bought two years ago at the price of [`[$value0C]`]. Each year, the house's value increased by [`[$per]%`]. What's the house's value this year?

The house's value this year is [__________]{$value2C}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The house's value two years ago was [`[$value0C]`]. After one year, the house's value increased by [`[$per]%`].

The amount of increase was [`[$per]%`] of [`[$value0C]`]. There are two methods to find this amount.

We can use proportion. Let [`x`] dollars be the amount of increase, then we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{[$value0]} &= \frac{[$per]}{100} \\
   100x &= [$value0]\cdot[$per] \\
   100x &= [$value0*$per] \\
   \frac{100x}{100} &= \frac{[$value0*$per]}{100} \\
   x &= [$increase0]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Or we can use the percentage formula to find the amount of increase:

    [`` [$dec] \cdot [$value0] = [$increase0] ``]

After one year, the house's value became [`[$value0C]+[$increase0C]=[$value1C]`].

After another year, the house's value increased by another [`[$per]%`].

The amount of increase was [`[$per]%`] of [`[$value1C]`]. There are two methods to find this amount.

We can use proportion. Let [`x`] dollars be the amount of increase, then we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{[$value1]} &= \frac{[$per]}{100} \\
   100x &= [$value1]\cdot[$per] \\
   100x &= [$value1*$per] \\
   \frac{100x}{100} &= \frac{[$value1*$per]}{100} \\
   x &= [$increase1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Or we can use the percentage formula to find the amount of increase:

    [`` [$dec] \cdot [$value1] = [$increase1] ``]

After two years, the house's value became [`[$value1C]+[$increase1C]=[$value2C]`].

The house's value this year is [`[$value2C]`].
