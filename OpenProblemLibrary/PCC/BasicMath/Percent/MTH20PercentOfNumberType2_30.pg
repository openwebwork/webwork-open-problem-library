BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

We will use proportion to solve this problem.

Assume [`[$a1]`] is [`x%`] of [` [$b] `], so "[`x`] out of [`100`]" corresponds to "[`[$a1]`] out of [`[$b]`]".

We will write and solve the proportion:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   \frac{x}{100} &= \frac{[$a1]}{[$b]} \\
   [$b]x &= [$a1] \cdot 100 \\
   [$b]x &= [$a1*100] \\
   \frac{[$b]x}{[$b]} &= \frac{[$a1*100]}{[$b]} \\
   x &= [$ans1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

[`[$a1]`] is [`[$ans1][@$PERCENT@]`] of [` [$b] `].  

####Method 2  

We will use the percentage formula to solve this problem.

This translation from English to may  should help you remember the percentage formula.

    [` 2 \text{ is } 50% \text{ of } 4 \Longleftrightarrow 2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 `]

Assume [`[$a1]`] is [`x`] (as a percent) of [` [$b] `]. We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$a1] &= x \cdot [$b] \\
  \frac{[$a1]}{[$b]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$b]}{[$b]} \\  
  [$ans1/100] &= x\\
  x &= [$ans1]%
\end{aligned}
    ``]

[`[$a1]`] is [`[$ans1][@$PERCENT@]`] of [` [$b] `].  

####Method 3  

In the sentence "[`[$a1]`] is what percent of [` [$b] `],"

* [`[$a1]`] is the *percentage*,
* "what percent" is the *rate*,
* [` [$b] `] is the *base* (following the word "of").

By the formula [` \text{rate} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{base}} `], we do a division to solve the problem:

    [`` \text{rate} = \frac{\text{percentage}}{\text{base}} = \frac{[$a1]}{[$b]} = [$ans1/100] = [$ans1]% ``]

[`[$a1]`] is [`[$ans1][@$PERCENT@]`] of [` [$b] `].
