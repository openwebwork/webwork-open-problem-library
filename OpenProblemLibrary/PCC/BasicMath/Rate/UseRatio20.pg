BEGIN_PGML

According to a school's budget, the money spent on buying new equipment and money spent on maintenance of old equipment should be in the ratio of [`[$newR]:[$oldR]`]. In one year, if the money spent on buying new equipment is [`[$newC]`], how much money was spent on maintenance of old equipment?

In one year, if the money spent on buying new equipment was [`[$newC]`], [_________]{$oldC} was spent on maintenance of old equipment.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The ratio of new equipment buying to old equipment maintenance is given as [`[$newR]:[$oldR]`]. This can be written as either [`\frac{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}`] or [`\frac{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}`].

It's given the school spent [`[$newC]`] dollars on new equipment, so we will use the ratio [`\frac{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}`], so the unit "dollars spent on new equipment" will cancel:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$new] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment} \cdot \frac{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}} \\
   &= \frac{[$new] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{1} \cdot \frac{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}} \\
   &= \frac{[$new]}{1} \cdot \frac{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{[$newR]} \\
   &= \frac{[$new]\cdot[$oldR]}{1 \cdot [$newR]} \text{ dollars spent on maintenance} \\
   &= \frac{[$new*$oldR]}{[$newR]} \text{ dollars spent on maintenance} \\
   &= [$old] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In one year, if the money spent on buying new equipment was $[`[$new]`], [`[$oldC]`] was spent on maintenance of old equipment.
