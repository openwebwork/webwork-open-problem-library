BEGIN_PGML

In a mutual fund, each dollar of bond is matched by [`[$rateBSU]`] of stock.

Fill in the blanks.

*Question 1:* If a mutual fund has [`[$stock1U]`] in stock, it has [___________]{$bond1U} in bond.

----

*Question 2:* If a mutual fund has [`[$bond2U]`] in bond, it has [___________]{$stock2U} in stock.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

There is more than one way to solve this problem. I will use the "cancel unit" method.

It's given that for each dollar of bond, there are [`[$rateBSU]`] of stock. The rate can be written in two ways: [`\frac{$1 \text{ in bond}}{[$rateBSU] \text{ in stock}}`] and [`\frac{[$rateBSU] \text{ in stock}}{$1 \text{ in bond}}`]. We will choose one of these two rates based on what's given.

*Question 1:* It's given that there are [`[$stock1U]`] in stock, so we should choose the rate [`\frac{$1 \text{ in bond}}{[$rateBSU] \text{ in stock}}`], so the unit "dollars in stock" can cancel:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$stock1U] \text{ in stock} \cdot \frac{$1 \text{ in bond}}{[$rateBSU] \text{ in stock}} \\
   &= [$stock1] \cdot \frac{$1 \text{ in bond}}{[$rateBS]} \\
   &= \frac{[$stock1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rateBS]} \text{dollars in bond} \\
   &= \frac{[$stock1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rateBS]} \text{dollars in bond} \\
   &= \frac{[$stock1]}{[$rateBS]} \text{dollars in bond} \\
   &= [$bond1U] \text{ in stock}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If a mutual fund has [`[$stock1U]`] in stock, it has [`[$bond1U]`] in bond.

*Question 2:* It's given that there are [`[$bond2U]`] in bond, so we should choose the rate [`\frac{[$rateBSU] \text{ in stock}}{$1 \text{ in bond}}`], so the unit "dollars in bond" can cancel:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$bond2U] \text{ in bond} \cdot \frac{[$rateBSU] \text{ in stock}}{$1 \text{ in bond}} \\
   &= [$bond2] \cdot \frac{[$rateBSU] \text{ in bond}}{1} \\
   &= [$bond2] \cdot [$rateBSU] \text{ in bond} \\
   &= [$stock2U] \text{ in bond}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If a mutual fund has [`[$bond2U]`] in bond, it has [`[$stock2U]`] in stock.
