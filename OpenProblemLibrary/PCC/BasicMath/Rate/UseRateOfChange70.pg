BEGIN_PGML

On average, a restaurant uses [`[$rateU]`] of vegetable oil per day.

Fill in blanks.

a. The restaurant will use [_________]{$totalU} of vegetable oil in [`[$days]`] days.

b. The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [__________]{$days1} days.

Use *lb* for pounds.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

*Part a:* It's given that [`[$rateU]`] of vegetable oil is used every day, or [`\frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} `].

To find the amount of oil used in [`[$days]`] days, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$days] \text{ days} \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} \\
   &= [$days] \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1} \\
   &= [$days] \cdot [$rateU] \\
   &= [$totalU]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Notice that the unit *days* cancelled.

In [`[$days]`] days, the restaurant will use [` [$total] `] lb of vegetable oil.

*Part a:* It's given there are [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil to use. We cannot still do [`[$total1U] \cdot \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} `], because the unit "lb" will not cancel. We need to "flip" the rate from [` \frac{[$rateU]}{1 \text{ day}} `] to [` \frac{1 \text{ day}}{[$rateU]} `] first, and then do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$total1U] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ day}}{[$rateU]} \\
   &= [$total1] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ day}}{[$rate]}  \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ days} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rate]} \text{ days} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{[$rate]} \text{ days}  \\
   &= [$days1] \text{ days}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The restaurant will use [`[$total1U]`] of vegetable oil in [`[$days1]`] days.
