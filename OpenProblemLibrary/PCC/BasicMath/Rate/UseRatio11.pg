BEGIN_PGML

The ratio of a school's male students to female students is [`[$maleR]:[$femaleR]`]. If the school has [`[$female]`] female students, how many male students are there?

*Solution:* If the school has [`[$female]`] female students, the school has [_________]{$male} male students.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The ratio of male to female students is given as [`[$maleR]:[$femaleR]`]. This can be written as either [`\frac{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}`] or [`\frac{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}`].

It's given the school has [`[$female]`] female students, so we will use the ratio [`\frac{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}`], so the unit "female students" will cancel:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$female] \text{ female students} \cdot \frac{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}} \\
   &= \frac{[$female] \text{ female students}}{1} \cdot \frac{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}} \\
   &= \frac{[$female]}{1} \cdot \frac{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}{[$femaleR]} \\
   &= \frac{[$female]\cdot[$maleR]}{1 \cdot [$femaleR]} \text{ male students} \\
   &= \frac{[$female*$maleR]}{[$femaleR]} \text{ male students} \\
   &= [$male] \text{ male students} 
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution:* If the school has [`[$female]`] female students, the school has [`[$male]`] male students.
