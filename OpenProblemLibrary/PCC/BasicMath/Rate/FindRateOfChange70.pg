BEGIN_PGML

A restaurant used [`[$total]`] lb of vegetable oil in [`[$days]`] days. On average, how many lb of vegetable oil does the restaurant use every day?

On average, the restaurant uses [__________]{$rate} lb of vegetable oil every day.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It's given that [`[$total]`] lb of vegetable oil were used in [`[$days]`] days. The rate's unit is "lb per day," so we divide the number of lb by the number of days:

    [`` \frac{[$total]\text{ lb}}{[$days]\text{ days}} = [$rate]\text{ lb per day} ``]

On average, the restaurant uses [`[$rate]`] lb of vegetable oil every day.
