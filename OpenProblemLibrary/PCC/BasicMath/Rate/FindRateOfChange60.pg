BEGIN_PGML

In a city, the owner of a house valued at [`[$value]`] thousand dollars needs to pay [`[$taxU]`] in property tax. Find the property tax rate at this city. In other words, how much property tax does the owner need to pay for each thousand dollars of property value?

For each thousand dollars of property value, the owner needs to pay [________]{$rateU}.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It's given that [`[$taxU]`] needs to be paid for [`[$value]`] thousand dollars of property. To find how much tax needs to be paid for each thousand dollars of property, we use division:

    [`` \frac{[$tax]\text{ dollars in tax}}{[$value] \text{ thousand dollars in property value}} = [$rate] \text{ dollars in tax per thousand dollars in property value}``]

For each thousand dollars of property value, the owner needs to pay [`[$rateU]`].
