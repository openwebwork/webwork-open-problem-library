BEGIN_PGML

The ratio of a school's male students to female students is [`[$maleR]:[$femaleR]`]. If the school has [`[$male]`] male students, how many female students are there?

If the school has [`[$male]`] male students, the school has [_________]{$female} female students.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The ratio of male to female students is given as [`[$maleR]:[$femaleR]`]. This can be written as either [`\frac{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}`] or [`\frac{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}`].

It's given the school has [`[$male]`] male students, so we will use the ratio [`\frac{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}{[$maleR] \text{ male students}}`], so the unit "male students" will cancel:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$male] \text{ male students} \cdot \frac{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}{[$maleR] \text{ male students}} \\
   &= \frac{[$male] \text{ male students}}{1} \cdot \frac{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}{[$maleR] \text{ male students}} \\
   &= \frac{[$male]}{1} \cdot \frac{[$femaleR] \text{ female students}}{[$maleR]} \\
   &= \frac{[$male]\cdot[$femaleR]}{1 \cdot [$maleR]} \text{ female students} \\
   &= \frac{[$male*$femaleR]}{[$maleR]} \text{ female students} \\
   &= [$female] \text{ female students}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

If the school has [`[$male]`] male students, the school has [`[$female]`] female students.
