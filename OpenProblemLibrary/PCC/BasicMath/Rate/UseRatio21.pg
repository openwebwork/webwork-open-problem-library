BEGIN_PGML

According to a school's budget, the money spent on buying new equipment and money spent on maintenance of old equipment should be in the ratio of [`[$newR]:[$oldR]`]. In one year, if the money spent on maintenance of old equipment was [`[$oldC]`], how much money was spent on buying new equipment?

In one year, if the money spent on  maintenance of old equipment was [`[$oldC]`], then [_________]{$newC} was spent on buying new equipment.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The ratio of new equipment buying to old equipment maintenance is given as [`[$newR]:[$oldR]`]. This can be written as either [`\frac{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}`] or [`\frac{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}`].

It's given the school spent [`[$oldC]`] dollars on maintenance of old equipment, so we will use the ratio [`\frac{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}`], so the unit "dollars spent on maintenance" will cancel:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=}[$old] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance} \cdot \frac{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}} \\
   &= \frac{[$old] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}}{1} \cdot \frac{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{[$oldR] \text{ dollars spent on maintenance}} \\
   &= \frac{[$old]}{1} \cdot \frac{[$newR] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}}{[$oldR]} \\
   &= \frac{[$old]\cdot[$newR]}{1 \cdot [$oldR]} \text{ dollars spent on new equipment} \\
   &= \frac{[$old*$newR]}{[$oldR]} \text{ dollars spent on new equipment} \\
   &= [$new] \text{ dollars spent on new equipment}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

In one year, if the money spent on  maintenance of old equipment was [`[$oldC]`], then [`[$newC]`] was spent on buying new equipment.
