BEGIN_PGML

[$name] jogs every day. Last month, [$pronoun] jogged [`[$hours]`] hours for a total of [`[$distance]`] miles. 

Answer the following questions with decimals. Round your answers to the hundredth place when needed.

a. [$name]'s average speed was [__________]{$rateU}.

b. On average, it takes [$name] [__________]{$hourPerMileRoundedU} to run each mile.

Use *mi* for miles and *hr* for hours.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

*Part a:* [$name] jogged [`[$distanceU]`] in [`[$hoursU]`]. The unit of speed is "miles per hour," so we should divide "miles" by "hours":

    [`` \frac{[$distanceU]}{[$hoursU]} = [$rateU] ``]

[$name]'s average speed was [`[$rate]`] miles per hour.

*Part b:* In Question 2, the key word is "each mile". This implies the unit of the rate is "hours per mile," so we divide "hours" by "miles":

    [`` \frac{[$hoursU]}{[$distanceU]} \approx [$hourPerMileRoundedU]\text{ per mi} ``]

On average, it takes [$name] approximately [`[$hourPerMileRoundedU]`] to run each mile.
