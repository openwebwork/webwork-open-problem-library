BEGIN_PGML

A mutual fund consists of [`[$stock]`][@$PERCENT@] stock and [`[$bond]`][@$PERCENT@] bond. In other words, for each [`[$stock]`] dollars of stock, there are [`[$bond]`] dollars of bond.

Fill in the blanks with decimal rounded to the hundredth place.

a. For each dollar of stock, there are approximately [___________]{$ansBS} dollars of bond.

a. For each dollar of bond, there are approximately [___________]{$ansSB} dollars of stock.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It's given that for each [`[$stock]`] dollars of stock, there are [`[$bond]`] dollars of bond.

*Part a:* The key part is "for each dollar of stock". This implies the rate's unit should be "dollars in bond per dollar in stock." We do:

    [`` \frac{\text{value of bond}}{\text{value of stock}} = \frac{[$bond]\text{ dollars in bond}}{[$stock]\text{ dollars in stock}} \approx [$ansBS] \text{ dollars in bond per dollar in stock}``]

For each dollar of stock, there are approximately [`[$ansBS]`] dollars of bond.

*Part b:* The key part is "for each dollar of bond". This implies the rate's unit should be "dollars in stock per dollar in bond." We do:

    [`` \frac{\text{value of stock}}{\text{value of bond}} = \frac{[$stock]\text{ dollars in stock}}{[$bond]\text{ dollars in bond}} \approx [$ansSB] \text{ dollars in stock per dollar in bond}``]

For each dollar of bond, there are approximately [`[$ansSB]`] dollars of stock.
