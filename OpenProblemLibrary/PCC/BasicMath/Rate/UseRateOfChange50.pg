BEGIN_PGML

On average, [$name] collects [`[$rate]`] stamps every year.

Fill in blanks:

a. At this rate, [$name] would collect [_________]{$total} stamps in [`[$years]`] years.

b. At this rate, [$name] would collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [___________]{$years1} years.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

*Part a:* It's given that [$name] collects [`[$rate]`] stamps every year, or [`\frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}} `].

To find the number of stamps [$name] can collect in [`[$years]`] years, we do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$years] \text{ years} \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}} \\
   &= [$years] \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1} \\
   &= [$years] \cdot [$rate] \text{ stamps} \\
   &= [$total] \text{ stamps}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Notice that the unit *year* cancelled.

At this rate, [$name] would collect [`[$total]`] stamps in [`[$years]`] years.

*Part b:* To find how long it would take to collect [`[$total1]`] stamps, we cannot still do [`[$total1] \text{ stamps} \cdot \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}} `], because the unit "stamps" will not cancel. We need to "flip" the rate from [` \frac{[$rate] \text{ stamps}}{1 \text{ year}} `] to [` \frac{1 \text{ year}}{[$rate] \text{ stamps}} `] first, and then do:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   &\phantom{{}=} [$total1] \text{ stamps} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ year}}{[$rate] \text{ stamps}} \\
   &\phantom{{}=} [$total1] \cdot \frac{1 \text{ year}}{[$rate]} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{[$rate]} \text{ years} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1] \cdot 1}{1 \cdot [$rate]} \text{ years} \\
   &= \frac{[$total1]}{[$rate]} \text{ years}  \\
   &= [$years1] \text{ years}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

At this rate, [$name] would collect [`[$total1]`] stamps in [`[$years1]`] years.
