TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

An artist sells his paintings at [`[$aC]`] per piece. Currently, he can sell [`[$b]`] paintings per year. Thus, his annual income from paintings is [`[$a]\cdot[$b]=[$a*$b]`] dollars. He plans to raise the price. However, for each [`[$cC]`] of price increase per painting, his customers would buy [`[$d]`] fewer paintings annually.

Assume the artist would raise the price of his painting [`x`] times, each time by [`[$cC]`]. Use an expanded polynomial to represent his new income per year.

    [`` \text{new annual income}=``][_________________]{$ans} dollars

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Currently, each painting costs [`[$aC]`]. After raising the price [`x`] times, each time by [`[$cC]`], each painting's new price would be [`[$poly1]`] dollars.

Currently, the artist sells [`[$b]`] paintings per year. After raising the price [`x`] times, each time selling [`[$d]`] fewer paintings, he would sell [`[$poly2]`] paintings per year.

His annual income can be calculated by multiplying each painting's price with the number of paintings he would sell:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   \text{annual income} &=  ([$poly1])([$poly2]) \\
                     &= [$step1] \\
                     &= [$step2] \\
                     &= [$step3] \\
                     &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

After raising the price [`x`] times, each time by [`[$cC]`], the artist's annual income from paintings would be [`[$ans]`] dollars.
