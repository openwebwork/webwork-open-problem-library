BEGIN_PGML

One car started at Town A, and traveled due north at [`[$car1Speed]`] miles per hour. [`[$headStart]`] hours later, another car started at the same spot and traveled due east at [`[$car2Speed]`] miles per hour. Assume both cars don't stop, after how many hours since the second car starts would the distance between them be [`[$distance]`] miles? Round your answer to two decimal places if needed.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [`t`] hours since the second car started, those two cars' distance would be [`[$distance]`] miles. During this time, the second car traveled [`[$car2Speed]t`] miles. Since the first car traveled [`[$headStart]`] more hours, the first car traveled [`[$car1Speed](t+[$headStart])`] miles.

By the graph, we can use Pythagorean Theorem to set up the equation:

    [`` [[$car1Speed](t+[$headStart])]^2+([$car2Speed]t)^2=[$distance]^2 ``]

This is a quadratic equation. We will change it to the standard form:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [[$car1Speed](t+[$headStart])]^2+([$car2Speed]t)^2 &= [$distance]^2 \\
   [$car1Speed]^2(t+[$headStart])^2+[$car2Speed]^2t^2 &= [$distance]^2 \\
   [$car1Speed**2](t^2+[$headStart*2]t+[$headStart**2])+[$car2Speed**2]t^2 &= [$distance**2] \\
   [$car1Speed**2]t^2+[$headStart*2*$car1Speed**2]t+[$headStart**2*$car1Speed**2]+[$car2Speed**2]t^2 &= [$distance**2] \\
   [$car1Speed**2+$car2Speed**2]t^2+[$headStart*2*$car1Speed**2]t+[$headStart**2*$car1Speed**2] &= [$distance**2] \\
   [$car1Speed**2+$car2Speed**2]t^2+[$headStart*2*$car1Speed**2]t+[$headStart**2*$car1Speed**2] \mathbf{{}-[$distance**2]} &= [$distance**2] \mathbf{{}-[$distance**2]} \\
   [$car1Speed**2+$car2Speed**2]t^2+[$headStart*2*$car1Speed**2]t+[$headStart**2*$car1Speed**2-$distance**2] &= 0
\end{aligned}
    ``]

We will solve the equation by the Quadratic Formula. Identify that [`a=[$a],b=[$b],c=[$c]`].

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\
   x &= \frac{-([$b]) \pm \sqrt{([$b])^{2}-4([$a])([$c])}}{2([$a])} \\
   x &= \frac{[$b*-1] \pm \sqrt{[$discriminant]}}{[$a*2]} \\
   x &\approx \frac{[$b*-1] \pm [$s1]}{[$a*2]} \\
   x&\approx\frac{[$b*-1] + [$s1]}{[$a*2]} \text{  or  } x\approx \frac{[$b*-1] - [$s1]}{[$a*2]} \\
   x&\approx[$ans] \text{  or  } x= \text{a negative number}
\end{aligned}

Approximately [`[$ansShow]`] hours since the second car starts, the distance between those two cars would be [`[$distance]`] miles.
