BEGIN_PGML

A rectangle's base is [`[$moreU]`] shorter than [$multiple] its height. The rectangle's area is [`[$areaU]`]. Find this rectangle's dimensions.

    The rectangle's height is [___________]{$heightU}.

    The rectangle's base is [___________]{$baseU}.

$a = $times;
$b = -$more;
$c = -$area;

$s1 = -$b;
$s2 = $b**2-4*$a*$c;
$s3 = 2*$a;
$s4 = sqrt($s2);
$s5 = ($s1-$s4)/$s3;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let the rectangle's height be [`x`] inches.  Then its base is [`[$times]x-[$more]`] inches.

It's given that the rectangle's area is [`[$areaU]`], so we can write and solve the equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   x([$times]x-[$more]) &= [$area] \\
   [$times]x^{2}-[$more]x &= [$area] \\
   [$times]x^{2}-[$more]x - [$area] &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The polynomial can be factored, so we will first solve this equation by factoring:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   ([$times]x+[$base])(x-[$height]) &=0 \\
   [$times]x+[$base]=0 &\text{  or  } x-[$height]=0  \\
   [$times]x=-[$base] &\text{  or  } x=[$height] \\
   x=\text{a negative number} &\text{  or  } x=[$height]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

We could also solve the equation by the Quadratic Formula.

Identify that [`a=[$a],b=[$b],c=[$c]`].

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\
   x &= \frac{-([$b]) \pm \sqrt{([$b])^{2}-4([$a])([$c])}}{2([$a])} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] \pm \sqrt{[$s2]}}{[$s3]} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] \pm [$s4]}{[$s3]} \\
   x &= \frac{[$s1] + [$s4]}{[$s3]}  \text{  or  } x= \frac{[$s1] - [$s4]}{[$s3]} \\
   x&=[$height] \text{  or  } x= \text{a negative number}
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Notice that there is no need to calculate the negative result, as a rectangle's height cannot be negative. The height is [`[$heightU]`].

Recall that the rectangle's base is [`[$times]x-[$more]`] inches, where [`x`] is the height. Thus the base is [`[$times] \cdot [$heightU] - [$moreU]`], which is [`[$baseU]`].

So the rectangle's height is [`[$heightU]`], and its base is [`[$baseU]`].
