# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for

# source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Expand and simplify the expression. [@KeyboardInstructions("Use [|sqrt()|]* for the square root symbol. For example: [`\\sqrt{2}=`][|sqrt(2)|]*.")@]**

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this
#feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and
#may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a
#walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Using the FOIL method to multiply these binomial expressions together,
we will have four terms:

 [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   ([$num1] + [$sqrt])([$num2] + [$sqrt])
   &= [$num1] \cdot [$num2] + [$num1][$sqrt] +[$num2][$sqrt]+[$sqrt]\cdot [$sqrt] \\
 &=[$temp] + [$num1] [$sqrt] + [$num2] [$sqrt] + [$radicand]\\
   &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
