########Begin Load Macro Files############
#This section loads any and all .pl files that contain useful subroutines
# for the problem.

loadMacros(
  "PGstandard.pl",       #Always needed
  "MathObjects.pl",      #Almost always needed
  "PGML.pl",             #Almost always needed
  "contextLimitedRadical.pl",
  "PCCmacros.pl",
  "PGcourse.pl",

########Begin Problem Setup############
#This is where you initialize variables and run computations

Context("Numeric");

########Begin What the Student Sees############

TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for
# the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the
# source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Expand and simplify the expression. [@KeyboardInstructions("Use [|sqrt()|]* for the square root symbol. For example: [`\\sqrt{2}=`][|sqrt(2)|]*.")@]**

    [``[$sqrt1] \left([$sqrt2] + [$sqrt3]\right) =``] [__________]{$answer}

END_PGML

########Begin more complicated answer processing (if needed)############

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this
#feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and
#may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a
#walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Use the distributive property and simplify.

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   [$sqrt1] \left([$sqrt2] + [$sqrt3]\right) 
   &= [$sqrt1] \cdot [$sqrt2] + [$sqrt1] \cdot [$sqrt3] \\
   &= [$answer]
