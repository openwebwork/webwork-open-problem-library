########Begin Load Macro Files############
#This section loads any and all .pl files that contain useful subroutines
# for the problem.

loadMacros(
  "PGstandard.pl",       #Always needed
  "MathObjects.pl",      #Almost always needed
  "PGML.pl",             #Almost always needed
  "contextLimitedRadical.pl",
  "PCCmacros.pl",

########Begin Problem Setup############
#This is where you initialize variables and run computations


$radicand = list_random(5,6,7,11,13);
$num = random(3,10,1);

Context("LimitedRadical");
$sqrt = Formula("sqrt([$radicand])");

Context("LimitedNumeric");
$answer = Real($num**2 - $radicand);

########Begin What the Student Sees############

TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for
# the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the
# source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Expand and simplify the expression.

[``\left([$num] - [$sqrt]\right)\left([$num] + [$sqrt]\right) =``] [______________________]{$answer}

END_PGML

########Begin more complicated answer processing (if needed)############

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this
#feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and
#may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a
#walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Use the FOIL method to multiply these binomial expressions together, or notice
that we have the difference of squares formula:

    [`` (A+B)(A-B)=A^{2}-B^{2} ``]

We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
    ([$num] - [$sqrt])([$num] + [$sqrt]) 
               &= [$num]^2 - \left([$sqrt]\right)^2 \\
               &= [$num**2] - [$radicand] \\
               &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
