########Begin Load Macro Files############
#This section loads any and all .pl files that contain useful subroutines for the problem.

loadMacros(
  "PGstandard.pl",       #Always needed
  "MathObjects.pl",      #Almost always needed
  "PGML.pl",             #Almost always needed
  "contextLimitedRadical.pl",
  "PCCmacros.pl",
  "PGcourse.pl",
);



########Begin Problem Setup############
#This is where you initialize variables and run computations

Context("LimitedRadical");
$var1 = RandomVariableName(type=>'variable');
Context()->variables->are($var1=>'Real');

#Create some random integers.
$a = random(2,9,1);
do {$b = random(2,10,1);} until (gcd($a,$b)==1);
$c = Real($b*$b);


$answer = Formula("$a*$var1/$b");
#Create a Math Object Real that will be the problem's answer. This is much more intricate than a simple Perl scalar that would result from .


TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML


Rationalize the denominator and simplify the expression.
 
      [``\frac{[$a] [$var1]}{\sqrt{[$c]}}``]  =   [_________]{$answer} .

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Because the denominator in this problem is a perfect square, we can easily evaluate the square root:

    [`` \frac{[$a][$var1]}{\sqrt{[$c]}} = \frac{[$a][$var1]}{[$b]} ``]
