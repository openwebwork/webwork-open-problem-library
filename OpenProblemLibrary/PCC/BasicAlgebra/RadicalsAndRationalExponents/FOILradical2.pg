########Begin What the Student Sees############

TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for
# the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the
# source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Expand and simplify the expression.

[``\left([$sqrt1] + [$sqrt2]\right)\left([$sqrt1] - [$sqrt2]\right) =``] [__________________]{$answer}

########Begin more complicated answer processing (if needed)############

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this
#feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and
#may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a
#walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Use the FOIL method to multiply these binomial expressions together, or notice
that we have the difference of squares formula:

    [`` (A+B)(A-B)=A^{2}-B^{2} ``]

We have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
    ([$sqrt1] + [$sqrt2])([$sqrt1] - [$sqrt2]) 
               &= \left([$sqrt1]\right)^2 - \left([$sqrt2]\right)^2 \\
               &= [$radicand1] - [$radicand2] \\
               &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
    ``]
