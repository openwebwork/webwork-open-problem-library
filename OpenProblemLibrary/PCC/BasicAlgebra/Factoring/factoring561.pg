# WeBWorK problem written by Chris Hughes, 2013
# Portland Community College
#
# Template:
# Factor the given polynomial. 
#
#     e (ac x^2y^2 + (bc+ad) xy + bd)
#
# The answer is
#
#     e(a xy + b)( c xy + d)
# 
# a = c 
# b = d = 1
#
# So this problem becomes 
#
#      e (a^2 x^2y^2 + 2 a xy + 1) = e(axy +1)^2
#
# e is integer on [2,10] and we check that e*a^2, 2*a*e aren't too big

BEGIN_PGML
Factor the given polynomial. 

    [`[$question]=`] [___________________]{$ans}

[@KeyboardInstructions("If the expression cannot be factored then answer with [|prime|]*.")@]**

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Firstly, let's note that [`[$e]`] is common to each term.

    [`
        [$question] = [$step0]
    `]

We need to find factors of [`[$end]`] that when combined with the 
factors of [`[$leading]`] give [`[$middle]`];
this problem is an example of _the square of the sum of two terms_

     [`
                [$question]  = [$ans]
     `]

You might have written

     [`
                [$question]  = [$step]
     `]

which is also correct.

Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL (*F*irst *O*utside *I*nside *L*ast) technique (exercise).

####Alternative Approach

When factoring, we should always first look for any greatest common factors of the terms. Here we find that [`[$e]`] is such a factor, and we have

    [`
        [$question] = [$step0]
    `]

To factor the remaining trinomial further, note that its leading term and its final term are perfect squares. Their square roots are [`[$a][$var1][$var2]`] and [`[@abs([$b])@]`]. After multiplying their square roots, we have [`[@$a*abs([$b])@][$var1][$var2]`], which is [%(negative)%] half of the middle term. When all this happens, we have a perfect square trinomial, and the two square roots we found make the binomial that should be squared. [%Since the middle coefficient was negative, the binomial should be a difference, not a sum.%] That is,

     [`
                [$question] = [$step]
     `]
