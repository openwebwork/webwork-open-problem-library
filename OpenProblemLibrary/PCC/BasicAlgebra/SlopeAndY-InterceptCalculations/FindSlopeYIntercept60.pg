BEGIN_PGML

Find the line's slope and [`y`]-intercept. [@KeyboardInstructions("If either of these do not exist, you may enter [|DNE|]* or [|NONE|]*.")@]**

A line has equation [`` y= \frac{x}{[$den]} +[$b] ``].

    This line's slope is [_______]{$m}.

    This line's [`y`]-intercept is [_______].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When an equation of a line is written in the form [` y=mx+b `], it is said to be in *slope-intercept form*. In this form, [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the coordinate on the [`y`]-axis where the line intercepts the [`y`]-axis.

In this problem, the line's equation is given as [`` y= \frac{x}{[$den]} +[$b] ``]. We can think of the first term as [``\frac{1}{[$den]}x ``]. This is because:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\frac{x}{[$den]} &= \frac{1}{[$den]} \cdot \frac{x}{1}\\ &= \frac{1}{[$den]}x\end{aligned} ``]

Thus the line's slope is [``\frac{1}{[$den]}``], and its [`y`]-intercept has coordinates [` (0,[$b]) `].
