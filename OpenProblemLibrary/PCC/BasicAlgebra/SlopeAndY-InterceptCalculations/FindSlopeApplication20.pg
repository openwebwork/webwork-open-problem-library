BEGIN_PGML

A company set aside a certain amount of money in the year 2000. The company spent exactly the same amount from that fund each year on perks for its employees. In [` [$yx1]`], there was still [`[$cy1]`] left in the fund. In [`[$yx2]`], there was [`[$cy2]`] left. What is the rate (in dollars per year) at which this company is spending from this fund? 

The company is spending [__]{$cm}{width=>15} per year on perks for its employees.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To find the slope, we need two points on the line. We have been given that [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`] are points on the linear model, so we can use the slope formula:

    [`` \text{slope}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} ``]

    First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:

    [`` ([$x1],[$y1]) \longrightarrow (x_{1},y_{1}) ``]

    [`` ([$x2],[$y2]) \longrightarrow (x_{2},y_{2}) ``]

    Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$outputy1]}{[$x2]-[$outputx1]}\\&=\frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]}\\&=[$m] \end{aligned}``]

    This line's slope is [`[$m]`]. This implies that the company is spending [`[$cm]`] per year on perks for its employees.
