BEGIN_PGML

Find the line's slope and [`y`]-intercept. [@KeyboardInstructions("If either of these do not exist, you may enter [|DNE|]* or [|NONE|]*.")@]**

A line has equation [`` x= [$a] ``].

    This line's slope is [_______]{$m}.

    This line's [`y`]-intercept is [_______].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

When an equation of a line is written in the form [` y=mx+b `], it is said to be in *slope-intercept form*. In this form, [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the coordinate on the [`y`]-axis where the line intercepts the [`y`]-axis.

In this problem, the line's equation is given as [`` x= [$a] ``]. This is a special line which is parallel to the [`y`]-axis; it is a vertical line. Note that we cannot rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form because there is no [`y`] present to solve for and isolate on the left side.

The line's slope is undefined, so we can say that it *D*oes *N*ot *E*xist. Its [`y`]-intercept *D*oes *N*ot *E*xist either; it is a vertical line parallel to the [`y`]-axis, so there is not point where it would cross the [`y`]-axis.
