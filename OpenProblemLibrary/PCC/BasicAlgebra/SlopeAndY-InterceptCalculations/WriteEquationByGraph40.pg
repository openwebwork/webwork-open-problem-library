BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

A line's slope-intercept equation has the form [` y=mx+b`], where [`m`] is the slope and [`b`] is the [`y`]-intercept. We first find the slope.

>>[@ image($solution_graph, width => 500, tex_size => 1000, extra_html_tags=>"$sol_graph_alt_text") @]*<<

To find the slope of a line from its graph, we identify two points, and then draw a slope triangle. It's wise to choose points with integer coordinates. For this problem, we choose [` (0,[$b])`] and [`([$XX],[$YY])`].

Next, we draw a slope triangle and find the "rise" and "run". In this problem, the rise is [` [$rise]`] and the run is [`[$run]`].

[``\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{[$rise]}{[$run]}=[$mfrac]``]

This line's slope is [`[$mfrac]`].

It's clear in the graph that this line's [`y`]-intercept is [`(0,[$b])`].


So this line's slope-intercept equation is [`y= [$mfrac] x+ [$b]`].
