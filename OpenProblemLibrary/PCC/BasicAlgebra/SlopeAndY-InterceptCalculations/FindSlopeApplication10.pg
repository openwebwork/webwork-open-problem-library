BEGIN_PGML

By your cell phone contract, you pay a monthly fee plus some money for each minute you use the phone during the month. In one month, you spent [`[$x1]`] minutes on the phone, and paid [`[$cy1]`]. In another month, you spent [`[$x2]`] minutes on the phone, and paid [`[$cy2]`]. What is the rate (in dollars per minute) that the phone company is charging you? That is, what is the slope of the line if you plotted the bill versus the number of minutes spent on the phone?

The rate is [__]{$cm}{width=>5} per minute.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To find the slope, we need two points on the line. We have been given that [`([$x1],[$y1])`] and [`([$x2],[$y2])`] are points on the linear model, so we can use the slope formula:

    [`` \text{slope}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} ``]

    First, we mark which number corresponds to which variable in the formula:

    [`` ([$x1],[$y1]) \longrightarrow (x_{1},y_{1}) ``]

    [`` ([$x2],[$y2]) \longrightarrow (x_{2},y_{2}) ``]

    Now we substitute these numbers into the corresponding variables in the slope formula:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$outputy1]}{[$x2]-[$outputx1]}\\&=\frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]}\\&=[$m] \end{aligned}``]

    This line's slope is [`[$m]`]. This implies you have to pay [`[$cm]`] per minute that you use the phone.
