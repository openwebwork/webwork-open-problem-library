BEGIN_PGML

In a certain store, cashiers can serve [`[$a]`] customers per hour on average. If [`x`] customers arrive at the store in a given hour, then the average number of customers [`C`] waiting in line can be modeled by the function

    [``` C(x) = [$func] ```]

where [`x<[$a]`].

Answer the following questions with a graphing calculator. Round your answers to integers.

a. If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [__________]{$y1r} customers waiting in line.

a. If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [__________]{$ans2} customers arrived in the past hour.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, approximately how many customers are waiting in line. To answer this question, we substitute [`x`] with [`[$x1]`], and we have:

    [`` C([$x1]) = \frac{[$x1]^{2}}{[$a2]-[$a]([$x1])} \approx [$y1] \approx [$y1r] ``]

    If [`[$x1]`] customers arrived in the store in the past hour, there are approximately [`[$y1r]`] customers waiting in line.

a. If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately how many customers arrived in the past hour? To answer this question, we substitute [`C`] with [`[$y2r]`], and we have:

    [`` [$y2r]= [$func] ``]

    We will use a graphing calculator's [|solve()|]* function to solve this equation. For a TI-89, press [|Home|]*, [|F2|]*, choose [|solve(|]*, press [|Enter|]*. Then, type in the equation:

    [|solve([`[$y2r]`]=[`x`]^2/([$a2]-[$a]x),x)\}*

    For Casio ClassPad 300, tap [|Main|]*, [|Action|]* in the menu, [|Advanced|]*, [|solve|]*, and then type in the same equation above.

    Ignore the unreasonable solution, and round the reasonable solution to [`[$ans2]`].

    If there are [`[$y2r]`] customers waiting in line, approximately [`[$ans2]`] customers arrived in the past hour.
