BEGIN_PGML

The population of deer in a forest can be modeled by

    [``` P(x) = [$func] ```]

where [`x`] is the number of years since the year 1900.

a. How many deer lived in this forest in the year 1900?  
[__________]{$ans1}

a. How many deer live in this forest [`[$x2]`] years after 1900? [@KeyboardInstructions('Round your answer to an integer.')@]*  
[__________]{$ans2}

a. How many years since 1900 was it (or will it be) when the deer population was (or will be) [`[$y3]`]? [@KeyboardInstructions('Round your answer to an integer.')@]*  
[__________]{$ans3}

a. Use a calculator or graphing calculator to answer this question: As time goes on, the population levels off at about how many deer?  
[__________]{$eval4}

$s1 = $a*$x2+$b;
$s2 = $c*$x2+$d;

$s4 = $b-$y3*$d;
$s5 = $a*10000+$b;
$s6 = $c*10000+$d;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. How many deer live in this forest this year? To answer this question, we substitute [`x`] with [`0`], and we have:

    [`` P(0) = \frac{[$a](0)+[$b]}{[$c](0)+[$d]} = \frac{[$b]}{[$d]} = [$ans1] ``]

    About [`[$ans1]`] deer live in this forest this year.

a. How many deer will live in this forest [`[$x2]`] years later? To answer this question, we substitute [`x`] with [`[$x2]`], and we have:

    [`` P([$x2]) = \frac{[$a]([$x2])+[$b]}{[$c]([$x2])+[$d]} = \frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]} \approx [$ans2] ``]

    About [`[$ans2]`] deer will live in this forest [`[$x2]`] years later.

a. After how many years, the deer population will be [`[$y3]`]? To answer this question, we substitute [`P(x)`] with [`[$y3]`], and then solve for [`x`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   P(x) &= [$func] \\
   [$y3] &= [$func] \\
   [$y3] ([$c]x+[$d]) &= [$func]([$c]x+[$d]) \\
   [$y3*$c]x+[$y3*$d] &= [$a]x+[$b] \\
   [$y3*$c]x+[$y3*$d] \mathbf{{}-[$a]x-[$y3*$d]} &= [$a]x+[$b] \mathbf{{}-[$a]x-[$y3*$d]} \\
   [$s3]x &= [$s4] \\
   x &= [$s4/$s3] \\
   x &\approx [$ans3]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

    After about [`[$ans3]`] years, the deer population will be [`[$y3]`].

a. Use a graphing calculator to answer this question: _Very many_ years in the future, about how many deer will live in this forest? To answer this question, we substitute [`x`] with a very big number, like [`10{,}000`], and we have:

    [`` P(10000) = \frac{[$a](10000)+[$b]}{[$c](10000)+[$d]} = \frac{[$s5]}{[$s6]} \approx [$ans4] ``]

    Many years in the future, about [`[$ans4]`] deer will live in this forest.
