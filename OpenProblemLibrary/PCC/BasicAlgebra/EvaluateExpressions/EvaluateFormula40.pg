########Begin Load Macro Files############
#This section loads any and all .pl files that contain useful subroutines for the problem.

loadMacros(

########Begin Problem Setup############
#This is where you initialize variables and run computations

Context("LimitedNumeric");      
#Almost always declare the context right away. Here we are declaring the most basic context, Numeric.

#Create some random integers.
$a = random(3,99,3);     #a random number from 1 to 9 taking steps of size 1
$b = random(1,99,1);


$answer = NumberWithUnits((1/3)*$a**2*$b, "in^3");
#Create a Math Object Real that will be the problem's answer. This is much more intricate than a simple Perl scalar that would result from .

$s =NumberWithUnits($a,"in");
$h = NumberWithUnits($b, "in");

The formula [`V=\frac{1}{3}\cdot s^2\cdot h`] gives the volume of a right square pyramid.

What is the volume of a right square pyramid with [`s= [$s]`] and [`h=[$h]`]?
[%This is how to comment in PGML. Every variable that you reference needs to be encased in brackets, hence [$a]. Then, to use math mode we encase in [` `].%]

    [____________]{$answer}

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Because the volume formula is [`V=\frac{1}{3}s^2h`], [`s= [$s]`] and [`h=[$h]`], the values can be substituted into the formula as follows:

    [`V=\frac{1}{3}\cdot(\underline{[$s]})^2\cdot\underline{[$h]}`]
       

which is [`[$answer]`].
