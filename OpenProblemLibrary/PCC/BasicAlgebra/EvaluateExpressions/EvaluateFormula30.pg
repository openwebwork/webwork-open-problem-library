The formula [```y=\frac{1}{2}\,a\,t^2 +v_0\,t + y_0```] gives the vertical position of an object, at time [`t`], thrown with an initial velocity [`v_0`], from an initial position [`y_0`] in a place where the acceleration of gravity is [`a`]. The acceleration of gravity on earth is [`[$gU]`]. It is negative, because we consider the upward direction as positive in this situation, and gravity pulls down.

What is the height of a baseball thrown with an initial velocity of [`v_0=[$v0U]`], from an initial position of [`y_0= [$y0U]`], and at time [`t=[$tU]`]? 

[@KeyboardInstructions('In your answers to this problem, use [|m|] for meters, and [|s|] for seconds.')@]**

    [$tWord] [$seconds] after the baseball was thrown, it was [__________]{$heightU} high in the air.

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

These given values can be substituted into the formula as follows:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   y &= \frac{1}{2}\,a\,t^2 +v_0\,t + y_0 \\
     &= \frac{1}{2}\left([$gU]\right)([$tU])^{2} + \left([$v0U]\right)([$tU]) +[$y0U] \\
     &= [@$g*$t**2*0.5@] \text{ m} + [$v0*$t] \text{ m} + [$y0U] \\
     &= [$heightU]
\end{aligned}
``]

The baseball was [`[$heightU]`] high in the air.
