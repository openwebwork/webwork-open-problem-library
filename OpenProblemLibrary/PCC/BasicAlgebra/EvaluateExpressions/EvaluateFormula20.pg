########Begin Load Macro Files############
#This section loads any and all .pl files that contain useful subroutines for the problem.

########Begin Problem Setup############
#This is where you initialize variables and run computations

Context("LimitedNumeric");      
#Almost always declare the context right away. Here we are declaring the most basic context, Numeric.

#Create some random integers.
$a = random(3,99,3);     #a random number from 1 to 9 taking steps of size 1
$b = random(1,99,1);
$c = random(8,98,2);

$area = (.5)*$a*$b*$c;
$answer = NumberWithUnits((.5)*$a*$b*$c, "in^2");
#Create a Math Object Real that will be the problem's answer. This is much more intricate than a simple Perl scalar that would result from .

$s =NumberWithUnits($a,"in");
$r = NumberWithUnits($b, "in");



########Begin What the Student Sees############

The formula [`A=\frac{1}{2}\,r\,n\,s`] gives the area of a regular polygon with side length [`s`], number of sides [`n`] and, apothem [`r`]. (The _apothem_ is the distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.)

What is the area of a regular [`[$c]`]-gon with [`s= [$s]`] and [`r=[$r]`]?

[___________]{$answer}

########Begin more complicated answer processing (if needed)############

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The values can be substituted into the formula as follows:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   A &= \frac{1}{2}\,r\,n \,s \\
     &= \frac{1}{2}([$r])([$c])([$s]) \\
     &= [$answer]
\end{aligned}
``]

The pentagon's area is [`[$answer]`].
