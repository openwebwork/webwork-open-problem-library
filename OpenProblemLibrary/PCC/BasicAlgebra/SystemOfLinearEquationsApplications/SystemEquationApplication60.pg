BEGIN_PGML

You will purchase some CDs and DVDs. If you purchase [`[$c1]`] CDs and [`[$d1]`] DVDs, it will cost you [`[$cCost1]`]; if you purchase [`[$c2]`] CDs and [`[$d2]`] DVDs, it will cost you [`[$cCost2]`]. Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following questions.

    Each CD costs [__________]{$cCD} and each DVD costs [___________]{$cDVD}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume each CD costs [`x`] dollars, and each DVD costs [`y`] dollars.

Since each CD costs [`x`] dollars, [`[$c1]`] CDs cost [`[$c1]x`] dollars.

Similarly, since each DVD costs [`y`] dollars, [`[$d1]`] DVDs cost [`[$d1]y`] dollars.

It's given that [`[$c1]`] CDs and [`[$d1]`] DVDs cost [`[$cCost1]`]. Now we can write the first equation:

    [`` [$c1]x+[$d1]y=[$rCost1] ``]

Similarly, the second equation is:

    [`` [$c2]x+[$d2]y=[$rCost2] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$c1]x+[$d1]y &= [$rCost1]\\
  [$c2]x+[$d2]y &= [$rCost2]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We use elimination to solve this system of equations. To eliminate [`x`], we multiply each side of [` [$c1]x+[$d1]y=[$rCost1] `] by [`[$c2]`], and multiply each side of [` [$c2]x+[$d2]y=[$rCost2] `] by [`-[$c1]`]. We have:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$s1]x +[$s2]y  &= [$s3] \\
  -[$s1]x -[$s4]y &= -[$s5]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Adding left sides together and right sides together, and then solving for [`y`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
  [$output]
  y   &= [$rDVD]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`y=[$rDVD]`] into [` [$c1]x+[$d1]y = [$rCost1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$c1]x+[$d1]y &= [$rCost1] \\
  [$c1]x+[$d1] \cdot [$rDVD] &= [$rCost1] \\
  [$c1]x+[$s8] &= [$rCost1] \\
  [$c1]x+[$s8] \mathbf{{}-[$s8]}  &= [$rCost1] \mathbf{{}-[$s8]} \\
  [$c1]x &= [$s9] \\
  \frac{[$c1]x}{[$c1]} &= \frac{[$s9]}{[$c1]} \\
  x   &= [$rCD]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$rCD],[$rDVD])`]. This implies that each CD costs [`[$cCD]`], and each DVD costs [`[$cDVD]`].
