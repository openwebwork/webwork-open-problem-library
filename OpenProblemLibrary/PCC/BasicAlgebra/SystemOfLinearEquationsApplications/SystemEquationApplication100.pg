BEGIN_PGML

If a boat travels from Town A to Town B, it has to travel [`[$distanceU]`] along a river. A boat traveled from Town A to Town B along the river's current with its engine running at full speed. This trip took [`[$time1U]`]. Then the boat traveled back from Town B to Town A, again with the engine at full speed, but this time against the river's current. This trip took [`[$time2U]`]. Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following questions.

    The boat's speed in still water with the engine running at full speed is [______________]{$speedStillU}.

    The river current's speed was [______________]{$speedCurrentU}.

$s1= $speedStill+$speedCurrent;
$s2= $speedStill-$speedCurrent;
$s3 = $s1+$s2;

if ($s2!=1) {
   $output = " $s2 y &= $s3 \\".
             " \frac{$s2 y}{$s2} &= \frac{$s3}{$s2} \\";

else {$output = "";}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the boat's speed in still water was [`x`] miles per hour, and the river current's speed was [`y`] miles per hour.

Thus, the boat's actual speed when it traveled from Town A to Town B was [`x+y`] miles per hour; its actual speed when it traveled from Town B back to Town A was [`x-y`] miles per hour.

By the formula:

    [`` (\text{time}) \cdot (\text{speed}) = \text{distance} ``],

we can write a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$time1](x+y)  &= [$distance] \\
  [$time2](x-y)  &= [$distance]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Simplify this system of equations by dividing [`[$time1]`] into both sides of the first equation, and dividing [`[$time2]`] into both sides of the second equation. We have:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x+y  &= [$s1] \\
  x-y  &= [$s2]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Adding left sides together and right sides together, and then solving for [`x`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  2x &= [$s3] \\
  \frac{2x}{2} &= \frac{[$s3]}{2} \\
  x   &= [$speedStill]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`y=[$speedStill]`] into [` x+y = [$s1] `], and we have [`y=[$speedCurrent]`].

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$speedStill],[$speedCurrent])`]. This implies that the boat's speed in still water would have been [`[$speedStillU]`], and the river current's speed was [`[$speedCurrentU]`].
