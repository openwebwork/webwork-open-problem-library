BEGIN_PGML
The sum of two integers is [`[$e]`]. The difference of the same 
numbers is [`[$f]`].

Find the two numbers.

    The numbers are [_______] and [_______].

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION 
Let's define [`x`] to be the first number, and [`y`] to be second number.

From the given information, we can construct the following system 
of linear equations

    [`\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.`]

    Note that the first equation is from the information about the *sum* 
    of the numbers, and the second equation is from the information about 
    the _difference_ of the numbers.

Let's solve the system using the following steps:
* We can *add* the two equations to eliminate [`y`]; this gives 

        [`2x=[$e+$f]`] 
  
      so [`x=[$x]`].
* Now that we have [`x`], we find [`y`] using either equation; let's use 
    the _first_ equation: 

       [`\begin{aligned}
        y&=[$e]-([$x])\\
         &=[$y]
        \end{aligned}`]
* At this stage we have values for [`x`] and [`y`]; you should check that they 
satisfy the original system of equations (exercise).

We conclude that one of the numbers is [`[$x]`] and the other is [`[$y]`].
