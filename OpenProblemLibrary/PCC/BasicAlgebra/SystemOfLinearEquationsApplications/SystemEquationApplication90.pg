BEGIN_PGML

Company A's revenue this fiscal year is [`[$cSalesA]`], but its revenue is decreasing by [`[$cRateA]`] each year. Company B's revenue this fiscal year is [`[$cSalesB]`], and its revenue is increasing by [`[$cRateB]`] each year. Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following question.

    After [___________]{$years} years, Company B will catch up with Company A in revenue.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let [`x`] be a number of years that will have passed since this year. Let [`y`] be a company's revenue [`x`] years from now.

We can model Company A's revenue by [`y= -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA]`].

We can model Company B's revenue by by [`y=[$rRateB]x+[$rSalesB]`].

To find when these two companies will have the same revenue, we can write a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  y &= -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA]\\
  y &=[$rRateB]x+[$rSalesB]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

It's easier to use substitution to solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we have [`y= -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA]`]. In the second equation, we can substitute [`y`] with [` -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned} [t]
  -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA] &=[$rRateB]x+[$rSalesB] \\
  -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA] \mathbf{{}-[$rSalesA]} &=[$rRateB]x+[$rSalesB] \mathbf{{}-[$rSalesA]} \\
  -[$rRateA]x &= [$rRateB]x +[$s1] \\
  -[$rRateA]x \mathbf{{}-[$rRateB]x} &= [$rRateB]x +[$s1] \mathbf{{}-[$rRateB]x} \\
  [$s2] x &= [$s1] \\ 
  \frac{[$s2]x}{[$s2]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{[$s2]} \\
  x &= [$years]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`x=[$years]`] into [`y = -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned} [t]
   y &= -[$rRateA]x+[$rSalesA] \\
   y &= -[$rRateA] \cdot [$years]+[$rSalesA] \\
   y &= [$rSameSales]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$years],[$rSameSales])`]. This implies that [`[$years]`] years later, both companies will have the same revenue: [`[$cSameSales]`].
