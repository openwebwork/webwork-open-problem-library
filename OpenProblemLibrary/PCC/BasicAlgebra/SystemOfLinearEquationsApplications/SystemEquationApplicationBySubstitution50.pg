BEGIN_PGML

Town A and Town B were located close to each other, and recently merged into one city. Town A had a population with [`[$p1]%`] [$ethnicity]. Town B had a population with [`[$p2]%`] [$ethnicity]. After the merge, the new city has a total of [`[$s3]`] residents, with [`[$p3]%`] [$ethnicity]. How many residents did Town A and Town B used to have?

Write and solve a system equation to answer the following questions.

    Town A used to have [__________]{$s1} residents, and Town B used to have [__________]{$s2} residents.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume Town A used to have [`x`] residents, and Town B used to have [`y`] residents.

It's given that the merged city has [`[$s3]`] residents, so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$s3] ``]

Since Town A used to have [`[$p1]%`]  [$ethnicity] out of [`x`] residents, the number of [$ethnicity] in Town A was [`[$dp1]x`].

Similarly, since Town B used to have [`[$p2]%`] [$ethnicity] out of [`y`] residents, the number of [$ethnicity] in Town B was [`[$dp2]y`].

After the merge, the new city has [`[$p3]%`] [$ethnicity] out of [`[$s3]`] residents, so the number of [$ethnicity] in the new city was [`[$dp3] \cdot [$s3] = [$step3] `]. Now we can write another equation:

    [`` [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y= [$step3] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$s3] \\
  [$dp1]x+[$dp2]y &= [$step3]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We will use substitution to solve this problem. First, we solve for [`y`] in the first equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   x+y &= [$s3] \\
   x+y \mathbf{{}-x} &= [$s3]\mathbf{{}-x} \\
   y &= -x+[$s3]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Next, we substitute [`y`] with [`-x+[$s3]`] in [`[$dp1]x +[$dp2]y = [$step3]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$dp1]x +[$dp2]y &= [$step3] \\
   [$dp1]x +[$dp2](-x+[$s3]) &= [$step3] \\
   [$dp1]x -[$dp2]x+[$dp2*$s3] &= [$step3] \\
   [$dp1-$dp2]x +[$dp2*$s3] &= [$step3] \\
   [$dp1-$dp2]x +[$dp2*$s3] \mathbf{{}-[$dp2*$s3]} &= [$step3] \mathbf{{}-[$dp2*$s3]} \\
   [$dp1-$dp2]x &= [$s4] \\
   x &= [$s1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Finally, we substitute [`x=[$s1]`] into [`y = -x+[$s3]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   y &= -x+[$s3] \\
   y &= -[$s1]+[$s3] \\
   y &= [$s2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The solution to the system of equations is [`x=[$s1],y=[$s2]`]. This implies Town A used to have [`[$s1]`] residents, and Town B used to have [`[$s2]`] residents.
