BEGIN_PGML
A small fair charges different admission for adults and children. It charges [`[$currency_adult]`] for adults, and [`[$currency_child]`] for children. On a certain day, the total revenue is [`[$currency_f]`] and the fair admits [`[$e]`] people. How many adults and children were admitted?

    There were [__________]{$ans1} adults and [____________]{$ans2} children at the fair.

END_PGML


# x + by = e should be solved for x
# provided that $a and $c are not equal- in this case we should use subtraction.
$rhs=Formula("$e-$b*y")->reduce;
$lhs=Formula("$c*$e-$c*$b*y+$d*y")->reduce;
Context()->flags->set(reduceConstants=>0);
$rhsSub = $rhs->substitute(y=>Formula("$y"));


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION 
Let's define [`x`] to be the number of adults who attended the fair, 
and [`y`] to be number of children who attended the fair (you may have 
used other letters, perhaps [`a`] and [`c`], for example).

From the given information, we can construct the following system 
of linear equations

    [`\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.`]

    Note that the first equation is from the information about the total 
    number of people, and the second equation is from the total money taken.

Let's solve the system using the following steps:
* From the first equation we see that [`x=[$rhs]`], which we substitute into the _second_ 
equation and solve for [`y`].
* This gives [`[$lhs]=[$f]`] so [`y=[$y]`].
* Now that we have [`y`], we find [`x`] using the _first_ equation: 

      [`\begin{aligned}
        x&=[$rhsSub]\\
         &=[$x]
        \end{aligned}`]
* At this stage we have values for [`x`] and [`y`]; you should check that they 
satisfy the original system of equations (exercise).

We conclude that [`[$x]`] adults and [`[$y]`] children attended the fair.
