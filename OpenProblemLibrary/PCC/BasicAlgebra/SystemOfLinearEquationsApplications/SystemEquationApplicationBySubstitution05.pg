BEGIN_PGML

A rectangle's length is [`[$bAbs]`] feet [$moreOrLess] than [$multiText] its width. The rectangle's perimeter is [`[$p]`] feet. Find the rectangle's length and width.

The rectangle's length is [________]{$l} feet, and its width is [________]{$w} feet.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the rectangle's length is [`l`] feet, and its width is [`w`] feet.

A rectangle's perimeter can be calculated by [`P=2(l+w)`], where [`P`] stands for perimeter, [`l`] stands for length and [`w`] stands for width.

Based on the given conditions, we can write the following equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  l &= [$m]w+[$b] \\
  2(l+w) &= [$p]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

To solve this system of equations, we substitute [`l=[$m]w+[$b]`] into the second equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   2(l+w) &= [$p] \\
   2([$m]w+[$b]+w) &= [$p] \\
   2([$s1]w+[$b]) &= [$p] \\
   [$s2]w+[$s3] &= [$p] \\
   [$s2]w+[$s3] \mathbf{{}-[$s3]} &= [$p] \mathbf{{}-[$s3]} \\
   [$s2]w &= [$s4] \\
   w &= [$w]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Next, we substitute [`w=[$w]`] into [`l = [$m]w+[$b]`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   l &= [$m]w+[$b] \\
   l &= [$m]([$w])+[$b] \\
   l &= [$m*$w]+[$b] \\
   l &= [$l]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The rectangle's length is [`[$l]`] feet, and its width is [`[$w]`] feet.
