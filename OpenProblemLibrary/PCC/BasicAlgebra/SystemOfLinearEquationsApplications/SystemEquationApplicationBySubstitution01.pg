BEGIN_PGML

The sum of two numbers is [`[$sum]`]. One number is [`[$less]`] less than [$word] of the other number. 

Write and solve a system equation to answer the following questions.

    The bigger number is [__________]{$bigger} and the smaller number is [__________]{$smaller}.

$s1 = $times+1;
$s2 = $sum+$less;
$s3 = $s2/$s1;
$s4 = $times*$s3-$less;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume one number is [`x`], and the other number is [`y`].

Based on the given information, we can set up a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
   x+y &= [$sum] \\
   y &= [$times]x-[$less]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Since [`y`] is alone on one side of the second equation, we will use the substitution method to solve this system.

We substitute [`y = [$times]x-[$less]`] into [`x+y = [$sum]`], and we have:

    [``\begin{aligned}
   x+ ([$times]x-[$less]) &= [$sum] \\
   [$s1]x-[$less] &= [$sum] \\
   [$s1]x &= [$sum]+[$less] \\
   [$s1]x &= [$s2] \\
   x &= \frac{[$s2]}{[$s1]} \\
   x &= [$s3]
\end{aligned}``]

Next, we substitute [`x=[$s3]`] into [`y = [$times]x-[$less]`], and we have:

    [``\begin{aligned}
   y &= [$times]x-[$less] \\
   y &= [$times]([$s3]) -[$less] \\
   y &= [$s4]
\end{aligned}``]

The bigger number is [`[$bigger]`] and the smaller number is [`[$smaller]`].
