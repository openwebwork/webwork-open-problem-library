BEGIN_PGML

A test has [`[$totalProblems]`] problems, which are worth a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points. There are two types of problems in the test. Each multiple-choice problem is worth [`[$worthMulti]`] points, and each short-answer problem is worth [`[$worthShort]`] points. Write and solve a system of equations to answer the following questions.

    This test has [__________]{$numMulti} multiple-choice problems and [___________]{$numShort} short-answer problems.

$s1=-$worthMulti*$totalProblems;
$s2=$worthShort-$worthMulti;
$s3 = $totalPoints + $s1;

if ($s2!=1) {
   $output = " $s2 y &= $s3 \\".
             " \frac{$s2 y}{$s2} &= \frac{$s3}{$s2} \\";
}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the test has [`x`] multiple-choice problems, and [`y`] short-answer problems.

It's given that there are a total of [`[$totalProblems]`] problems, so we have:

    [`` x+y=[$totalProblems] ``]

Since each multiple-choice problem is worth [`[$worthMulti]`] points, [`x`] multiple-choice problems would be worth [`[$worthMulti]x`] points.

Similarly, since each short-answer problem is worth [`[$worthShort]`] points, [`y`] short-answer problems would be worth [`[$worthShort]y`] points.

It's given that all problems in the test are worth a total of [`[$totalPoints]`] points, so we have:

    [`` [$worthMulti]x+[$worthShort]y=[$totalPoints] ``]

Now we have a system of equations:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  x              + y             &= [$totalProblems] \\
  [$worthMulti]x +[$worthShort]y &= [$totalPoints]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

We use elimination to solve this system of equations. To eliminate [`x`], we multiply each side of [` x + y = [$totalProblems] `] by [`-[$worthMulti]`], and we have:

    [``\left\{\begin{aligned}
  -[$worthMulti]x -[$worthMulti]y  &= [$s1] \\
  [$worthMulti]x +[$worthShort]y &= [$totalPoints]
\end{aligned}\right.``]

Adding left sides together and right sides together, and then solving for [`y`], we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$output]
  y   &= [$numShort]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

Substitute [`y=[$numShort]`] into [` x+y=[$totalProblems] `], and we have [`x=[$numMulti]`].

The solution to the system of equations is [`([$numMulti],[$numShort])`]. This implies that there are [`[$numMulti]`] multiple-choice questions and [`[$numShort]`] short-answer questions in the test.
