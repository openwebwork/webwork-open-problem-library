#
# Solve the system of linear equations
#     a x + b y = e
#     c x + d y = f
# where a, b, c, d are (positive) integer values on the interval [1,5]
#
# We choose ad - bc = 0, so that there are INFINITELY many solutions to the system.

BEGIN_PGML
Solve the following system of equations.

[```\left\{\begin{aligned}
  [$topLeft] & =  [$e] \\
  [$botLeft] & =  [$f] 
\end{aligned}\right.```]

[@KeyboardInstructions('If there is one solution, enter it as an ordered pair. If there is no solution, enter [|no solution|]*. If there is an infinite number of solutions, enter [|infinite number of solutions|]*.')@]**

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION 
* If we solve each equation for [`y`] then we obtain

    [`
     \begin{aligned}
      y & = [$top] \\
      y& = [$bot]
    \end{aligned}
    `]

* We immediately observe that the lines are _parallel_ since they have the same slopes. 
* We also note that the lines have _the same_ vertical intercepts.
* We conclude that since the equations represent the same lines, that there are *infinitely many solutions* to this
system.
* Note that you may have attempted this problem using another method, perhaps trying the 
method of elimination or substitution.
