BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

If a point is a solution to a system of equations, it implies that the point is on both lines.

To decide whether or not a given point is a solution to a system of linear equations, we need to know whether the point is on both lines or not.

Substitute the point [`\left([$x],[$y]\right)`] into the first equation, and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$func1] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$c] \\
   [$firstEquationSubstitute] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$c] \\
   [$firstEquationValue] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$c]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

This is true, so [`\left([$x],[$y]\right)`] is on the line [` [$func1]=[$c] `].

Next, we substitute [`\left([$x],[$y]\right)`] into the second equation, and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$func2] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$f] \\
   [$secondEquationSubstitute] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$f] \\
   [$secondEquationValue] &\stackrel{?}{=} [$f]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

This is also true, so [`\left([$x],[$y]\right)`] is on the line [` [$func2]=[$f] `].

Since [`\left([$x],[$y]\right)`] is on both lines, [`\left([$x],[$y]\right)`] is a solution to the system of equations.
