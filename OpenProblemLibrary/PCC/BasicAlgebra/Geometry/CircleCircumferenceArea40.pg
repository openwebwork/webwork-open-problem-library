Context("Numeric");
# An earlier version of this problem required rounding to hundredths place.
# Bad, because when some students use 3.14 instead of something closer to pi,
# they could be marked incorrect. Using relative tolerance in the usual way
# means it is OK to use 3.14 in place of pi. If students are now not showing
# enough digits and being marked incorrect, that should be handled globally,
# not in the problem code. For exampl, more studnet education about rounding
# explectations, or a tooltip that always reminds students of the roudning 
# convention.

BEGIN_PGML

A circle's circumference is [`[$circumU]`]. 

a. What is this circle's diameter?  
   [_]{$diameterU}{15}

a. What is this circle's radius?  
   [_]{$radiusU}{15}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We use [`r`] to represent radius, and [`d`] to represent diameter.

A circle's circumference formula is [` C= \pi d `] or [` C= 2 \pi r `].

When you enter [`\pi`]'s value in a calculator, don't round it to [`3.14`]. Use the [`\pi`] button on your calculator instead. This way, your result is more accurate.

a.  To find the diameter, we substitute the given numbers into the first formula for circumference:

    [```
\begin{aligned}
      C & = \pi d \\
    [$circum] & = \pi d \\
    \frac{[$circum]}{\pi} &= \frac{\pi d}{\pi} \\
    \frac{[$circum]}{3.1415926 \ldots} &= d \\
    [$diameter] & \approx d
\end{aligned}
    ```]

    This circle's diameter is approximately [`[$diameterU]`]. Don't forget the length unit [`\textrm{cm}`].

a.  Once we find the diameter, the radius is simply half of it: [`[$radiusU]`].
