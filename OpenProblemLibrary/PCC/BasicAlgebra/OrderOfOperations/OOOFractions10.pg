########Begin Load Macro Files############
#This section loads any and all .pl files that contain useful subroutines for the problem.

#This is where you initialize variables and run computations

########Begin What the Student Sees############

TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Evaluate the following.

    [``[$frac1] + [$frac2] \div [$frac3] - [$frac4]=``][_____]{$answer}

END_PGML

########Begin more complicated answer processing (if needed)############

#Not needed in this template.

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

$com = lcm(lcm($b,$h),$denM);

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We must follow the order of operations when simplifying this expression. Begin by doing the division.

     
[``
\begin{aligned}[t]
[$frac1] + [$frac2] \div [$frac3] - [$frac4]&=[$frac1] + [$frac2] \cdot [$frac3_2] - [$frac4]\\
&=[$frac1]+[$frac2_div_frac3]-[$frac4]\\ 
 &= \frac{[$num1]}{[$com]} + \frac{[$num2]}{[$com]} - \frac{[$num3]}{[$com]} \\
   &= \frac{[$numAns]}{[$denAns]}
\end{aligned}
