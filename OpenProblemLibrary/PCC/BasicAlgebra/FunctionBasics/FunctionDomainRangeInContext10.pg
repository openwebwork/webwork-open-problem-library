BEGIN_PGML

[$name] bought a used car for [`[$y0C]`]. The car's value decreases at a constant rate each year. After [`[$x1]`] years, the value decreased to [`[$y1C]`].

Use a function to model the car's value as the number of years increases. Find this function's domain and range in this context.

    The function's domain in this context is [___________]{$domain}.

    The function's range in this context is [___________]{$range}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

##Find the function's equation.

A linear function looks like [`f(x)=mx+b`], where [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the line's [`y`]-intercept. In this context, the value of [`x`] represents the number of years passed since the purchase, and the value of [`f(x)`] represents the car's value in dollars.

It's given that the car was bought at [`[$y0C]`], implying the first point on the line is [`([$x0],[$y0])`].

It's given that the car was worth [`[$y1C]`] after [`[$x1]`] years, implying the second point on the line is [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

Now, we can use the slope formula to find the line's slope:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y1]-[$y0]}{[$x1]-[$x0]}\\&=\frac{[$y1-$y0]}{[$x1-$x0]}\\&=[$slope] \end{aligned}``]

This implies the car's value decreases at [`[$slopeC]`] per year.

Now the function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+b`].

The point [`([$x0],[$y0])`] implies the line's [`y`]-intercept is [`[$y0]`], so the function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+[$y0]`].

##Determine the function's domain

Without a context, a linear function's domain and range are typically all real numbers (except vertical and horizontal lines). However, in this context, it makes no sense to deal with negative years or negative dollars. We need to limit the domain and range, so the number would make sense.

The domain represents the number of years passed. The [`x`] value starts at [`0`], which represents the year when the car was purchased. It ends when the car's value becomes [`\$0`]. We need to solve an equation to find when that will happen. We substitute the value of [`f(x)`] with [`0`], and then solve for [`x`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   f(x) &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \\
   0    &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \\
   0 \mathbf{-[$y0]}   &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \mathbf{-[$y0]}\\
   -[$y0] &= [$slope]x \\
   \frac{-[$y0]}{[$slope]} &= \frac{[$slope]x}{[$slope]} \\
   [$x2] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

When the value of [`x`] is greater than [`[$x2]`], [`f(x)`]'s value would become negative, which would not make sense in this context. Thus, the domain of the function is [`[$domain]`].

##Determine the function's range

The car's maximum value is at [`[$y0C]`] when it was first purchased, and then decreased to [`\$0`] after [`[$x2]`] years. Thus, the range of the function is [`[$range]`].
