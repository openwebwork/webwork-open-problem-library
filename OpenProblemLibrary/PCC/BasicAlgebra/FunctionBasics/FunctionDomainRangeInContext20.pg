BEGIN_PGML

Assume a car uses gas at a constant rate. After driving [`[$x1]`] miles since a full tank of gas was purchased, there was [`[$y1]`] gallons of gas left; after driving [`[$x2]`] miles since a full tank of gas was purchased, there was [`[$y2]`] gallons of gas left.

Use a function to model the amount of gas in the tank (in gallons). Let the independent variable be the number of miles driven since a full tank of gas was purchased. Find this function's domain and range in this context.

    The function's domain in this context is [___________]{$domain}.

    The function's range in this context is [___________]{$range}.

$absSlope = abs($slope);

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

##Find the function's equation.

A linear function looks like [`f(x)=mx+b`], where [`m`] is the line's slope, and [`b`] is the line's [`y`]-intercept. In this context, the value of [`x`] represents the number of miles driven since the tank was full, and the value of [`f(x)`] represents the amount of gas, in gallons, left in the tank.

It's given that there were [`[$y1]`] gallons of gas left after driving [`[$x1]`] miles, implying the first point on the line is [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

It's given that there were [`[$y2]`] gallons of gas left after driving [`[$x2]`] miles, implying the first point on the line is [`([$x2],[$y2])`].

Now, we can use the slope formula to find the line's slope:

    [`` \begin{aligned}\text{slope}&=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\&=\frac{[$y2]-[$y1]}{[$x2]-[$x1]}\\&=\frac{[$y2-$y1]}{[$x2-$x1]}\\&=[$slope] \end{aligned}``]

This implies the car uses [`[$absSlope]`] gallon of gas for each mile driven.

Now the function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+b`].

To find the line's [`y`]-intercept, there are two methods.

###First method to find [`y`]-intercept

We substitute one of the given points into [` f(x)=[$slope]x+b `].  We choose to use [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  f(x) &= [$slope]x + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$slope] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$slope*$x1] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$slope*$x1]} &= [$slope*$x1] + b\mathbf{{}-[$slope*$x1]} \\
  [$y0] &= b\\
  b &= [$y0]
\end{aligned}
`]

The function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+[$y0]`]. Its [`y`]-intercept, [`[$y0]`], represents the amount of gas when the tank was full.

###Second method to find [`y`]-intercept

We use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, we choose to use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$slope](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$slope]x+[$slope] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$slope]x+[$absSlope*$x1] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$slope]x+[$absSlope*$x1] \mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$slope]x+[$y0]
\end{aligned}
`]

The function's equation is [`f(x)=[$slope]x+[$y0]`].

##Determine the function's domain

Without a context, a linear function's domain and range are typically all real numbers (except vertical and horizontal lines). However, in this context, it makes no sense to deal with negative amount of gas or negative miles. We need to limit the domain and range, so the numbers would make sense.

The domain represents the amount of gas in the tank. The [`x`] value starts at [`0`], implying [`0`] mile was driven when the tank was full. The [`x`] value ends when all gas in the tank is used up. We need to solve an equation to find when that will happen. We substitute the value of [`f(x)`] with [`0`], and then solve for [`x`]:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
   f(x) &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \\
   0    &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \\
   0 \mathbf{-[$y0]}   &=[$slope]x+[$y0] \mathbf{-[$y0]}\\
   -[$y0] &= [$slope]x \\
   \frac{-[$y0]}{[$slope]} &= \frac{[$slope]x}{[$slope]} \\
   [$x3] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

When the value of [`x`] is greater than [`[$x3]`], [`f(x)`]'s value would become negative, which would not make sense in this context. Thus, the domain of the function is [`[$domain]`].

##Determine the function's range

The maximum amount of gas in the tank is [`[$y0]`], when the tank was full, and then decreased to [`0`] after driving [`[$x3]`] miles. Thus, the range of the function is [`[$range]`].
