BEGIN_PGML

A rectangle's length is [`[$b]`] yards less than [`[$a]`] times of its width. If the rectangle's perimeter must be between [`[$small]`] and [`[$big]`] yards, what is the range of its width? Use an inequality to solve this problem.

*Solution*: The rectangle's width must be between [__________]{$ans1} yards (smaller value) and [__________]{$ans2} yards (bigger value).

$t1 = 2*$a+2;
$t2 = $b*2;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the rectangle's width is [`w`] yards, then its length is [`[$a]w-[$b]`] yards, and its perimeter is:

    [`` 2([$a]w-[$b])+2w = [$t1]w-[$t2] ``] yards.

Since the rectangle's perimeter is limited to [`[$small]`] and [`[$big]`] yards, we can write an inequality and then solve it:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$small] &\le [$t1]w-[$t2] \le [$big] \\
  [$small] \mathbf{+[$t2]} &\le [$t1]w-[$t2] \mathbf{+[$t2]}   \le [$big] \mathbf{+[$t2]} \\
  [$small+$t2] & \le [$t1]w \le [$big+$t2] \\
  \frac{[$small+2*$b]}{[$t1]} & \le \frac{[$t1]w}{[$t1]} \le \frac{[$big+2*$b]}{[$t1]} \\
  [$ans1] &\le w \le [$ans2]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

*Solution*: The rectangle's width must be between [`[$ans1]`] yards (smaller value) and [`[$ans2]`] yards (bigger value).
