[%Not using percentages to avoid confusion%]
Your grade in a class is determined by the average of three test scores. You scored [`[$a]`] and [`[$b]`] on the first two tests. To earn at least [`[$m]`] for this course, how much do you have to score on the third test?

Let [`x`] be the score you will earn on the third test. Write an inequality to represent this situation. 

Your inequality has three parts, a left side, a right side, and a comparison operator in the middle: [`<`], [`>`], [`\leq`], [`\geq`], [`=`], or [`\neq`]. Enter these as *<*, *>*, *<=*, *>=*, *=*, and *!=*.

>> [__________]{$multians} [__]{$multians} [__________]{$multians} <<

Solve this inequality. What is the minimum that you have to earn on the third test in order to earn a [`[$m]`] for the course? 

    [___________]{$ans2}

You cannot score over [`100`] on the third test. Use interval notation to represent the range of scores you can earn on the third test in order to earn at least [`[$m]`] for this course.

    [______________]{$interval}

Let [`x`] be the score you will earn on the third test. 

    [`
\begin{aligned}
   \frac{[$a]+[$b]+x}{3} & \geq  [$m] \\
   3 \cdot \frac{[$a]+[$b]+x}{3} & \geq  3 \cdot [$m] \\
   [$a]+[$b]+x & \geq  [$s1] \\
   [$s2] +x & \geq  [$s1] \\
   [$s2] +x \mathbf{{}-[$s2]}& \geq  [$s1]\mathbf{{}-[$s2]} \\
          x  & \geq  [$ans2]
\end{aligned}
`]

You have to score at least [`[$ans2]`] on the third test in order to earn [`[$m]`] in this course.

To earn at least [`[$m]`] in this course, the interval for your score on the third test is [`[$interval]`].
