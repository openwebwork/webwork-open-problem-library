BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. Since all whole numbers belong to integers, we cannot write any whole number which is not an integer. Type [|DNE|]* (does not exist) for this question.

a. Any negative integer, like [`-1`], is not a whole number, but is an integer.

a. Any terminating decimal, like [`1.2`], is a rational number, but is not an integer.

a. [`\pi`] is the easiest number to remember as an irrational number. Another constant worth knowing is [`e\approx2.718`]. Finally, the square root of most integers are irrational, like [`\sqrt{2}`] and [`\sqrt{3}`].

a. All irrational numbers are non-repeating and non-terminating decimals. No irrational numbers are integers.
