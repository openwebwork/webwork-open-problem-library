########Begin What the Student Sees############

TEXT(beginproblem());
# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Choose [`<`], [`>`], or [`=`] to make a true statement.

    [``-\frac{[$pos_a]}{[$b]}``] [__]{$popup} [``-\frac{[$pos_c]}{[$d]}``]

END_PGML

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

To see which side is greater, rewrite both fractions with a common denominator. The least common denominator here is [`[$lcd]`]. Using this common
denominator, the problem becomes

[``-\frac{[$pos_numer_left]}{[$lcd]}\; \fbox{?}\; {-\frac{[$pos_numer_right]}{[$lcd]}}``]

and we now need to compare numerators. Since [`[$neg_numer_left] [$answer] [$neg_numer_right]`], we conclude that

[``-\frac{[$pos_a]}{[$b]} [$answer] -\frac{[$pos_c]}{[$d]}``].
