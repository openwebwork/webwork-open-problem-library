# Best practices always include this command here. It is responsible for the gray box around the problem, problem enumeration, and the path to the source .pg file.

#Current best practice is to use the PGML environment to write the body.
BEGIN_PGML

Choose [`<`], [`>`], or [`=`] to make a true statement.

    [`[$frac1] \div [$frac2]`] [@$popup->menu()@]* [`\frac{[$c1]}{[$d1]} - \frac{[$c]}{[$d]}`]

END_PGML

ANS( $popup->cmp(correct_ans_latex_string => '\gt') );

########Begin answer hints.############

#Not used in this template. For the PCC coding projects, I think that this feature will rarely be used the first go-around.

########Begin solution.############

#The walk-through solution is presented to students after the due date, and may soon also be used with a "show me how to do this" button that gives a walk-through for a similar but randomly generated problem.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

On the left side, we see a fraction divided by itself. Any number (except 0) divided by itself is 1.

On the right side, we notice that the first fraction can be reduced:

    [`` \frac{[$c1]}{[$d1]} = \frac{[$c]}{[$d]} ``]

So the right side becomes:

    [``
\begin{aligned}[t]
\frac{[$c1]}{[$d1]} - \frac{[$c]}{[$d]} &=\frac{[$c]}{[$d]} - \frac{[$c]}{[$d]}\\
 &=0 \\
\end{aligned}
``]

Now we can see the left side expression is greater than the right side. That is, [`[$frac1] \div [$frac2]`] > [`\frac{[$c1]}{[$d1]} - \frac{[$c]}{[$d]}`], because [`1>0`].
