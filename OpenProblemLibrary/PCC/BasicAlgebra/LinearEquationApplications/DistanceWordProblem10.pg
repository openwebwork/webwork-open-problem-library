BEGIN_PGML

[$nameA] drives [`[$r1]`] miles per hour. [$nameB] drives [`[$r2]`] miles per hour. They started at the same spot, and drove in opposite directions. After some time, they were [`[$d]`] miles apart. How much time has passed?

    After [_______]{$t} hours, [$nameA] and [$nameB] were [`[$d]`] miles apart.

$s1 = $r1+$r2;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
The relevant formula is:

\[\text{rate}\cdot\text{time} = \text{distance}\]

$PAR
Let's represent the unknown time by \(t\).  We use a table to organize the quantities (rate, time, and distance) for each of the individuals:
$PAR

\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Rate",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Time",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Distance",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"$nameA",header=>"RH"},"\($r1\)","$SPACE","\(t\)","$SPACE","\($r1 t\)"],
[{data=>"$nameB",header=>"RH"},"\($r2\)","$SPACE","\(t\)","$SPACE","\($r2 t\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  


$PAR

On the one hand the table shows us that the total distance between the two vehicles is \($r1 x+$r2 x\) miles. We also know that at time \(t\) they are  \($d\) miles apart. Now we can write an equation and solve it:
$PAR

\[
\begin{aligned}[t]
   $r1 x + $r2 x &= $d \\
   $s1 x &= $d \\
   \frac{$s1 x}{$s1} &= \frac{$d}{$s1} \\
   x &= $t \\
\end{aligned}
\]

$PAR

So after \($t\) hours, those two cars were \($d\) miles apart.
