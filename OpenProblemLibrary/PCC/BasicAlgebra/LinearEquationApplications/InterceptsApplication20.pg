BEGIN_PGML

[$name] is buying some tea bags and some sugar bags. Each tea bag costs [`[$a]`] cents, and each sugar bag costs [`[$b]`] cents. [@ucfirst($pronoun)@]* can spend a total of [`[$cC]`].

Assume [$name] will purchase [`x`] tea bags and [`y`] sugar bags. Use a linear equation to model the number of tea bags and sugar bags [$pronoun] can purchase.

Find this line's [`y`]-intercept, and interpret its meaning in this context.

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [$name] will purchase [`x`] tea bags and [`y`] sugar bags.

Since each tea bag costs [`[$a]`] cents, [`x`] tea bags would cost [`[$a] x`] cents.

Similarly, [`y`] sugar bags would cost [`[$b] y`] cents.

Since [$name] can spend a total of [`[$cC]`], or [`[$c]`] cents, we can write the equation:

    [`` [$a]x+[$b]y=[$c] ``]

A line's [`y`]-intercept looks like [`(0,y)`]. To find its [`y`] intercept, we substitute [`x`] in the equation with [`0`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$a]x+[$b]y &= [$c] \\
   [$a](0)+[$b]y &= [$c] \\
   [$b]y &= [$c] \\
   \frac{[$b]x}{[$b]} &= \frac{[$c]}{[$b]} \\
   x &= [$yIntercept]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The line's [`y`]-intercept is [`(0,[$yIntercept])`].

The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
