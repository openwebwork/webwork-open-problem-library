BEGIN_PGML


By your cell phone contract, you pay a monthly fee plus [`[$cm]`] for each minute you spend on the phone. In one month, you spent [`[$x1]`] minutes over the phone, and had a bill totaling [`[$cy1]`].

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes you spend on the phone in a month, and let [`y`] be your total cell phone bill for that month, in dollars. Use a linear equation to model your monthly bill based on the number of minutes you spend on the phone. 
a) A point-slope equation to model this is [______________]{$ansPS_evaluator}.

b) If you spend [`[$x3]`] minutes on the phone in a month, you would be billed [___________]{$cy3}.

c) If your bill was [`[$cy4]`] one month, you must have spent [___________]{$x4} minutes on the phone in that month.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in point-slope form looks like [` y=m(x-x_0)+y_0 `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`(x_0,y_0)`] is some point we know to be on the line. We first need to find the line's slope. The slope of the linear model has been given to us: [`[$cm]`] per minute. 

    So now we have that [` y=[$m](x-x_0)+y_0 `]. We can use [`(x_0,y_0)=([$x1],[$y1])`] to get [`[$ansPS]`].

b)    In one month, you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes on the phone. To find out the bill, we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m](x-[$x1])+[$y1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]([$x3]-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    If you spent [`[$x3]`] minutes over the phone in a month, your bill for that month would be [`[$cy3]`].

c)    In one month, you had a cell phone bill of [`[$cy4]`]. To find how many minutes you spent on the phone that month, we substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m](x-[$x1])+[$y1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m](x-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  [@$y4-$y1@] &= [$m](x-[$x1])\\
  \frac{[@$y4-$y1@]}{[$m]} &= x - [$x1]\\
  [@($y4-$y1)/$m@] &= x - [$x1]\\
  [@($y4-$y1)/$m+$x1@] &= x\\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    If your bill was [`[$cy4]`] in one month, you must have spent [`[$x4]`] minutes on the phone.
