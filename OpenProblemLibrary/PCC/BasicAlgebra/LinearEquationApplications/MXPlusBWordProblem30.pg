BEGIN_PGML

A school purchased a batch of T-shirts from a company. The company charged [`[$ca]`] per T-shirt, and gave the school a [`[$cb]`] rebate. If the school had a net expense of [`[$ct]`] from the purchase, how many T-shirts did the school buy?

    The school purchased [__________]{$ans} T-shirts.

$s1=$t+$b;
$s2=$t-$a;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let [`x`] be the number of T-shirts the school purchased.

Each T-shirt costs [`[$ca]`], so [`x`] T-shirts cost [`[$a]x`] dollars. After that expense, there was a rebate of [$b] dollars.

Now we can write an equation:

    [`` [$a]x-[$b] = [$t] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$a]x -[$b] &= [$t] \\
  [$a]x -[$b]\mathbf{{}+[$b]} &= [$t]\mathbf{{}+[$b]} \\
  [$a]x      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{[$a]x}{[$a]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{[$a]} \\
  x   &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
`]

The school purchased [`[$ans]`] T-shirts.
