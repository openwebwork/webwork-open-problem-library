BEGIN_PGML

In a doctor's office, the receptionist's annual salary is [`[$ca]`] less than that of the doctor. 
Together, the doctor and the receptionist make [`[$cb]`] per year. Find each person's annual income.

The receptionist's annual income is [__________]{$sec}. The doctor's annual income is [__________]{$doc}.

END_PGML

$s1 = $b-$a;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let the receptionist's annual income be [`x`] dollars. Then the doctor's annual income is [`x+[$a]`] dollars.

Since their total annual income is [`[$b]`] dollars, we can write the following equation:

    [`` x+(x+[$a])=[$b] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

     [`
\begin{aligned}
  x+x+[$a]   &{}= [$b] \\
 2x+[$a] &= [$b] \\
  2x+[$a]\mathbf{{}-[$a]} &= [$b]\mathbf{{}-[$a]} \\
  2x      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{2x}{2} &= \frac{[$s1]}{2} \\
  x       &= [$sec]
\end{aligned}
`]

We found that the receptionist earns [`[$sec]`] per year.

So the doctor's annual salary is [`[$sec]+[$ca]`], which is [`[$doc]`]
