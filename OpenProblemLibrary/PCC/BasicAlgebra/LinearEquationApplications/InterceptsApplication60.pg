BEGIN_PGML

A new car of a certain model costs [`[$yInterceptC]`]. According to Blue Book, its value decreases by [`[$slopeAbsC]`] every year.

Assume [`x`] years since its purchase, the car's value is [`y`] dollars. Use a linear equation to model the car's value.

Find this line's [`y`]-intercept, and interpret its meaning in this context.

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

ANS( $radio->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [`x`] years since its purchase, the car's value is [`y`] dollars. A linear equation to model the car's value is:

    [`` y = [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] ``]

Since this line is in its slope-intercept mode, we can see its [`y`]-intercept is [`(0,[$yIntercept])`].

The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
