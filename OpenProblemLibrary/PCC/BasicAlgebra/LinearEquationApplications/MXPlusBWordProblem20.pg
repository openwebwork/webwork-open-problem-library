TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

Your cell phone company charges a [`[$ca]`] monthly fee, plus [`[$cb]`] per minute of talk time. One month your cell phone bill
was [`[$ct]`]. How many minutes did you spend talking on the phone that month?

    You spent [__________]{$ans} talking on the phone that month.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let [`x`] be the number of minutes you talked on the phone that month.

You must pay [`[$cb]`] per minute of talk time. If you talked [`x`] minutes, you would pay [`[$b]x`] dollars.

Now we can write an equation:

    [`` [$a]+[$b]x = [$t] ``]

Next, we solve for [`x`]:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$a] +[$b]x &= [$t] \\
  [$a] +[$b]x\mathbf{{}-[$a]} &= [$t]\mathbf{{}-[$a]} \\
  [$b]x      &= [$s1] \\
  \frac{[$b]x}{[$b]} &= \frac{[$s1]}{[$b]} \\
  x   &= [$s1/$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

You spent [`[$ans]`] talking on the phone in that month.
