TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A company set aside a certain amount of money in the year 2000. The company spent exactly [`[$cm]`] from that fund each year on perks for its employees. In [` [$yx1]`], there was still [`[$cy1]`] left in the fund. 

Let [`x`] be the number of years since 2000, and let [`y`] be the amount of money, in dollars, left in the fund that year. Use a linear equation to model the amount of money left in the fund after so many years. 
a) A point-slope equation to model this is [______________]{$ansPS_evaluator}.

b) In the year [`[$yx3]`], there was [___________]{$cy3} left in the fund.

c) In the year [___________]{$yx4}, the fund will be empty.

$s5=$m*$x3;
$s6=$y4-$b;

$outputx1 = $x1<0 ? "($x1)" : $x1;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in point-slope form looks like [` y=m(x-x_0)+y_0 `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`(x_0,y_0)`] is some point we know to be on the line. We first need to find the line's slope. We have been told that the account decreases by [`[$cm]`] each year, so the slope of the linear model is [`[$m]`] (dollars per year).

    So now we have that [` y=[$m](x-x_0)+y_0 `]. We can use [`(x_0,y_0)=([$x1],[$y1])`] to get [`[$ansPS]`].

b)    In the year [`[$yx3]`], [`x`] was [`[$x3]`]. To find the amount remaining in the fund, we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m](x-[$x1])+[$y1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]([$x3]-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    So in the year [`[$yx3]`], the fund had [`[$cy3]`] remaining in it.

c)    The fund will be empty when it has [`[$cz]`] left in it. That is, [`y`] will equal [`0`]. To find how many years until this happens, we substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m](x-[$x1])+[$y1] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m](x-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) +[$y1] \\
  [@$y4-$y1@] &= [$m](x-[$x1])\\
  \frac{[@$y4-$y1@]}{[$m]} &= x - [$x1]\\
  [@($y4-$y1)/$m@] &= x - [$x1]\\
  [@($y4-$y1)/$m+$x1@] &= x\\
  [$x4] &= x
\end{aligned}
``]

    Approximately [`[$x4]`] years after 2000, in the year [$yx4], the fund will be depleted.
