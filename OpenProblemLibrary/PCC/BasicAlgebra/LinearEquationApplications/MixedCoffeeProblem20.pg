BEGIN_PGML

A store has some beans selling for [`[$price1C]`] per pound, and some vegetables selling for [`[$price2C]`] per pound. The store plans to use them to produce [`[$weight3]`] pounds of mixture and sell for [`[$price3C]`] per pound. How many pounds of beans and how many pounds of vegetables should be used?

To produce [`[$weight3]`] pounds of mixture, the store should use [______]{$weight1} pounds of beans and [______]{$weight2} pounds of vegetables.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the store will mix [`x`] pounds of beans into the mixture, so it will mix in [`[$weight3]-x`] pounds of vegetables. We will use a table to organize data.

[@DataTable(
  [
    [[PF('[``]'),
      rowcss  => 'border-bottom: 3px solid; ',],
     [PF('Price per Pound (in Dollars)'),
     ],
     [PF('Amount (in Pounds)'),
     ],
     [PF('Value (in Dollars)'),
     ],
    ],
    [[PF('Beans'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price1]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`x`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price1]x`]'),
     ],
    ],
    [[PF('Vegetables'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price2]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$weight3]-x`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price2]([$weight3]-x)`]'),
     ],
    ],
    [[PF('Mixture'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price3]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$weight3]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price3]\cdot[$weight1]=[$total3]`]'),
     ],
    ],
  ],
  align => 'l c c c',
  columnscss =>
    ['border-right: 0px solid; ',
     ' ',
     ' ',],
);@]*

According to the table, the bean's total value is [`[$price1]x`] dollars, and the vegetable's total value is [`[$price2]([$weight3]-x)`] dollars. After they are mixed, the total value will be [`[$total3])`] dollars. Now we can write and solve this equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$price1]x+[$price2]([$weight3]-x) &= [$total3] \\
   [$price1]x+[$price2*$weight3]-[$price2]x &= [$total3] \\
   [$price1-$price2]x + [$price2*$weight3] &= [$total3] \\
   [$price1-$price2]x + [$price2*$weight3] \mathbf{{}-[$price2*$weight3]} &= [$total3] \mathbf{{}-[$price2*$weight3]} \\
   [$price1-$price2]x &= [$total3-$price2*$weight3] \\
   \frac{[$price1-$price2]x}{[$price1-$price2]} &= \frac{[$total3-$price2*$weight3]}{[$price1-$price2]} \\
   x &= [$weight1]
\end{aligned}
    ``]

To produce [`[$weight3]`] pounds of mixture, the store should use [`[$weight1]`] pounds of beans and [`[$weight3]-x=[$weight3]-[$weight1]=[$weight2]`] pounds of vegetables.
