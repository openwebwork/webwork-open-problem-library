BEGIN_PGML

Town A and Town B were located close to each other, and recently merged into one city. Town A had a population with [`[$p1]%`] [$ethnicity]. Town B had a population with [`[$p2]%`] [$ethnicity]. After the merge, the new city has a total of [`[$s3]`] residents, with [`[$p3]%`] [$ethnicity]. How many residents did Town A and Town B used to have?

    Town A used to have [__________]{$s1} residents, and Town B used to have [__________]{$s2} residents.

$step1 = $dp2*$s3;
$step2 = $dp1-$dp2;
$step3 = $dp3*$s3;
$step4 = $step3 - $step1;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
If we let \(x\) represent the number of people that Town A used to have, then since the merged city has a total of \($s3 \) residents, Town B used to have \($s3 -x\) residents.
$PAR
Town A used to have \($dp1 x\) $ethnicity.
$PAR
Town B used to have \($dp2 ($s3 -x)\) $ethnicity.
$PAR
The city has \($dp3($s3)\) $ethnicity.

$PAR
We can organize the information about each town into a table:
$PAR
\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Percent of $ethnicity",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Total Number of Residents",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Number of $ethnicity",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"Town A",header=>"RH"},"\($p1%\)","$SPACE","\(x\)","$SPACE","\($dp1 x\)"],
[{data=>"Town B",header=>"RH"},"\($p2%\)","$SPACE","\($s3-x\)","$SPACE","\($dp2 ($s3-x)\)"],
[{data=>"Merged City",header=>"RH"},"\($p3%\)","$SPACE","\($s3\)","$SPACE","\($dp3 \cdot $s3\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  

$PAR

Since the two towns merged to make the new city, the number of $ethnicity in the new city should be equal to the sum of the numbers of $ethnicity from the two towns. So we can write an equation and then solve it:
$PAR
\[
\begin{aligned}
   $dp3  \cdot $s3  &= $dp1 x+$dp2 ($s3 -x) \\
   $step3  &= $dp1 x+$dp2  \cdot $s3  - $dp2  \cdot x \\
   $step3  &= $dp1 x+$step1  - $dp2  \cdot x \\
   $step3  &= $step2 x+$step1  \\
   $step3 \mathbf{{}-$step1}  &= $step2 x+$step1 \mathbf{{}-$step1}   \\
   $step4  &= $step2 x \\
   \frac{$step4 }{$step2 } &= \frac{$step2 x}{$step2 } \\
              $s1        &= x\\
              x          &= $s1
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
So Town A used to have \($s1\) residents.
$PAR
Thus, Town B must have had \($s3-$s1\), or \($s2\) residents.
$PAR
