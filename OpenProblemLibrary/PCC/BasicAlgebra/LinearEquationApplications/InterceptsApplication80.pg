BEGIN_PGML

Starting a few days ago. [$name] has been adding [`[$slopeC]`] to [$possessive] piggy bank every day. On Oct. 1, [$pronoun] had [`[$yInterceptC]`] in his piggy bank.

Assume [`x`] days after Oct. 1, [$name] has [`y`] dollars in his piggy bank. Use a linear equation to model the amount of money in the piggy bank.

Find this line's [`y`]-intercept, and interpret its meaning in this context.

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

END_PGML

ANS( $radio->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [`x`] days after Oct. 1, [$name] has [`y`] dollars in his piggy bank. We can use this linear equation to model the amount of money in the piggy bank:

    [`` y = [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] ``]

Since the line is in slope-intercept mode, we can see its [`y`]-intercept is [`(0,[$yIntercept])`].

The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
