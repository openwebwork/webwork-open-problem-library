BEGIN_PGML

You've poured some [`[$p1]%`] (by mass) alcohol solution and some [`[$p2]%`] alcohol solution into a large glass mixing container. Now you have [`[$s3]`] grams of [`[$p3]%`] alcohol solution.  How many grams of [`[$p1]%`] solution and how many grams of [`[$p2]%`] solution did you pour into the mixing container?

    You poured [__________]{$s1} grams of [`[$p1]%`] solution and [__________]{$s2} grams of [`[$p2]%`] solution into the mixing container.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
Let's let \(x\) represent the number of grams of \($p1%\) solution that was used. Then since the final product has \($s3\) grams, there must be \($s3-x\) grams of the \($p2%\) solution.
$PAR
Solution 1 has \($dp1  \cdot x = $dp1 x\) grams of alcohol.
$PAR
Solution 2 has \($p2%\) alcohol. By the percentage formula, Solution 2 has \($dp2 ($s3 -x)\) grams of alcohol.
$PAR
The mixture weighs \($s3\) grams, and has \( $p3%\) of alcohol. By the percentage formula, the mixture has \( $dp3 \cdot $s3 \) grams of pure alcohol.
$PAR
Let's organize the information above into a table:
$PAR
\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Percent of Alcohol",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Weight of Solution (in grams)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Weight of Pure Alcohol (in grams)",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"Solution 1",header=>"RH"},"\($p1%\)","$SPACE","\(x\)","$SPACE","\($dp1 x\)"],
[{data=>"Solution 2",header=>"RH"},"\($p2%\)","$SPACE","\($s3-x\)","$SPACE","\($dp2 ($s3-x)\)"],
[{data=>"Mixture",header=>"RH"},"\($p3%\)","$SPACE","\($s3\)","$SPACE","\($dp3 \cdot $s3\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  

$PAR

Since the amounts of pure alcohol in the first two solutions combine to make the amount of pure alcohol in the mixture, we have the following relationship:
\[\text{alcohol in mixture} = \text{alcohol in Solution 1} + \text{alcohol in Solution 2}\]
$PAR
We can use this relationship to write an equation and then solve it:
$PAR
\[
\begin{aligned}
   $dp3  \cdot $s3  &= $dp1 x+$dp2 ($s3 -x) \\
   $step3  &= $dp1 x+$dp2  \cdot $s3  - $dp2  \cdot x \\
   $step3  &= $dp1 x+$step1  - $dp2  \cdot x \\
   $step3  &= $step2 x+$step1  \\
   $step3 \mathbf{{}-$step1} &= $step2 x+$step1 \mathbf{{}-$step1}  \\
   $step4  &= $step2 x \\
   \frac{$step4 }{$step2 } &= \frac{$step2 x}{$step2 } \\
              $s1        &= x\\
              x  &= $s1
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
So you poured \($s1\) grams of \($p1%\) solution into the mixing container.
$PAR
Thus, you must have poured \($s3 -$s1\), or \($s2 \) grams of \($p2%\) solution into the mixing container.
