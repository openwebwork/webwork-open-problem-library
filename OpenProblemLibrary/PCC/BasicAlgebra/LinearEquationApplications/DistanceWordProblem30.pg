BEGIN_PGML

[$name1] drove a total of [`[$d]`] miles in two legs of a trip. In the first part of [$possessive] trip, [$pronoun] drove at a constant speed for [`[$t1]`] hours. In the second part of [$possessive] trip, [$pronoun] drove [`[$rDif]`] miles per hour slower, and drove for [`[$t2]`] hours. How fast was [$name1] driving in each leg of the trip?

    In the first part of the trip, [$name1] drove at a speed of [______]{$r1} miles per hour.

    In the second part of the trip, [$name1] drove at a speed of [______]{$r2} miles per hour.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

The relevant formula is:

\[\text{rate}\cdot\text{time} = \text{distance}\]

If we let \(x\) represent $name1's speed (in miles per hour) for the first leg of the trip, then we know that in the second leg, $pronoun drove with a speed of \(x-$rDif\) miles per hour. We may use a table to organize the quantities (rate, time, and distance) for each of the two legs:
$PAR

\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Rate",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Time",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Distance",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"first part of the trip",header=>"RH"},"\(x\)","$SPACE","\($t1\)","$SPACE","\($t1 x\)"],
[{data=>"second part of the trip",header=>"RH"},"\(x-$rDif\)","$SPACE","\($t2\)","$SPACE","\($t2(x-$rDif)\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  

$PAR

On the one hand the table shows us that the total distance that $name1 traveled is \($t1 x+$t2(x-$rDif)\) miles. But we also know that $name1 drove a total of  \($d\) miles. Now we can write an equation and solve it.

\[
\begin{aligned}[t]
   $t1 x + $t2 (x-$rDif ) &= $d  \\
   $t1 x + $t2 x-$t2  \cdot $rDif  &= $d  \\
   $s2 x -$s1  &= $d  \\
   $s2 x -$s1  +$s1  &= $d  +$s1  \\
   $s2 x &= $s3  \\
   \frac{$s2 x}{$s2 } &= \frac{$s3 }{$s2 } \\
   x &= $r1  \\
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR

So $name1 drove at \($r1\) miles per hour in the first part of the trip. And that means $pronoun drove with a speed of \($r1-$rDif\), or \($r2\), miles per hour in the second part of the trip.
