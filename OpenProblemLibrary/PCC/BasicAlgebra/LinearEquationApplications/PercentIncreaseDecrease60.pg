BEGIN_PGML

An Internet service provider used to have [`[$original]`] dial-up customers about 3 years ago. Now it has [`[$new]`] dial-up customers. What is the total percent decrease in the number of dial-up customers?

    The total percent decrease is [________]{$ans}.

$s1 = $new/$original;
$s2 = sprintf("%.2f", $s1*100);

$connector = '=';
if (round($ans->value)!=($ans->value)) {
   $connector = '\approx';
};

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

####Method 1  

To calculate the percentage increase/decrease, first we find the amount of increase/decrease by doing a simple subtraction calculation, 
and then we find the percentage increase/decrease.

In this problem, the amount of decrease is [`[$original]-[$new]=[$decrease]`].

Since there were initially [`[$original]`] customers, we need to ask: [`[$decrease]`] is what percent of [`[$original]`]?

Let the decrease [`[$decrease]`] be [`x`] (as a percent) of [`[$original]`]. That means:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  [$decrease]   &= x \cdot [$original] \\
  \frac{[$decrease]}{[$new]} &= \frac{x \cdot [$original]}{[$original]} \\
  [$ansP/100]       & [$connector]  x\\
  x &[$connector]  [$ansShow] % \\
\end{aligned}
    ``]

There has been a [`[$ansShow]%`] decrease in customers over this three-year period.

####Method 2  

We first divide the "new number" by the "original number":

    [`` \frac{[$new]}{[$original]} [$connector] [$s1] [$connector] [$s2]% ``]

So the new number is approximately [`[$s2]%`] of the original number, implying the percentage decrease is approximately [` 100% - [$s2]% = [$ansShow]% `].

There has been a [`[$ansShow]%`] decrease in customers over this three-year period.
