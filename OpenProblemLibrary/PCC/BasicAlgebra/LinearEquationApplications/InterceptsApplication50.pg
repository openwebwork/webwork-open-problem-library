BEGIN_PGML

A new car of a certain model costs [`[$yInterceptC]`]. According to Blue Book, its value decreases by [`[$slopeAbsC]`] every year.

Assume [`x`] years since its purchase, the car's value is [`y`] dollars. Use a linear equation to model the car's value.

Find this line's [`x`]-intercept, and interpret its meaning in this context.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume [`x`] years since its purchase, the car's value is [`y`] dollars. A linear equation to model the car's value is:

    [`` y = [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] ``]

A line's [`x`]-intercept looks like [`(x,0)`]. To find its [`x`] intercept, we substitute [`y`] in the equation with [`0`], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   y &= [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] \\
   0 &= [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] \\
   -[$yIntercept] &= [$slope]x \\
   \frac{-[$yIntercept]}{[$slope]} &= \frac{[$slope]x}{[$slope]} \\
   [$xIntercept] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

The line's [`x`]-intercept is [`([$xIntercept],0)`].

The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
