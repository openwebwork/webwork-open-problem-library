BEGIN_PGML

[$name] sells cars, and earns [`[$a] %`] commission for each car [$pronoun] sells. Last month, [$name] earned [`[$cb]`] in commisions. How much did [$pronoun] sell?

    [$name] had [___________]{$cans} in sales last month.

END_PGML

$s1 = $a/100;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Suppose that [$name]'s total sales were [`x`] dollars last month.

A [`[$a]%`] commission implies the commission was [`[$s1]x`] dollars.

Now we can set up an equation:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$s1]x &= [$b] \\
  \frac{[$s1]x}{[$s1]} &= \frac{[$b]}{[$s1]} \\
  x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    `]

[$name] had [`[$cans]`] in sales last month.
