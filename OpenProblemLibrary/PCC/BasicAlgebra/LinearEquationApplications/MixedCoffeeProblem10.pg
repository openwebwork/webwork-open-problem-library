BEGIN_PGML

A coffee shop has [`[$weight1]`] pounds of dark coffee, which sells for [`[$price1C]`] per pound. It also has some light coffee, which sells for [`[$price2C]`] per pound. The coffee shop plans to mix some light coffee into the dark coffee, and sell the mixture for [`[$price3C]`] per pound. How many pounds of light coffee should be mixed in?

To make coffee worth [`[$price3C]`], the coffee shop needs to mix [__________]{$weight2} pounds of light coffee with the dark coffee.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the coffee shop will mix [`x`] pounds of light coffee into the dark coffee. We will use a table to organize data.

[@DataTable(
  [
    [[PF('[``]'),
      rowcss  => 'border-bottom: 3px solid; ',],
     [PF('Price per Pound (in Dollars)'),
     ],
     [PF('Amount of Coffee (in Pounds)'),
     ],
     [PF('Worth of Coffee (in Dollars)'),
     ],
    ],
    [[PF('Dark Coffee'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price1]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$weight1]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$total1]`]'),
     ],
    ],
    [[PF('Light Coffee'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price2]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`x`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price2]x`]'),
     ],
    ],
    [[PF('Mixture'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price3]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`x+[$weight1]`]'),
     ],
     [PF('[`[$price3](x+[$weight1])`]'),
     ],
    ],
  ],
  align => 'l c c c',
  columnscss =>
    ['border-right: 0px solid; ',
     ' ',
     ' ',],
);@]*

According to the table, the dark coffee's total value is [`[$total1C]`], and the light coffee's total value is [`[$price2]x`] dollars. After they are mixed, the total value will be [`[$price3](x+[$weight1])`] dollars. Now we can write and solve this equation:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
   [$total1]+[$price2]x &= [$price3](x+[$weight1]) \\
   [$total1]+[$price2]x &= [$price3]x+[$price3*$weight1] \\
   [$total1]+[$price2]x \mathbf{{}-[$price2]x} &= [$price3]x+[$price3*$weight1] \mathbf{{}-[$price2]x} \\
   [$total1] &= [$price3-$price2]x+[$price3*$weight1] \\
   [$total1] \mathbf{{}-[$price3*$weight1]} &= [$price3-$price2]x+[$price3*$weight1] \mathbf{{}-[$price3*$weight1]} \\
   [$total1- $price3*$weight1] &= [$price3-$price2]x \\
   \frac{[$total1- $price3*$weight1]}{[$price3-$price2]} &= \frac{[$price3-$price2]x}{[$price3-$price2]} \\
   [$weight2] &= x
\end{aligned}
    ``]

To make coffee worth [`[$price3C]`], the coffee shop needs to mix [`[$weight2]`] pounds of light coffee with the dark coffee.
