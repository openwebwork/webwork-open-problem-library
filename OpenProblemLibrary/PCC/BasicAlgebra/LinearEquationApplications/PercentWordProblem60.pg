BEGIN_PGML

Last year, [$name]'s retirement account lost [`[$p]%`] in value. 
Right now [$pronoun] has [`[$ca]`] dollars in [$modify] account. 
How much money did [$name] have before the loss?
    
    Last year the balance was [____________]{$cans}.

END_PGML

$s1 = $p/100;
$s2 = 1-$s1;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Suppose [$name] had [`x`] dollars in [$modify] account before the loss. 

A [`[$p]%`] loss implies the account's value decreased by [`[$s1]x`] dollars. This implies that after the loss the account had [`x-[$s1]x=[$s2]x`] dollars.

Now we can set up an equation:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$s2]x &= [$a] \\
  \frac{[$s2]x}{[$s2]} &= \frac{[$a]}{[$s2]} \\
  x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    `]

[$name] had [`[$cans]`] in [$modify] retirement account before the loss.
