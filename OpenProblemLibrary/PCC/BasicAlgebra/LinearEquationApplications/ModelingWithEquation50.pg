BEGIN_PGML

In May 2016, the median rent price for a one-bedroom apartment in a city was reported to be [`[$newC]`] per month. This was reported to be an increase of [`[$pNum]%`] over the previous month. Based on this reporting, what was the median price of a one-bedroom apartment in April 2016?

Assume the median price of a one-bedroom apartment in April 2016 was [`p`] dollars. Write an equation to model this scenario. There is no need to solve it.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the median price of a one-bedroom apartment in April 2016 was [`p`] dollars. A [`[$pNum]%`] increase is [`[$p]p`] dollars. Since April's price plus the increase is May's price, we can write the equation:

    [``p+[$p]p=[$new]``]
