TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A company set aside a certain amount of money in the year 2000. The company spent exactly [`[$cm]`] from that fund each year on perks for its employees. In [` [$yx1]`], there was still [`[$cy1]`] left in the fund. 

Let [`x`] be the number of years since 2000, and let [`y`] be the amount of money, in dollars, left in the fund that year. Use a linear equation to model the amount of money left in the fund after so many years. 
a) The linear model's slope-intercept equation is [______________]{$ansSI}.

b) In the year [`[$yx3]`], there was [___________]{$cy3} left in the fund.

c) In the year [___________]{$yx4}, the fund will be empty.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a)    A line's equation in slope-intercept form looks like [` y=mx+b `], where [`m`] is the slope, and [`y`] is the [`y`]-coordinate of the [`y`]-intercept. We have been told that the account decreases by [`[$cm]`] each year, so the slope of the linear model is [`[$m]`] (dollars per year).

    So now we have that [` y=[$m]x+b `]. The next step is to find the value of [`b`]. There are at least two ways.

    ####One way####
    is to substitute a point into [` y=[$mx]+b `].  We use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$mx] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$m] \cdot [$x1] + b \\
  [$y1] &= [$s3] + b \\
  [$y1]\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} &= [$s3] + b\mathbf{{}-[$s3]} \\
  [$b] &= b\\
  b &= [$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$mx]+[$b] `].

    ####Another way####
    is to use the line's point-slope equation [` y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1}) `]. Again, use the point [`([$x1],[$y1])`].

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  y-y_{1} &= m(x-x_{1}) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$m](x-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$mx]+[$m] \cdot (-[$x1]) \\
  y-[$y1] &= [$mx]+[$s4] \\
  y-[$y1]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} &= [$mx]+[$s4]\mathbf{{}+[$y1]} \\
  y       &= [$mx]+[$b]
\end{aligned}
`]

    This is the second way to find [`b`], and thus the line's slope-intercept equation is [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `].
    ----
b)    In the year [`[$yx3]`], [`x`] was [`[$x3]`]. To find the amount remaining in the fund, we substitute [`[$x3]`] in for [`x`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  y &= [$m] \cdot [$x3] +[$b] \\
  y &= [$s5]+[$b] \\
  y &= [$y3]
\end{aligned}
``]

    So in the year [`[$yx3]`], the fund had [`[$cy3]`] remaining in it.
    ----
c)    The fund will be empty when it has [`[$cz]`] left in it. That is, [`y`] will equal [`0`]. To find how many years until this happens, we substitute [`[$y4]`] in for [`y`] in the equation [` y=[$m]x+[$b] `], and we have:

    [``
\begin{aligned}
  y &= [$m]x+[$b] \\
  [$y4] &= [$m]x +[$b] \\
  [$y4]\mathbf{{}-[$b]} &= [$m]x +[$b]\mathbf{{}-[$b]} \\
  [$s6] &= [$m]x \\
  \frac{[$s6]}{[$m]} &= \frac{[$m]x}{[$m]} \\
  [$out1]
\end{aligned}
``]

    Approximately [`[$x4]`] years after 2000, in the year [$yx4], the fund will be depleted.
