BEGIN_PGML

After a [`[$p]%`] increase, a town has [`[$a]`] people. What was the population before the increase?

    Before the increase, the town's population was [_______]{$ans}.

END_PGML

$s1 = $p/100;
$s2 = 1+$s1;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let the town's original population be [`x`]. 

A [`[$p]%`] increase implies the town's population increased by [`[$s1]x`] people. This implies, after the increase, the town's population became [`x+[$s1]x`], which is [`[$s2]x`].

Now we can set up an equation:

    [`
\begin{aligned}
  [$s2]x &= [$a] \\
  \frac{[$s2]x}{[$s2]} &= \frac{[$a]}{[$s2]} \\
  x &= [$ans]
\end{aligned}
    `]

The town's population was [`[$ans]`] before the increase.
