BEGIN_PGML

An engine's tank can hold [`[$yIntercept]`] gallons of gasoline. It was refilled with a full tank, and has been running without breaks, consuming [`[$slopeAbs]`] gallons of gas per hour.

Assume the engine has been running for [`x`] hours since its tank was refilled, and assume there are [`y`] gallons of gas left in the tank. Use a linear equation to model the amount of gas in the tank as time passes.

Find this line's [`y`]-intercept, and interpret its meaning in this context.

    [@$radio->buttons()@]*

ANS( $radio->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Assume the engine has been running for [`x`] hours since its tank was refilled, and assume there are [`y`] gallons of gas left in the tank. A linear equation to model the amount of gas in the tank is:

    [`` y = [$slope]x+[$yIntercept] ``]

Since the equation is in slope-intercept mode, we can see its [`y`]-intercept is [`(0,[$yIntercept])`].

The correct solution is: [$correctAns]
