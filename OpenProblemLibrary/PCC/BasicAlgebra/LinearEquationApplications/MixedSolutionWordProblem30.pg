BEGIN_PGML

You've poured [`[$s1]`] grams of a [`[$p1]%`] (by mass) alcohol solution into a large glass container. You have plenty of [`100%`] pure alcohol on hand. You need to make some [`[$p3]%`] alcohol solution. How many grams of pure alcohol do you have to add to the glass container to end up with a [`[$p3]%`] alcohol solution?

    You need to add [__________]{$s2} grams of pure alcohol to end up with a [`[$p3]%`] alcohol solution.

$step1 = $dp3*$s1;
$step2 = $dp3-$dp2;
$step3 = $pure1-$step1;

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
Let's let \(x\) represent the number of grams of pure alcohol that needs to be added.
$PAR
The first solution has \($dp1  \cdot $s1  \) grams of pure alcohol.
$PAR
Since you will be adding pure alcohol, you will be adding \(x\) grams of pure alcohol.
$PAR
The mixture will be a \($p3%\) solution and have a total mass of \($s1 + x\) grams. So it will have \($dp3($s1+x)\) grams of pure alcohol.
$PAR

This table helps to organize the information:
$PAR
\{ 
DataTable([[{data=>"",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Percent of Alcohol",header=>"CH"},{data=>" \(\times\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Weight of Solution (in grams)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"\(=\)",header=>"CH"},{data=>"Weight of Pure Alcohol (in grams)",header=>"CH"},],
[{data=>"Solution 1",header=>"RH"},"\($p1%\)","$SPACE","\($s1\)","$SPACE","\($dp1 \cdot $s1=$pure1\)"],
[{data=>"Solution 2",header=>"RH"},"\($p2%\)","$SPACE","\(x\)","$SPACE","\($dp2 x=x\)"],
[{data=>"Mixture",header=>"RH"},"\($p3%\)","$SPACE","\($s1+x\)","$SPACE","\($dp3 ($s1+x)\)"],
], allcellcss=>"border:1px solid;padding:4pt;text-align:center;", caption => "Organize data with a table", captioncss =>"padding:4pt; text-decoration:none;");
\}  

$PAR

Since the amounts of pure alcohol in the first two solutions combine to make the amount of pure alcohol in the mixture, we have the following relationship:
\[\text{alcohol in mixture} = \text{alcohol in Solution 1} + \text{alcohol in Solution 2}\]
$PAR
We can use this relationship to write an equation and then solve it:
$PAR
\[
\begin{aligned}
   $dp3  \cdot ($s1 +x) &= $pure1 +x \\
   $dp3  \cdot $s1  + $dp3 x &= $pure1 +x \\
   $step1  + $dp3 x &= $pure1 +x \\
   $step1  + $dp3 x -x &= $pure1 +x -x \\
   $step1  + $step2 x &= $pure1  \\
   $step1  + $step2 x \mathbf{{}-$step1}  &= $pure1  \mathbf{{}-$step1} \\
            $step2 x &= $step3  \\
   \frac{$step2 x}{$step2 } &= \frac{$step3 }{$step2 } \\
              x       &= $s2 
\end{aligned}
\]
$PAR
So you need to pour \($s2\) grams of pure alcohol into the mixing container.
