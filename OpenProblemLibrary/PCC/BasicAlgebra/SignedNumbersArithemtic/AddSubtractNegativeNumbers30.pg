Consider the following scenario in which you study your bank account.

* On Jan. 1, you had a balance of [`-[$a]`] dollars in your bank account.

* On Jan. 2, your bank charged [`[$b]`] dollar overdraft fee.

* On Jan. 3, you deposited [`[$c]`] dollars.

* On Jan. 10, you withdrew [`[$d]`] dollars.

What is your balance on Jan. 11?

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Withdrawing money and being charge a fee is like adding a negative number to your bank balance. Depositing money is like adding a positive number to your bank balance. To model this situation, we do the following calculation:

    [`
      \begin{aligned}
          -[$a]+(-[$b])+[$c]+(-[$d])&  = [$step1]+[$c]+(-[$d]) \\
                                    &= [$step2] +(-[$d]) \\
                                    & = [$ans] 
       \end{aligned}
           `]

Your balance is [`[$CurrencyAns]`] on Jan. 11.
