BEGIN_PGML

Consider the following situation in which you borrow money from your cousin:

* On June 1st, you borrowed [`[$a]`] dollars from your cousin.

* On July 1st, you borrowed [`[$b]`] more dollars from your cousin.

* On August 1st, you paid back [`[$c]`] dollars to your cousin.

* On September 1st, you borrowed another [`[$d]`] dollars from your cousin.

How much money do you owe your cousin now?

$wrong = -1*$CurrencyAns;
ANS($CurrencyAns -> cmp() ->
  withPostFilter(AnswerHints(
    "$wrong" =>
    "Remember that your answer should be *positive* because the question asks how much you owe.",
    	sub {
          my ($correct,$student,$ans) = @_;
          return ($student->class eq 'Real');} => ["Since the answer is a dollar amount, you should answer with a dollar symbol",checkTypes => 0, replaceMessage => 1],)));


BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Borrowing money is like adding a negative number. Paying money back is like adding a positive number. To model this situation, we do the following calculation:

    [`
       \begin{aligned}
         -[$a]+(-[$b])+[$c]+(-[$d]) & = [$step1]+[$c]+(-[$d]) \\
                                    & = [$step2] +(-[$d]) \\
                                    & = -[$ans] 
         \end{aligned}
    `]

Now you owe your cousin [`[$CurrencyAns]`].
