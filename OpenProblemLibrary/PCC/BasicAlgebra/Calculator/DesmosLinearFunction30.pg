TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A new mine has [`[$b]`] tons of coals in reserve. Every year, it plans to sell [`[$mN]`] tons.

Use graphing technology to define a function to model the amount of coals, and locate the points to answer the following questions:

1. After [`[$x1]`] years, there will be [__________]{$y1} tons of coals left.

2. After [__________]{$x2} years, there will be [`[$y2]`] tons of coals left.

3. At this rate, coals in the mine will be used up in [___________]{$xInt} years.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since the mine has [`[$b]`] tons of coals in reserve, and it will sell [`[$mN]`] tons per year, we can model the amount of coals, in tons, by the function

    [`` f(x)=[$func] ``]

where [`x`] is the number of years.

Next, we will use desmos.com to answer those questions.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `].

###Question 1

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$x1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$y1]`]. This implies: After [`[$x1]`] years, there will be [`[$y1]`] tons of coals left.

###Question 2

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$y2]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2]`]. Desmos shows [`([$x2],[$y2])`]. This implies: After [`[$x2]`] years, there will be [`[$y2]`] tons of coals left.

###Question 3

Step 3: Zoom out on the window until you can see the line's [`x`]-intercept. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 4: Click on the [`x`]-intercept, and desmos shows [`([$xInt],0)`]. This implies: At this rate, coals in the mine will be used up in [`[$xInt]`] years.
