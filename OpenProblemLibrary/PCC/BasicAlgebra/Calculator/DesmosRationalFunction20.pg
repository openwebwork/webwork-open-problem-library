TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A drug's concentration in a patient's blood, in micrograms per milliliter, can be modeled by the function

    [`` C(t) = [$funcShow] ``]

where [`t`] is the time, in minutes, since the drug is injected.

Use graphing technology to solve the following problems.

1) The drug's concentration will be [___________]{$ans1} micrograms per milliliter [`[$t1]`] minutes since the injection. Round your answers to two decimal places if needed.

2) When the drug's concentration decreases to [`[$ans2Show]`] micrograms per milliliter, it's time to give the patient another injection. The nurse should wait for [___________]{$t2} minutes before another injection. Round your answers to an integer if needed.

3) If no re-injection is applied, in the long term, the drug's concentration will be [____________]{$ans3} micrograms per milliliter.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `]. Note that we should change [`C(t)`] to [`f(x)`] and change [`t`] to [`x`] when we use desmos.com.

###Question 1

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$t1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$t1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$ans1]`].

The drug's concentration will be approximately [`[$ans1Show]`] micrograms per milliliter [`[$t1]`] minutes since the injection.

###Question 2

We need to create a second function [`y=[$ans2Show]`], and then let desmos find the intersection between those two functions.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$ans2Show]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$ans2Show]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$ans2Show]`]. Desmos shows [`([$t2],[$ans2Show])`]. (The value [`[$t2]`] was rounded.)

The nurse should wait for [`[$t2]`] minutes before another injection.

###Part 3: 

To find what value the function is approaching as [`x`] becomes bigger and bigger, we can substitute the [`x`] value with a very big number.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f(1000000) `]. Desmos shows a value very close to [`[$ans3]`]. Actually, the bigger the [`x`] value, the closer the function's value is to [`[$ans3]`].

If no re-injection is applied, in the long term, the drug's concentration will be [`[$ans3]`] micrograms per milliliter.
