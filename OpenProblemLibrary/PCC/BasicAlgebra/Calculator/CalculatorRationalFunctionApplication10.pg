TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A company manufactures and sells handbags. It costs [`[$rateU]`] to produce one handbag. The company's monthly operation cost is approximately [`[$constantU]`]. The average cost, in dollars, of one handbag can be modeled by this function:

    [`` \overline{C}(x) = [$func] ``]

where [`x`] is the number of handbags manufactured. 

Use a TI-89 or Casio ClassPad 330 graphing calculator to solve the following problems. Round your answers to whole numbers if needed.

1) If the company manufactured [`[$x1]`] handbags in a certain month, what was the average cost of one handbag in that month? [___________]{$ans1U}

2) If the average cost of one handbag was [`[$y2U]`] in a certain month, how many handbags did the company manufacture in that month? [___________]{$ans2}

3) What value is the average cost approaching as the company manufactures more and more handbags each month? [____________]{$ans3U}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

###Part 1: 

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$x1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

####TI-89 Instructions

1. Press Diamond, and then F1. Clear all functions if needed.

2. Enter the function [`([$rate]x+[$constant])/x`] for Y1. Press ENTER.

3. Press Home.

4. Enter [`y1([$x1])`]. Press Enter. You will get the value [`[$ans1]`]. 

####Casio ClassPad 330 Instructions

1. Tap "Menu".

2. Tap "Graph and Table". Enter the function [` ([$rate]x+[$constant])/x `] for y1. Press EXE.

3. Tap "Menu", and then "Main".

4. Enter [`y1([$x1])`]. Press Enter. You will get the value [`[$ans1]`]. Note that you may not use the [`y`] button on the calculator. You have to press Keyboard, go to "abc" tab, and use the [`y`] button on the screen.

###Solution to Part 1: 

If the company manufactured [`[$x1]`] handbags in a certain month, the average cost of one handbag in that month would be [`[$ans1U]`].

###Part 2: 

We need to create a second function Y2[`=[$y2Show]`], and then let the calculator find the intersection between these two functions.

####TI-89 Instructions

1. Press Diamond, and then F1. The function Y1 should still be there.

2. Enter the function [`[$y2Show]`] for Y2. Press ENTER.

3. Since numbers for this problem are very big, we must adjust the window settings. Press Diamond, and then F2. Set Xmin=0, Xmax=3000, (This is a guess, and needs to be adjusted higher if we cannot see the intersection.) Ymin=0, Ymax=[`[$upper]`]. (This value needs to be bigger than [`[$y2Show]`].) Don't change the other values.

4. Press Diamond, and then F3. If we cannot see these two functions' intersections, press Diamond, F2, change Xmax's value to something bigger, until you can see the intersection between Y1 and Y2.

5. On the screen, locate one intersection. Press F5, choose Option 5 (Intersection).

6. The calculator will ask us which curve is the first function. One of these two functions is highlighted by default. We can use the up/down arrows to change the highlighted function. Since there are only two functions in this case, we can simply press Enter.

7. The calculator will then ask us which curve is the second function. The other functions is highlighted by default. Press Enter.

8. The calculator will first ask for a "lower bound". Use the left/right arrow keys to move the cursor to anywhere to the *left* of the intersection. Press ENTER. (Pressing 2nd button and then the left/right arrow keys will speed up the cursor movement.)

9. Now the calculator will ask for an "upper bound". Move the cursor to anywhere to the *right* of the intersection. Press ENTER.

10. The calculator will display the intersection, whose [`x`] value is the solution for Part 2.

####Casio ClassPad 330 Instructions

1. Tap "Menu".

2. Tap "Graph and Table", y1's value should still be there. 

3. Enter [`[$y2Show]`] for y2. Press EXE.

4. Since numbers for this problem are very big, we must adjust the window settings. Tap the View Window tile (with 4 arrows in 4 directions). Set xmin=0, xmax=3000, (This is a guess, and needs to be adjusted higher if we cannot see the intersection.) ymin=0, ymax=[`[$upper]`]. (This value needs to be bigger than [`[$y2Show]`].) Don't change the other values. Tap OK.

5. Tap the graph tile (first from the left). If we cannot see these two functions' intersection, tap View Window tile (with 4 arrows in 4 directions), and make xmax's value bigger.

6. Once we can see the intersection, tap Analysis, G-Solve, Intersect. 

7. The calculator will display the intersection, whose [`x`] value is the solution for Part 2.

###Solution of Part 2: 

If the average cost of one handbag was [`[$y2U]`] in a certain month, the company manufactured [`[$ans2]`] in that month.

###Part 3: 

To find what value the function is approaching as [`x`] becomes bigger and bigger, we can substitute the [`x`] value with a very big number.

####TI-89 Instructions

1. Press Home.

2. Enter [`y1(1000000)`]. Press Enter. You will get the function's value when [`x`] is very big.

####Casio ClassPad 330 Instructions

1. Tap "Menu", and then "Main".

2. Enter [`y1(1000000)`]. Press Enter. You will get the function's value when [`x`] is very big. Note that you have to press Keyboard, go to "abc" tab, and use the [`y`] button on the screen.

###Solution to Part 3: 

As the company manufactures more and more handbags each month, the average cost of one handbag is approaching [`[$ans3U]`].
