A once thriving company had its monthly profits, _in thousands of 
dollars_, modeled by the equation

    [``f(t) = [$f]``] 

where [` t `] is in months since January 2000.

Answer the following questions with Desmos.

a) In January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [___________]{$y1C}.

a) [`[$x2]`] months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [___________]{$y2C}. (Round to *thousands of dollars*.)

a) Approximately [___________]{$x3} months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y3C]`]. (Round to a *whole number*.)

d) In the long run, the company's monthly profit would stabilize at approximately [___________]{$y4C}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$fx] `]. Note that we should change [`f(t)`] to [`f(x)`] and change [`t`] to [`x`] when we use desmos.com.

a) In January 2000, we have [`t=0`]. So we evaluate [`f(0)`].

    We need to substitute the function's [`x`]-value with [`0`] to get the corresponding [`y`]-value.

    Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f(0) `]. Desmos shows [`[$y1]`].
    
    In January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y1C]`].

a) "[`[$x2]`] months since January 2000" implies [`t=[$x2]`]. We need to substitute [`x=[$x2]`] into [`f(x)`].

    Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$x2]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$y2Raw]`].
    
    [`[$x2]`] months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y2C]`].

a) To find when the company's monthly profit was [`[$y3C]`], we need to substitute [`[$y3]`] into the function's [`y`]-value and find the corresponding [`x`]-value.

    Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$y3]`].

    Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y3]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

    Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y3]`]. Desmos shows [`([$x3Raw],[$y3])`].
    
    Approximately [`[$x3]`] months since January 2000, the company's monthly profit was approximately [`[$y3C]`].

a) "In the long run" suggests we examine the long term behavior of [`f`], as [`x`] becomes large. We need to substitute [`x`] with a very large value.
    
    Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f(1000000) `]. Desmos shows a value very close to [`[$y4]`]. Actually, the bigger the [`x`] value, the closer the function's value is to [`[$y4]`].

    In fact, the function's horizontal asymptote is at [`y=[$y4]`]. In the graph of [`f(x)`], as [`x`] moves farther to the right, [`f(x)`] gets closer to [`[$y4]`].

    In the long run, the company's monthly profit would stabilize at approximately [`[$y4C]`].
