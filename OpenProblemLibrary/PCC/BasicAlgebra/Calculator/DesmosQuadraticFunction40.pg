BEGIN_PGML

Use graphing technology to answer the following questions. Round to two decimal places when needed.

From a clifftop over the ocean [`[$cU]`] above sea level, an object was shot straight up into the air with an initial vertical speed of [`[$bU]`]. On its way down it missed the cliff and fell into the ocean. Its height (above sea level) as time passes can be modeled by the quadratic function [`f`], where [`f(t)=[$func]`]. Here [`t`] represents the number of seconds since the object's release, and [`f(t)`] represents the object's height (above sea level) in meters.

    1) After [____________]{$tMaxU}, this object reached its maximum height of [___________]{$hMaxU}.

    2) This object flew for [____________]{$tBackU} before it landed in the ocean.

    3) This object was [____________]{$h1U} above sea level [`[$t1U]`] after its release.

    4) This object was [`[$h2U]`] above sea level twice: once [____________]{$t2U} after its release, and again later [____________]{$t3U} after its release.

(Use *m* for meters, and *s* for seconds.)

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `].

###Question 1

We need to find the function's maximum value (the upside-down parabola's vertex).

Step 3: Zoom out on the window until you can see the parabola's vertex. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis. Only use the following recommended settings if you are stuck: xmin=[`[$left]`], xmax=[`[$right]`], ymin=[`[$bottom]`], ymax=[`[$top]`].

Step 4: Click on the vertex, and desmos shows [`[$vertex]`]. This implies: After [`[$tMaxU]`], this object reached its maximum height of [`[$hMaxU]`].

###Question 2

We need to find the x-intercept on the right side. (The left side x-intercept is a negative number, which makes no sense in this situation.)

Step 3: Zoom out on the window until you can see the parabola's [`x`]-intercept on the right side. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 4: Click on the [`x`]-intercept on the right side, and desmos shows [`[$xIntercept2]`]. This implies: The object flew for [`[$tBackUShow]`] before it landed in the ocean.

###Question 3

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$t1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$t1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$h1]`]. This implies: The object was [`[$h1U]`] above sea level [`[$t1U]`] after its release.

###Question 4

We need to create a second function [`y=[$h2]`], and then let desmos find the intersection between those two functions.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$h2]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$h2]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 5: Click on the intersections of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$h2]`]. Desmos shows [`[$leftIntersect]`] and [`[$rightIntersect]`]. This implies: The object was [`[$h2U]`] above sea level twice: once [`[$t2U]`] after its release, and again later [`[$t3U]`] after its release.
