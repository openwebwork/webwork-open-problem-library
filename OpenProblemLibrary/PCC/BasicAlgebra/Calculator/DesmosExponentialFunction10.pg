TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

[$name] purchased [`[$initialC]`] of bonds, which pay an annual interest of [`[$interestP]%`]. The value of the bonds, in dollars, can be modeled by the exponential function

    [`` v(t)=[$func] ``]
    
where [`t`] is the number of years passed since the purchase.

Use graphing technology to solve the following problems.

1) The bonds would be worth [___________]{$y1C} after [`[$x1]`] years. Round your answers to two decimal places (to the cent).

2) The bonds would be worth [`[$y2C]`] after [___________]{$x2R} years. Round your answers to one decimal place (the tenth digit).

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$funcX] `]. Note that you should replace the variable [`t`] with [`x`].

###Question 1

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$x1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$x1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$y1Show]`].

The bonds would be worth [`[$y1C]`] after [`[$x1]`] years.

###Question 2

We need to create a second function [`y=[$y2]`], and then let desmos find the intersection between those two functions.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$y2]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2]`]. Desmos shows [`([$x2Show],[$y2])`].

The bonds would be worth [`[$y2C]`] after [`[$x2R]`] years.
