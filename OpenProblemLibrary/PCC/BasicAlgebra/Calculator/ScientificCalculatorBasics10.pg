TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

The purpose of this problem is to differentiate between the negative symbol and the subtraction symbol.

Use a scientific calculator to evaluate this expression:

    [`` -[$a]-[$b] ``] = [__________]{$ans}

END_PGML

$wrong = $a*$b;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

On your scientific calculator, there is a button for the subtraction symbol, and another button for the negative symbol. They are different!

For this problem, we should first use the negative symbol to input [`-[$a]`], and then use the subtraction symbol for [`-[$b]`]: 

    [``^{-}[$a]-[$b]``]

and we would get the correct answer, [`[$ans]`].

If you use the subtraction symbol for [`-[$a]`], most likely, the calculator will assume you will subtract something from the last answer, and either "ans" or "ans(1)" would automatically pop up in the input line, even though you don't need it.

Now, use the negative symbol for both symbols: [` ^{-}[$a]^{-}[$b] `]. The calculator would interpret this expression as [`(-[$a])\cdot(-[$b]) `], and we would get [`[$wrong]`].
