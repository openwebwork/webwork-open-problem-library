TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

The average cost of flying a customer in an airplane trip between two cities can be modeled by the function

    [`` C(x)=[$func] ``]
    
where [`x`] stands for the airplane's speed in miles per hours, and [`C(x)`] represents the cost in dollars.

Use graphing technology to answer the following question. Round to two decimal places if needed.

    To obtain a minimum cost per passenger of [_____________]{$costU}, the airplane should fly at [___________]{$speedU}.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `]. Note that we replaced [`S(x)`] with [`f(x)`].

Next, we need to find [`f(x)`]'s minimum value. We will only look at positive values of [`f(x)`], as negative surface area doesn't have real life meaning.

Step 3: Zoom out on the window until you can see the function's minimum value in the first quadrant. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis. Only use the following recommended settings if you are stuck: xmin=[`[$left]`], xmax=[`[$right]`], ymin=[`[$bottom]`], ymax=[`[$top]`].

Step 4: Click on the minimum value, and desmos shows [`([$speedShow],[$costShow])`]. This implies: To obtain a minimum cost per passenger of [`[$costU]`], the airplane should fly at [`[$speedU]`].
