TEXT(beginproblem());

BEGIN_PGML

A company manufactures and sells handbags. It costs [`[$rateU]`] to produce one handbag. The company's monthly operation cost is approximately [`[$constantU]`]. The average cost, in dollars, of one handbag can be modeled by this function:

    [`` \overline{C}(x) = [$func] ``]

where [`x`] is the number of handbags manufactured. 

Use graphing technology to solve the following problems. Round your answers to whole numbers if needed.

1) If the company manufactured [`[$x1]`] handbags in a certain month, what was the average cost of one handbag in that month? [___________]{$ans1U}

2) If the average cost of one handbag was [`[$y2U]`] in a certain month, how many handbags did the company manufacture in that month? [___________]{$ans2}

3) What value is the average cost approaching as the company manufactures more and more handbags each month? [____________]{$ans3U}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We will use desmos.com to answer the question.

Step 1: Go to desmos.com, click on Start Graphing.

Step 2: In the first textbox, enter [` f(x)=[$func] `].

###Question 1

We need to substitute the function's [`x`] value with [`[$x1]`] to get the corresponding [`y`] value.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f([$x1]) `]. Desmos shows [`[$ans1]`].

If the company manufactured [`[$x1]`] handbags in a certain month, the average cost of one handbag in that month would be [`[$ans1U]`].

###Question 2

We need to create a second function [`y=[$y2Show]`], and then let desmos find the intersection between those two functions.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [`y=[$y2Show]`].

Step 4: Zoom out on the window, if needed, until you can see the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2Show]`]. Alternatively, click on the Graph Settings icon (looking like a tool) and define the ranges of [`x`]-axis and [`y`]-axis.

Step 5: Click on the intersection of [`f(x)`] and [`y=[$y2Show]`]. Desmos shows [`([$ans2],[$y2Show])`]. (The value [`[$ans2]`] was rounded.)

If the average cost of one handbag was [`[$y2U]`] in a certain month, the company manufactured [`[$ans2]`] in that month.

###Part 3: 

To find what value the function is approaching as [`x`] becomes bigger and bigger, we can substitute the [`x`] value with a very big number.

Step 3: In the second textbox, enter [` f(1000000) `]. Desmos shows a value very close to [`[$ans3]`]. Actually, the bigger the [`x`] value, the closer the function's value is to [`[$ans3]`].

As the company manufactures more and more handbags each month, the average cost of one handbag is approaching [`[$ans3U]`].
