# Template:
# Solve the following quadratic equation
#
#       ac x^2 + bd = - (ad + bc) x 
#
# i.e 
#
#       ac x^2 + (ad + bc) x + bd  = 0
# 
# This equation factors nicely
#
#       (ax + b)(cx + d) = 0
#
# If you need to use the square root symbol, 
# as in x=sqrt{17}, type it like: *sqrt(17)*
#
# a = c = 1, 
#
# b and d are both positive.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
There are a few ways to solve quadratic equations- the easiest way to solve this particular 
type of problem is to use the _zero product principle_. 

    [`
        \begin{aligned}
                [$lhs] = [$rhs] &\Rightarrow [$complete]=0\\
                                &\Rightarrow [$step]=0\\
                                &\Rightarrow [$var]=[$soln1]\text{ or } [$var]=[$soln2]\\
        \end{aligned}
    `]

Note that _all_ quadratic equations have *two* (possibly repeated) solutions; in this problem both solutions are real. Each solution can be checked by substituting it into the original equation- this is left as an exercise.

You might have solved the equation using the Quadratic Formula- the final 
result is the same.
