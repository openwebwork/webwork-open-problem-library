BEGIN_TEXT

As you know, when a course ends, students start to forget the material
they have learned.  One model (called the Ebbinghaus model) assumes
that the rate at which a student forgets material is proportional to
the difference between the material currently remembered and some
positive constant, \( a \).
$PAR
${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
Let \( y=f(t) \) be the fraction of the original material remembered
\( t \) weeks after the course has ended.  Set up a differential
equation for \( y\), using \(k\) as any constant of proportionality
you may need (let \(k>0\)).  Your equation will contain two constants;
the constant \( a \) (also positive) is less than \( y \) for all 
\( t \). 
$BR
\(\frac{dy}{dt} = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
What is the initial condition for your equation?
$BR
\( y(0) = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
Solve the differential equation.
$BR
\( y = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
What are the practical meaning (in terms of the amount remembered)
of the constants in the solution \( y=f(t)\)?  If after one week the
student remembers $y1p percent of the material learned in the semester,
and after two weeks remembers $y2p percent, how much will she or he
remember after summer vacation (about 14 weeks)?
$BR
percent = \{ ans_rule(35) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Our differential equation is 
\[ 
  \frac{dy}{dt} = -k(y-a),
\]
where \(k >0\) and \(a\) are constants.
We can solve this using separation of variables, getting 
\( \int \frac{dy}{y-a} = \int -k\,dt\), so 
\(\ln |y-a| = \ln(y-a) = -kt+C\). Thus,
\(y-a=Ae^{-kt}\) where \(A=e^C\).  

Initially nothing has been forgotten, so \(y(0)=1\). 
Therefore,  \( 1-a = Ae^0 = A\), so 
\(y - a = (1 - a) e^{-kt}\), or
\(y = ( 1 - a ) e^{-kt} + a\).

As \(t \to \infty\),  \(e^{-kt} \to 0\), so \(y\to a\).
Thus, \(a\) represents the fraction of material which is remembered in
the long run.  The constant \(k\) tells us about the rate at which
material is forgotten.

$PAR
Then, after one week we have 
\[ $y1 = (1 - a) e^{-k} + a, \]
and after two,
\[ $y2 = (1 - a) e^{-2k} + a. \]
Solving the first of these for \(e^{-k}\), we get
\[ e^{-k} = \frac{$y1 - a}{1 - a}, \]
so that, plugging this in to the second,
\[ $y2 = (1 - a)\left(\frac{$y1 - a}{1 - a}\right)^2 + a, \]
or
\[ $y2 - a = \frac{($y1 - a)^2}{1-a}. \]
Cross-multiplying and expanding, we get
\[ a^2 - $y2p1 a + $y2 = a^2 - $twoy1 a + $y1sq, \]
so that 
\[ a $as $aval. \]

$PAR
Plugging this back into the expression for \(e^{-k}\) and taking the
natural log of both sides, we get \(k $ks $kval\).  Thus after the
summer we have
\[ y(14) = (1 - $aval) e^{-14 ($kval)} + $aval \approx $ysum, \]
or about $yperc percent of the material remembered.
