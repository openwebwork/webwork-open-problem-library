Dead leaves accumulate on the ground in a forest at a rate of $acc
grams per square centimeter per year. At the same time, these leaves
decompose at a continuous rate of $dec percent per year.

Write a differential equation for the total quantity \(Q\) of dead 
leaves (per square centimeter) at time \(t\):

Sketch a solution to your differential equation showing that the

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let \(Q(t)\) be the quantity of dead leaves, in grams per square
centimeter.  Then \(\frac{dQ}{dt} = $acc - $rdec Q\), where \(t\) is
in years. 
$PAR
If we suppose that the initial quantity is \(Q(0) = 0\), then we can
guess what the solution will look like without solving the
differential equation: initially \(\frac{dQ}{dt} = $acc\), so the
quantity is increasing.  However, as it increases the rate of decay
\(-$rdec Q\) increases, so \(Q\) will increase until the decay rate is
equal to the accumulation rate.  This occurs when \($acc = $rdec Q\),
or \(Q $sgn $qeq\).
$PAR
Note that \(Q $sgn $qeq\) is the equilibrium solution, which is where
\(Q\) is constant: when \(Q\) is constant, \(\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0\),
which gives the same condition as we solved above.
$PAR
Therefore we know that the solution will look like the figure below,
which shows the solution in blue and the equilibrium in red.

$PAR
We can also solve the differential equation using separation of
variables.  
\[ \frac{dQ}{dt} = $acc - $rdec Q, \]
so 
\[ \int\frac{dQ}{$acc - $rdec Q} = \int\,dt, \]
and
\[ -\frac{1}{$rdec} \ln|$acc - $rdec Q| = t + C. \]
Solving for \(Q\), we get 
\[ Q = $qeq - A e^{-$rdec t}, \]
where \(A = \pm {e^{-$rdec C}\over $rdec}\).  With \(Q(0) = 0\), 
\[ Q = $qeq ( 1 - e^{$rdec t} ). \]

Note that no matter what the initial condition is, the same
equilibrium solution will be attained.
