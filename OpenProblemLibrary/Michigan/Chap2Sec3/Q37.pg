A child inflates a balloon, admires it for a while and then lets the

balloon at time \( t \), then the figure below shows  \( V'(t) \) as a
function of \( t \).

The child begins inflating the balloon when \( V'(t) \) becomes positive,
which is when the volume of the balloon starts increasing.  This is at 
\(t = 3\).  The child finishes inflating the balloon when the volume stops
increasing, which is at \(t = 9\).  The child begins letting the air out
of the balloon when the volume starts decreasing, which is where 
\(V'(t)\) first becomes negative, which is at \(t=14\).
