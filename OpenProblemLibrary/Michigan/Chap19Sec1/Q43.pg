$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
For a flat surface, flux through \(\vec{A}\) is
\(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{A}\).  Therefore, the
flux through each face of the cube is equal to
\(($vecV) \cdot (\vec{A} \mbox{ of the face})\).
$PAR
First we shall find the flux through the two faces parallel to the \(yz\)
plane, beginning with the one with positive \(x\).  A unit vector normal to
this plane pointing outward is \(\vec i\).  Therefore
\(\vec{A}= $ssq\vec i\).  The flux then equals
\[ ($vecV) \cdot ($ssq\vec i) = $xpflux. \]
For the face with negative \(x\), the unit normal vector pointing
outward is \(-\vec i\). Therefore \(\vec{A} = -$ssq\vec i\).
The flux then equals
\[($vecV) \cdot (-$ssq\vec i) = $xnflux.\]

$PAR
Next, we will find the flux through the two faces parallel to the
\(xz\)-plane, beginning with the one with positive \(y\).  A unit
vector normal to this face pointing outward is \(\vec j\).  Therefore
\(\vec{A} = $ssq\vec j\). The flux then equals
\[($vecV) \cdot ($ssq\vec j) = $ypflux.\]
For the face with negative \(y\), the unit normal vector pointing
outward is \(-\vec j\). Therefore \(\vec{A} = -$ssq\vec j\).  The
flux then equals
\[($vecV) \cdot (-$ssq\vec j) = $ynflux.\]

$PAR
Finally, we will find the flux through the two faces parallel to the
\(xy\)-plane, beginning with the one with positive \(z\). The unit
vector normal to this face and pointing outward is \(\vec k\).  The
area of the face equals \($ssq\), so \(\vec{A} = $ssq\vec k\).
The flux through the face with positive \(z\) equals
\[($vecV) \cdot ($ssq\vec k) = $zpflux.\]
For the face with negative \(z\), the unit normal vector that points
outward is \(-\vec k\). Therefore \(\vec{A} = -$ssq\vec k\).  The flux through
this face is given by
\[($vecV) \cdot (-$ssq)\vec k = $znflux. \]

$PAR
Adding up all of these fluxes to get the flux out of the entire cube,
we get
\[ \hbox{Total flux} = ($xpflux)+($xnflux)+($ypflux)+($ynflux)+
    ($zpflux)+($znflux) = 0. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
For any constant vector field \(\vec{v} = a\vec i + b\vec j + c\vec k\), we
can calculate the flux out of the cube by the same method.
$PAR
Let's find flux out of the two faces parallel to the \(xy\)
plane, beginning with the one with negative \(z\). A unit vector normal to
this plane, that points negative (because of the orientation of the face)
is \(-\vec k\).  The area of the face equals $ssq, therefore
\vec{A} = -$ssq\vec k\).
The flux through \(\vec{A}\) then equals
\[(a\vec i + b\vec j + c\vec k) \cdot (-$ssq\vec k) = 0+0-$ssq c = -$ssq c.\]
For the face with positive \(z\), the unit normal vector pointing
outward  is \(\vec k\) and we similarly get a flux through the face of
\[(a\vec i + b\vec j + c\vec k) \cdot ($ssq\vec k) = 0+0+$ssq c = $ssq c.\]

$PAR
The calculation for the other faces proceeds similarly, and we see that
the contribution through each pair of opposite faces will cancel, so that
the total flux will be zero.

$PAR
The answers in parts (a) and (b) make sense because the vector field is
constant, and so it does not change as it comes in the one side of the
cube, and exits the other side.  Therefore the two fluxes cancel each
other out, making the total flux zero.
