Two independent random numbers \(x\) and \(y\) between 0 and 1
have joint density function
\[
p(x,y)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if } 0 \le x,y \le 1 \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
This problem concerns the weighted average \(z=(x+ $a y)/$ap1\),
which has a one-variable probability density function  of its own.

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
If \(t\le 0\), then \(F(t)=0\) because the weighted average of
two positive numbers can not be negative.  If \(1 <t\) then
for all \(x,y\le 1\) \(z\le t\), so \(F(t) = 1\) (we can see this
by noting that the largest value of \(z\) is when \((x,y) = 1\),
where point \(z = 1\)).
$PAR
Then, for any \(0\le t\le 1\), we have
\(F(t)= \int_R p(x,y)dA\) where \(R\) is the region of the plane defined
by \((x+ $a y)/$ap1 \le t\).  Since \(p(x,y)=0\) outside the unit square,
we need  integrate only over the part  of \(R\) that lies inside the square,
and since \(p(x,y)=1\) inside the square, the integral equals the  area
of that part of the square.  Thus, we can  calculate the area using
area formulas.  For \(0< t\le \frac1{$ap1}\), we draw the line
\((x+ $a y)/$ap1 = t\), as shown below.
$BR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph( $gr1 ), tex_size=>200, height=>200, width=>200,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph showing a diagonal line with ' .
	 'negative slope cutting off a triangular region in ' .
	 'the first quadrant, with x- and y-intercepts less than one."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$BR
The \(x\) intercept is \(x = $ap1 t\) and the \(y\) intercept is
\(y = \frac{$ap1}{$a}t\), so the area of the triangle is
\[ F(t) = $ap1sqo2a\,t^2. \]
$PAR
For \(\frac{1}{$ap1}< t\le \frac{$a}{$ap1}\), the line has \(y\)-intercept
\(y = \frac{$ap1}{$a}t\) and when \(x=1\) we have
\(y = \frac{$ap1}{$a}t - \frac{1}{$a}\), as shown in the figure below.
$BR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph( $gr2 ), tex_size=>200, height=>200, width=>200,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph showing a diagonal line with ' .
	 'negative slope cutting off a trapezoidal region in ' .
	 'the first quadrant, bounded on the left and right by ' .
	 'x=0 and x=1."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$BR
The area of the trapezoid is then the area of the rectangular region at
the bottom plus the area of the triangle above it, or
\[ F(t) = (\frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t - \frac1{$a}) +
	  \frac12(\frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t - \frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t + \frac1{$a})
    = \frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t - \frac1{$twoa}. \]
$PAR
Finally, if \(\frac{$a}{$ap1} < t \le 1\), the region is all of the
square less a top triangle, as shown in the next figure.

$BR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph( $gr3 ), tex_size=>200, height=>200, width=>200,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph showing a diagonal line with ' .
	 'negative slope extending from y=1 for positive x down to ' .
	 'x=1 for positive y.  the area being considered is all of ' .
	 'the region with x between 0 and 1 and y between 0 and 1 ' .
	 'less the region above the triangle."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$BR
The line crosses \(y=1\) when \(1 = \frac{$ap1}{$a}t - \frac1{$a}\,x\),
or \(x = $ap1\,t - $a\), so the base of the triangular region has length
\(1 - x = $ap1 - $ap1\,t\).  The line leaves the region when \(x=1\), so
that \(y = \frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t - \frac{1}{$a}\), so the height is
\(1 - y = 1 + \frac{1}{$a} - \frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t = \frac{1}{$a}($ap1 - $ap1\,t)\).
The area is then
\[ F(t) = 1 - \frac1{$twoa}($ap1 - $ap1\,t)^2. \]
$PAR
Thus,
\[
F(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & t\le 0\\
$ap1sqo2a\,t^2 & 0 < t \le \frac1{$ap1} \\
\frac{$ap1}{$a}\,t-\frac1{$a} & \frac1{$ap1} < t\le \frac{$a}{$ap1} \\
1 - \frac1{$twoa}($ap1 - $ap1\,t)^2 & \frac{$a}{$ap1} < t\le 1\\
1 & 1 < t
\end{cases}
\]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The probability density function \(f(t)\) of \(z\) is the
derivative of its cumulative
distribution function.  We have
\[
F(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & t\le 0\\
$ap1sqoa\,t & 0 < t \le \frac1{$ap1} \\
\frac{$ap1}{$a} & \frac1{$ap1} < t\le \frac{$a}{$ap1} \\
\frac{$ap1}{$a}($ap1 - $ap1\,t) & \frac{$a}{$ap1} < t\le 1\\
0 & 1 < t
\end{cases}
\]
This is shown in the graph below.

The values of \(x\) and \(y\) and equally likely to be near \(0,1/2\), and
\(1\).  Notice from the graph of the density function in the figure above
that even though \(x\) and \(y\) separately are equally likely to be
anywhere between 0 and 1, their weighted average \(z=(x+ $a y)/$ap1\)
is more likely to be near \(1/2\) than to be near 0 or 1.
