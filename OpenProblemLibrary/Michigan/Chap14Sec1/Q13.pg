The following questions refer to the table shown below, giving
the temperature adjusted for wind-chill, \( C \), in
\({}^\circ\) F, as a function \( f(w,T) \) of the wind
speed, \( w \), in mph, and the temperature, \( T \), in
\({}^\circ\) F. The temperature adjusted for wind-chill tells
you how cold it feels, as a result of the combination
of wind and temperature.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
For \( f_w($w0, $t0) \)
we know
\[ f_w(w_0, t_0) \approx \frac{f(w_0 + h,t_0) - f(w_0,t_0)}{h}. \]
$fwmsg
Thus, we have
\[ f_w($w0, $t0) \approx \frac{$fwnum}{5} = $fwval. \]
$PAR
$fwaltans

This means that when the wind speed is $w0 mph
and the true temperature is $t0 \({}^\circ\) F,
as the wind speed increases from $w0 mph by 1 mph
we feel an approximately \($fwval^\circ\) F
drop in temperature.  This rate is negative because the temperature
you feel drops as the wind speed increases.

$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
For \( f_t($w1, $t1) \)
we know
\[ f_t(w_0, t_0) \approx \frac{f(w_0,t_0 + h) - f(w_0,t_0)}{h}. \]
$ftmsg
Thus, we have
\[ f_t($w1, $t1) \approx \frac{$ftnum}{5} = $ftval. \]
$PAR
$ftaltans

This means that when the wind speed is $w1 mph
and the true temperature is $t1 \({}^\circ\) F,
the apparent temperature increases by approximately
\($ftval^\circ\) F for an increase of \(1^\circ\) F
in the true temperature.  This rate is positive because
the temperature you feel increases as the true temperature
increases.
