Your monthly car payment in dollars is \( P = f(P_0,t,r) \), where
$DOLLAR\( P_0 \) is the amount you borrowed, \( t \) is the number of months it
takes to pay off the loan, and \( r \) percent is the interest rate.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

\(\partial P /\partial t\): The unit is dollars per month (dollars/month).
This is the rate at which payments change as the number of months it
takes to pay off the loan changes.  The sign is negative because
payments decrease as the pay-off time increases.  Thus
\(\partial P /\partial t = $dpdtans\) dollars/month.

$PAR
\(\partial P /\partial r\): The unit is dollars per percentage point
(dollars/percent).  This is the rate at which payments change as
the interest rate changes.  The sign is positive because payments
increase as the interest rate increases.  Thus
\(\partial P /\partial r = $dpdrans\) dollars/percent.
