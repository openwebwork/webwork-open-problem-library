An experiment to measure the toxicity of formaldehyde yielded the data
in the table below.  The values show the percent, \( P=f(t,c) \),
of rats surviving an exposure to formaldehyde at a concentration of
\( c \) (in parts per million, ppm) after \( t \) months.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We have \(f($t0,$c0) = $f0\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Thus, to estimate \( f_t($t0,$c0) \), we can take
\[ f_t($t0,$c0) \approx \frac{f($t0+2,$c0) - f($t0-2,$c0)}{4} =
    \frac{$f0pt - $f0mt}{4} = $ft. \]
Alternately, we could take either of the two one-sided difference
quotients,
\[ f_t($t0,$c0) \approx \frac{f($t0+2,$c0) - f($t0,$c0)}{2} = $ftp \]
or
\[ f_t($t0,$c0) \approx \frac{f($t0,$c0) - f($t0-2,$c0)}{2} = $ftm. \]
In each case, the units of \(f_t\) are percent per month.  This says
$t0 months after rats are exposed to a formaldehyde concentration
of $c0 ppm, the percent of rats surviving is decreasing at a rate of
about $ftround per month. In other words, during the $t0 month,
around an additional $ftround percent of the rats will die.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Proceeding similarly to find \(f_c($t0,$c0)\), we have
\[ f_c($t0,$c0) \approx \frac{f($t0,$c0+2) - f($t0,$c0-2)}{4} =
    \frac{$f0pc - $f0mc}{4} = $fc, \]
or, with one-sided difference quotients,
\[ f_c($t0,$c0) \approx \frac{f($t0,$c0+2) - f($t0,$c0)}{2} = $fcp \]
or
\[ f_c($t0,$c0) \approx \frac{f($t0,$c0) - f($t0,$c0-2)}{2} = $fcm. \]
These indicate that if the original concentration increases from $c0
by 1 ppm, the percent surviving after $t0 months decreases by about
$fcround.
