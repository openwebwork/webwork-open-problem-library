BEGIN_TEXT

Let \( p \) be the price of an item and \( q \) be the number of items sold at
that price, where \( q=f(p) \).  What do the following quantities mean in
terms of prices and quantities sold?
$PAR
${BBOLD}1.$EBOLD
\( f($a) \) 
\{ $q1->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $q1->print_a() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}2.$EBOLD
\( f^{-1}($b) \)
\{ $q2->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $q2->print_a() \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}1.$EBOLD
\(f($a)\) is \(q\) corresponding to \(p = $a\), or, in other words, the
number of items sold when the price is $a.

$PAR
${BBOLD}2.$EBOLD
\(f^{-1}($b)\) is \(p\) corresponding to \(q = $b\), or the price at
which $b units will be sold.
