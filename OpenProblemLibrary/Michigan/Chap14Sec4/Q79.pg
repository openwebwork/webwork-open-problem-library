BEGIN_TEXT

You are climbing a  mountain by  the steepest route at a
slope of \( $a^\circ \) when you come upon a trail branching off at a
\( $b^\circ \) angle from yours.  What is the angle of ascent of the
branch trail?

$PAR
angle = \{ ans_rule(35) \} (in degrees)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let's put a coordinate plane on the area you are hiking,
with your trail along the \(x\)-axis and the second trail branching
off at the origin as suggested in the figure below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image( insertGraph( $gr ), tex_size=>250, height=>250, width=>250,
          extra_html_tags=>'alt="figure with a point at the origin, ' .
          'a blue arrow pointing to the right along the x-axis, and ' .
          'a second, red arrow pointing up into the 1st quadrant."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
You are moving in the positive \(x\) direction. Let
\(h(x,y)\) be the elevation at the point \((x,y)\) on the mountain.
$PAR
Since the trail along the \(x\)-axis ascends at a \($a^\circ\) angle, we
have \(h_x(0,0)  = \tan $a^\circ\).  Since the trail is
the steepest path, \(\nabla h\) must point along your trail in
the positive \(x\) direction.  Thus
\[ \nabla h = h_x\vec i + 0\vec j = \tan $a^\circ \vec i.\]
$PAR

We must compute the rate of change of elevation in the direction of
the branch trail.   The unit vector in this direction is \(\vec u =
\cos $b^\circ \vec i + \sin $b^\circ \vec j\), and thus the
directional derivative is
\[ h_{\vec u} = (\nabla h)\cdot \vec u
    = (\tan $a^\circ \vec i)\cdot (\cos $b^\circ \vec i + \sin $b^\circ
    \vec j) = (\tan $a^\circ)(\cos $b^\circ) = $der. \]
The angle of ascent of the branch trail is thus \(\tan^{-1} ($der) = 
$asc^\circ\).
