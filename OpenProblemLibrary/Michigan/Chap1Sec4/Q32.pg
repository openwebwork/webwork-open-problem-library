BEGIN_TEXT
The population of a region is growing exponentially. There were $a 
million people in 1980 (when \(t=0\)) and $b million people in 1990. 
Find an exponential model for the population (in millions of people) 
at any time \(t\), in years after 1980.

${BITALIC}(Note: if you use decimal approximations for the numerical
constants in your work, be sure to retain enough significant figures
through your work to ensure that subsequent answers are correct.)$EITALIC

$BR
\(P(t)\)=\{ans_rule(25)\}
$BR
What population do you predict for the year 2000?
$BR
Predicted population in the year 2000 =\{ans_rule(25)\} million people.
$BR
What is the doubling time?
$BR
Doubling time =\{ans_rule(25)\} years.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
The population has increased by a factor of \({$b\over $a}=$f\) in 10 years.
Thus we have the formula
\[
P(t)=$a($f)^{t/10},
\]
and \(t/10\) gives the number of 10 year periods that have passed
since 1980.
$PAR
In 1980, \(t/10=0\), so we have \(P=$a\).
$BR
In 1990, \(t/10=1\), so we have \(P=$a($f)=$b\).
$BR
In 2000, \(t/10=2\), so we have \(P=$a($f)^{2}=$h\).
$PAR
To find the doubling time, solve \($i=$a($f)^{t/10}\) by dividing
by $a and taking the natural logarithm of both sides, to get
\(t=10\cdot{\ln(2)\over \ln($f)}\).
