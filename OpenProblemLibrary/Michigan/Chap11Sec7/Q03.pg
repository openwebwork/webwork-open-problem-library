$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

A graph of the slope field with some solutions added is
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($grsol), tex_size=>350, height=>150, width=>250,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of slope field with solutions ' .
         'added."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Thus we get different solution behaviors for the initial conditions
\(P(0) = $p0\), \(P(0) > $p0\), and \(0 < P(0) < $p0\).  The initial
condition \(P(0) = 0\) gives the zero solution, which is an equilibrium
and has the same behavior as the initial condition \(P(0) = $p0\).  Note
that we can also say that the behavior for initial conditions
\(0 < P(0) < $p0o2\) is different from that for initial conditions
\($p0o2 \le P(0) < $p0\), because the former will be sigmoidal while
the latter are strictly exponential.
$PAR

From the solutions graphed above, or by looking at the slope field,
we can see that the equilibrium solution \(P = $p0\) is stable.  The
other equilibrium solution, \(P = 0\) is unstable.

$PAR
Also by looking at the solution curves, we can see that \(P\) is
increasing when \(0 < P < $p0\) and decreasing when \(P > $p0\).
In the long run, we're most likely to start with a non-zero population
and thus \(P\to $p0\).  The solution curves with initial populations
of less than \(P= $p0o2\) have inflection points at \(P=$p0o2\). (This will
be demonstrated algebraically below.)  At the inflection point,
the population is growing fastest.

$PAR
A graph of \(dP/dt\) against \(P\) is shown below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($grsol2), tex_size=>250, height=>150, width=>250,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of a downward opening parabola ' .
	 'with zeros at 0 and $p0."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Since \(\frac{dP}{dt}=$ap0 P - $a P^2 = $a P($p0 - P)\), the graph of
\(\frac{dP}{dt}\) against \(P\) is a parabola, opening downward with
\(P\) intercepts at 0 and $p0.
The quantity \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is positive for \(0 < P < $p0\),
negative for \(P > $p0\) (and \(P < 0\)).  The quantity
\(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is 0 at \(P=0\) and \(P=$P0\), and maximum
at \(P=$p0o2\).
The fact that \(\frac{dP}{dt} =0\) at \(P=0\) and \(P=$p0\) tells us that
these are equilibria.  Further, since \(\frac{dP}{dt}> 0\) for \(0 < P
< $p0\), we see that solution curves starting here will increase toward
\(P=$p0\).
$PAR

If the population starts at a value \(P<$p0o2\), it increases at
an increasing rate up to \(P=$p0o2\).  After this, \(P\) continues
to increase, but at a decreasing rate.  The fact that \(\frac{dP}{dt}\)
has a maximum at \(P=$p0o2\) tells us that there is a point of
inflection when \(P=$p0o2\).  Similarly, since \(\frac{dP}{dt} < 0\) for
\(P > $p0\), solution curves starting with \(P > 1\) will decrease to \(P =
$p0\).  Thus, \(P=$p0\) is a stable equilibrium.
