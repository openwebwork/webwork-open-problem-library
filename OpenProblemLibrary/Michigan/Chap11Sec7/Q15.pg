BEGIN_TEXT

Any population, \(P\), for which we can ignore
immigration, satisfies
\[\frac{dP}{dt} =\hbox{Birth rate} - \hbox{Death rate}.\]

For organisms which
need a partner for reproduction but
rely on a chance encounter for meeting a mate, the
birth rate is
proportional to the square of the population.  Thus, the population of
such a type of organism satisfies a differential equation of the form
\[ \frac{dP}{dt} = a P^2 - b P\quad\hbox{with } a,\,b>0. \]
This problem investigates the solutions to such an equation.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
A graph of \(dP/dt\) vs \(P\) is shown below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($gr1), tex_size=>250, height=>150, width=>250,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of an upward-opening parabola ' .
	 'with zeros at 0 and b/a."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Thus, \(dP/dt\) is negative when \(0 < P < b/a\) and positive when
\(b/a < P < \infty\) (we ignore \(P < 0\), because this doesn't make
sense for a population).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD

We can see from the graph above that \(P\) is a decreasing function when
\(P<\frac{b}{a}\).  Similarly, when \(P>\frac{b}{a}\), the sign of 
\(dP/dt\) is
positive, so \(P\) is an increasing function.  Thus solution curves
starting above \(\frac{b}{a}\) are increasing, and those starting below
\(\frac{b}{a}\) are decreasing.
$PAR
We can also see that for \(P>\frac{b}{a}\), the slope,
\(\frac{dP}{dt}\), increases with \(P\),
so the graph of \(P\) against \(t\) is concave up. For \(0<P<\frac{b}{a}\),
the value of \(P\) decreases with time.  As \(P\) decreases, the slope
\(\frac{dP}{dt}\) decreases for \(\frac{b}{2a}<P<\frac{b}{a}\), and increases
toward 0 for \(0<P<\frac{b}{2a}\).  Thus solution curves starting just
below the threshold value of \(\frac{b}{a}\) are concave down for
\(\frac{b}{2a}<P<\frac{b}{a}\) and concave up and asymptotic to the
\(t\)-axis for \(0<P<\frac{b}{2a}\).  Thus, solution curves are similar
to those shown in the graph below
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($gr2), tex_size=>250, height=>150, width=>250,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of three solution curves, one ' .
         'starting above b/a and increasing exponentially, one ' .
         'starting just below b/a and decreasing in a sigmoidal shape ' .
         'to asymptotically approach 0, and one that starts and ' .
         'remains at b/a."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
\(P=\frac{b}{a}\) is called the threshold population because for
populations greater than \(\frac{b}{a}\), the population will increase
without bound. For populations less than \(\frac{b}{a}\), the population
will go to zero, i.e. to extinction.  The value \(\frac{b}{a}\) is
an unstable equilibrium, and \(P=0\) is a stable equilibrium.
