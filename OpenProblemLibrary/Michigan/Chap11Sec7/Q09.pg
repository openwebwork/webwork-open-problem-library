The total number of people infected with a virus often grows like a
logistic curve.  Suppose that $p0 people originally have the
virus, and that in the early stages of the virus (with time, \(t\),
measured in weeks), the number of people infected is increasing
exponentially with \(k=$k\).  It is estimated that, in the long run,
approximately $L people become infected.

vertical coordinate at this point?

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
We know that a logistic curve can be modeled by the function
\[P=\frac{L}{1+Ce^{-kt}}\]
where \(C=(L-P_0)/P_0\) and \(P\) is the number of people infected by
the virus at a particular time \(t\). We know that \(L\) is the limiting
value, or the maximal number of people infected with the virus, so
in our case
\[L=$L.\]
We are also told that initially there are only $p0 people infected
with the virus so that we get
\(P_0=$p0.\)
Thus we have
\[ C = \frac{L-P_0}{P_0} = \frac{$L-$p0}{$p0} = $c. \]
We are also told that in the early stages of the virus, infection
grows exponentially with \(k=$k\). Thus we get that the logistic
function for people infected is
\[P=\frac{$L}{1+$c e^{-$k t}}.\]

Graphing this solution, we see

\{ image(insertGraph($solgr), tex_size=>300, height=>150, width=>250,
         extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of a logistic (sigmoidal) ' .
	 'curve starting at $p0, increasing at an increasing rate ' .
	 'until the vertical coordinate is approximately $vert, ' .
	 'and then approaching the limiting value $L."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Looking at the graph we see that the the point at which the rate
changes from increasing to decreasing, the inflection point, occurs at
roughly \(t=$irnd\) giving a value of \(P=$vrnd\). Thus after roughly
$vrnd people have been infected, the rate of infection starts dropping.
