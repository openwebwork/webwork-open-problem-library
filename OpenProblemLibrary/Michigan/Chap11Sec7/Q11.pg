BEGIN_TEXT

It is of considerable interest to policy makers to model the
spread of information through a population.  For example, various
agricultural ministries use models to help them understand the spread of
technical innovations or new seed types through their countries.
Two models, based on how the information is spread, are given
below.  Assume the population is of a constant size \(M\), and
let \(P\) (a function of time, \(t\)) be the number of people in
that population who have the information of interest.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
If the information is spread by mass media (TV, radio,
newspapers), the rate at which information is spread is believed to be
proportional (with constant of proportionality \(k>0\)) to the number of
people not having the information at that time.  Write a differential
equation for the number of people having the information by time \(t\).
$BR
\(\frac{dP}{dt} = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$PAR
Sketch a solution assuming that no one (except the mass media)
has the information initially.  What is the limiting value of the
population that knows the information?
$BR
\(P\to\) \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR
At what value of \(P\) is the number of people who know the
information increasing the fastest?
$BR
When \(P = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
If the information is spread by word of mouth, the rate of
spread of information is believed to be proportional (again,
with constant of proportionality \(k>0\)) to the
product of the number of people who know and the number who
don't.  Write a differential equation for the number of people
having the information by time \(t\).
$BR
\(\frac{dP}{dt} = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
Sketch the solution for the cases in which
(i) no one; (ii) 5 percent of the population; and (iii) 75 percent
of the population initially knows the information.

$PAR
What is the limiting value for the population that knows the
information in each case?
$BR
If no one initially knows, \(P \to \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
If 5 percent initially know, \(P \to \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
If 75 percent initially know, \(P \to \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}

$PAR
In the latter two cases, when is the information spreading fastest?
$BR
If 5 percent initially know, when \(P = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
If 75 percent initially know, when \(P = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
With \(P\) as the number of informed people at time \(t\), and \(P_0\) the
number who know initially, this model predicts
that \(\frac{dP}{dt} = k(M-P)\).  Solving this, we find the solution is
\[P = M - (M - P_0)e^{-kt}.\]
We sketch the solution with \(P_0=0\) below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($gr1), tex_size=>250, height=>150, width=>250,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of an exponential function ' .
	 'starting at (0,0) and increasing asymptotically to the ' .
	 'vertical coordinate M."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Notice that \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is largest when \(I\) is smallest, so the
information spreads fastest in the beginning, at \(t=0\).  In addition,
the graph below shows that \(I\rightarrow M\) as \(t\rightarrow\infty\),
meaning that everyone gets the information eventually.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
In this case, the model suggests that
\(\frac{dP}{dt} = k P (M-P)\).
This is a logistic model with carrying capacity \(M\).  We sketch the
solutions for three different values of \(P_0\) below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($gr2), tex_size=>250, height=>150, width=>250,
	 extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of a three functions: a ' .

	 'starting at (0,0.05 M) and increasing asymptotically to the ' .
	 'vertical coordinate M; an exponential function that starts ' .
	 'at (0,0.75 M) and increases asymptotically to M, and the ' .
	 'function zero."') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
If \(P_{0} = 0\) then \(P = 0\) for all \(t\).  In other
words, if nobody knows something, it does not spread by word of mouth!
$PAR
If \(P_{0} = 0.05M\), then \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is increasing up to
\(P = \frac M2\) (half the population).  Thus,
the information is spreading fastest at \(P =\frac M2\).
$PAR
If \(P_{0} = 0.75M\), then \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is always decreasing
for \(P > \frac M2\), so \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is largest when \(t = 0\),
and \(P = 0.75 M\).
