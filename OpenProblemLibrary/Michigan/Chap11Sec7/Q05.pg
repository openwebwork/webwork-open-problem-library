## the derivatives at t=1980, 1985 and 1990 are reasonably

The table below gives the percentage, \( P\), of households
with a VCR, as a function of year.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{begintable(8)\}
\{row( "Year", "1978", "1979", "1980", "1981", "1982", "1983", "1984")\}

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
A logistic model is a good one to use for these data.  Explain why this
might be the case: logically, how large would the growth in VCR ownership
be when they are first introduced?  How large can the ownership ever be?
$BR
We can also investigate this by estimating the growth rate of \(P\) for
the given data.  Do this at the beginning, middle, and near
the end of the data:
$BR
\(P'(1980) \approx\) \{ ans_rule(15) \} $BR
\(P'(1985) \approx\) \{ ans_rule(15) \} $BR
\(P'(1990) \approx\) \{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
Be sure you can explain why this suggests that a logistic model
is appropriate.

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Use the data to estimate the year when the point of inflection
of \( P \) occurs.$BR
The inflection point occurs approximately at
\{ $mp->ans_rule(10) \}. $BR
${BITALIC}(Give the year in which it occurs.)$EITALIC
$PAR
What percent of households had VCRs then?
\(P =\) \{ $mp->ans_rule(10) \}

$PAR
What limiting value \( L \) does this point of inflection predict
(note that if the logistic model is reasonable, this prediction
should agree with the data for 1990 and 1991)?
$BR
\( L = \) \{ $mp->ans_rule(10) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The best logistic equation (solution to the logistic differential
equation) for these data turns out to be the following.
\[
P=\frac{75}{1+316.75e^{-0.699t}}.
\]

What limiting value does this predict?$BR
\( L = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The logistic model is a reasonable one because at first very few
houses have a VCR. As movie rentals become popular and as VCRs get
cheaper, more people will buy VCRs. However, we know that the
rate of VCR buying will start slowing down at some point as it is
impossible for more than 100
$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
To find the point of inflection, we must find the year at which the
rate of VCR buying changes from increasing to
decreasing. The following table
shows the rate of change \(=(P(y+1)-P(y))/1\) in the
years from 1978 to 1990.
$PAR

$BCENTER
\{ begintable(8) \}
\{ row( "Year", "1978", "1979", "1980", "1981", "1982", "1983", "1984" ) \}
\{ row("Change per year", "0.2", "0.6", "0.7", "1.3", "2.4", "5.1", "10.2") \}
\{ row( "Year", "1985", "1986", "1987", "1988", "1989", "1990", "1991" ) \}
\{ row("Change per year", "15.2", "12.7", "9.3", "6.6", "7.3", "0", "") \}
\{ endtable() \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Looking at the table, we see that the rate of percent change per year
changes from increasing to decreasing in the year 1986. At this time
(at the inflection point) we expect the vertical coordinate to be \(L/2\),
one-half of the limiting value for the population.  Thus
we have
\(L/2 = 36\), or \(L = 72\), which fits in well with
the data that we have for 1990 and 1991.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Since the general form of a logistic equation is
\[P=\frac{L}{1+Ce^{-kt}}\]
where \(L\) is the limiting value, we have that in our case \(L=75\)
and the limiting value is 75.
