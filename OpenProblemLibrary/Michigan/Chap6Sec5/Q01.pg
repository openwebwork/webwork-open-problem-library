BEGIN_TEXT

An object is thrown upward at time \( t=0 \). After \( t \) seconds,
its height is \( y = -4.9 t^2 + $v t + $h \) meters above the ground.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
From what height was the object thrown?  \{ ans_rule(25) \} meters
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
What is the initial velocity of the object? \{ ans_rule(25) \} m/s
$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
What is the acceleration due to gravity? \{ ans_rule(25) \} m/s\({}^2\)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The object is thrown from an initial height of \(y=$h\) meters.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The velocity is obtained by differentiating,
which gives \(v=-9.8t+ $v\) m/s. The initial velocity is
\(v=$v\) m/sec upward.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The acceleration due to gravity is obtained by differentiating again,
giving \(g=-9.8\) m/s\({}^2\), or 9.8 m/sec\({}^2\) downward.
