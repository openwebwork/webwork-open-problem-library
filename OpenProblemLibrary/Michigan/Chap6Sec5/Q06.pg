On the moon the acceleration due to gravity is 5 ft/sec\({}^2\).
An astronaut jumps into the air with an
initial upward velocity of $v0 ft/sec.
$PAR
How high does she/he go?
\{ ans_rule(25) \} feet
$PAR
How long is the astronaut off the ground?
\{ ans_rule(25) \} sec.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let time $t=0$ be the moment when the astronaut jumps up.
If acceleration due to gravity is 5 ft/sec\({}^2\)
and initial velocity is $v0 ft/sec, then the velocity of the
astronaut is described by
\[ v(t)=$v0 - 5t.\]
Suppose \(y(t)\) describes her/his distance from the surface
of the moon.  By the Fundamental Theorem,
\[ y(t)-y(0) = \int_0^t ($v0 - 5x) \, dx = $v0 t-\frac{1}{2}5t^2,\]
since \(y(0)=0\) (assuming the astronaut jumps off the surface of the
moon).

$PAR
The astronaut reaches the maximum height when her/his velocity is \(0\),
i.e. when
\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = v(t) = $v0 - 5t = 0.\]
Solving for \(t\), we get \(t=$t1\) sec as the time at which she/he reaches the
maximum height from the surface of the moon. At this time his height is
\[
y($t1) = $v0 ($t1) - \frac12 5($t1)^2= $h \hbox{ ft.}
\]
When the astronaut is at height \(y=0\), she/he either just landed or is
about to jump. To find how long it is before he comes
back down, we find when he is at height \(y=0\). Set
\(y(t)=0\) to get
\[ 0 = $v0 t - \frac{1}{2} 5 t^2 = t ( $v0 - \frac52\, t ) \]
So we have \(t=0\) sec (when she/he jumps off) and
\(t=$t\) sec  (when he lands, which
gives the time he spent in the air).
