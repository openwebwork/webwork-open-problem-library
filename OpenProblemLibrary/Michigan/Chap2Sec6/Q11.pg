The acceleration due to gravity, \( g \), varies with height above the
surface of the earth, in a certain way.  If you go down below the
surface of the earth, \( g \) varies in a different way.  It can be shown
that \( g \) is given by
\[
g = \frac{GMr}{R^3},
\]
when \(r<R\), and 
\[
g = \frac{GM}{r^2},
\]
when \(r\geq R\).  Here \(R\)  is the radius of the earth,  \(M\)  is the
mass of the earth,  \(G\)  is the gravitational constant, and  \(r\)  is
the distance to the center of the earth.
$PAR
Sketch a graph of  \(g\)  against  \(r\), and use it to answer the
following questions:
$PAR

Is  \(g\)  a continuous function of  \(r\)?

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
The graph certainly looks continuous.  The only point in question
is \(r=R\).  Using the second formula with \(r=R\) gives
\[
g=\frac{GM}{R^2}.
\]
Then, using the first formula with \(r\) approaching \(R\) from below,
we see that as we get close to the surface of the earth
\[
g\approx \frac{GMR}{R^3}=\frac{GM}{R^2}.
\]
Since we get the same value for \(g\) from both formulas, \(g\)
is continuous.

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
For \(r<R\), the graph of \(g\) is a line with a positive slope of
\(\frac{GM}{R^3}\).  For \(r>R\), the graph of \(g\) looks like
\(1/x^2\), and so has a negative slope.  Therefore the graph has
a ``corner'' at \(r=R\) and so is not differentiable there.

BEGIN_TEXT

An electric current flowing along a wire of radius \(r_0\) produces a magnetic field.  At a point \(r\) units of distance from the center of the wire the strength \(B\) of the magnetic field is:
\[
B = \frac{r}{r_0}\,B_0
\]
when \(r \le r_0\), and
\[
B = \frac{r_0}{r}\,B_0
\]
when \(r > r_0\).  Here \(r_0\) and \(B_0\) are positive constants.
$PAR
Sketch a graph of  \(B\)  against  \(r\), and use it to answer the
following questions.  As you do so, think about what the meaning of
the constant \(B_0\) is.
