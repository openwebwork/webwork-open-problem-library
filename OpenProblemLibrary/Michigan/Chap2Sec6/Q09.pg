Decide if the following function \(f(x)\) is differentiable at \(x=0\).
Try zooming in on a graphing calculator, or calculating the derivative
\(f'(0)\) from the definition.

\[
     f(x) = x$rexp\sin($b/x),
\]
if \( x \ne 0 \), and
\[
     f(x) = 0
\]
if \( x = 0 \).

$PAR
If it is differentiable, what is the derivative?  (If it isn't, enter
${BBOLD}dne$EBOLD.)
$BR
\( f'(0) = \) \{ ans_rule(5) \}

We can see by graphing it on a calculator that the graph of \(f\)
oscillates infinitely often between the curves \(y=x^$r\) and
\(y=-x^$r\) near the origin.  Thus the slope of the line from
\((0,0)\) to \((h,f(h))\) oscillates between \(h$rm1\) (when \(f(h)=h^$r\),
\(\frac{f(h)-0}{h-0}=h$rm1\))
and \(-h$rm1\) (when \(f(h)=-h^$r\), \(\frac{f(h)-0}{h-0}=-h$rm1\))
as \(h\) tends to zero.  So, the limit of the slope as \(h\) tends to zero
is 0, which is the derivative of \(f\) at the origin.  Another way to see
this is to observe that
\[
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h} =
\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{h^$r\sin(\frac{$b}{h})}{h}\right),
\]
which is
\[
\lim_{h\to0}\left(h$rm1\sin(\frac{$b}{h})\right) = 0.
\]
since \(\lim\limits_{h\to0}h=0\) and \(-1\leq\sin(\frac{$b}{h})\leq1\) for
any \(h\).  Thus \(f\) is differentiable at \(x=0\), and \(f'(0)=0\).

We can see by graphing it on a calculator that the graph of \(f\)
oscillates infinitely often between the curves \(y=x\) and 
\(y=-x\) near the origin.  Thus the slope of the line from 
\((0,0)\) to \((h,f(h))\) oscillates between \(1\) (when \(f(h)=h\) and
\(\frac{f(h)-0}{h-0}=1\)) 
and \(-1\) (when \(f(h)=-h\), \(\frac{f(h)-0}{h-0}=-1\))
as \(h\) tends to zero.  So, the limit of the slope as \(h\) tends to zero
is not defined, and \(f'(0)\) does not exist.  Another way to see
this is to observe that
\[
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h} = 
\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{h\sin(\frac{$b}{h})}{h}\right),
\]
which is 
\[
\lim_{h\to0}\left(\sin(\frac{$b}{h})\right),
\]
and since \(\sin(\frac{$b}{h})\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\)
(faster and faster!) as \(h\to0\), this limit cannot exist.
Thus \(f\) is not differentiable at \(x=0\), and \(f'(0)\) does not
exist.
