Suppose that a spacecraft near Neptune has measured a quantity \( A \) and
sent it to earth in the form of a periodic signal \( A\cos t \) of
amplitude \( A \).  On its way to earth, the signal picks up periodic
noise, containing only second and higher harmonics.  Suppose that the
signal \( h(t) \) actually received on earth is graphed below.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The signal received on earth is in the form of a periodic function
\(h(t)\), which can be expanded in a Fourier series
\[ h(t) = a_0 + a_1\cos t + a_2\cos 2t  + a_3\cos 3t + \cdots +
	b_1\sin t + b_2\sin 2t + b_3\sin3t + \cdots \]

$PAR
If the periodic noise consists of ${BITALIC}only$EITALIC the second and higher
harmonics of the Fourier series, then the original signal contributed
the fundamental harmonic plus the constant term, i.e.,
\[ \mbox{constant term} + \mbox{fundamental harmonic} = a_0 +
    a_1\cos t +b_1\sin t = A\cos t =
    \mbox{original signal}. \]
$PAR

In order to find \(A\), we need to find \(a_0\), \(a_1\), and \(b_1\).
Looking at the graph of \(h(t)\), we see
\[ a_0  =  \mbox{average value of} h(t) =
    \frac{1}{2\pi} (\mbox{Area above the axis} - \mbox{Area under the axis})
    = 0 \]
(which we can see by adding the areas in the graph).
$PAR

Then
\[ a_1 = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} h(t)\cos t \,dt, \]
which we can find by breaking it into the different sections over which
\(h(t)\) is defined:
\[ a_1 = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(
    \int_{-\pi}^{-3\pi/4}\,$y2\,\cos t\,dt +
    \int_{-\pi/2}^{-\pi/4}\,$y1\,\cos t\,dt +
    \int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\,$y0\,\cos t\,dt + \right.\]
\[ \left.
    \int_{\pi/4}^{-\pi/2}\,$y1\,\cos t\,dt +
    \int_{3\pi/4}^{\pi}\,$y2\,\cos t\,dt\right).
\]
Evaluating these, we get \( a_1 = $a \).
$PAR

Finally, we note that
\[ b_1 = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}h(t)\sin t\,dt=0 \]
because \(h(t)\sin t\) is an odd function.
$PAR

Substituting in, we get
\[ a_0 + a_1\cos t + b_1\sin t = 0 + $a \cos t + 0 = A\cos t.\]
So \( A= $a\).
