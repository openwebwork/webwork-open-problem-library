In this problem, consider the pulse train of width \( c \)
specified by the periodic function \( f \) of period \( 2\pi \)
\[ f(x) =  \begin{cases}0,	&  -\pi \leq x < -c/2  \cr
		  1,	&  -c/2 \leq x <  c/2  \cr
		  0,	&   c/2 \leq x < \pi. \cr\end{cases} \]

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The energy of the pulse train \(f\) is, for any \(c\),
\[ E = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (f(x))^2\,dx =
    \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} 1^2\, dx =
    \frac{c}{\pi}. \]
To find the energy of the different harmonics, we need to find
the Fourier coefficients:
\[ a_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\,dx =
    \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-c/2}^{c/2}(1)\,dx = \frac{c}{2\pi}. \]
Similarly,
\[ a_k = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\cos kx \,dx =
    \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} \cos kx \,dx =
    \frac{1}{k\pi}\,\sin kx \bigg|_{-c/2}^{c/2} =
    \frac{2}{k\pi}\,\sin(\frac{ck}{2}) \]
and
\[ b_k = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\sin kx \,dx =
    \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-c/2}^{c/2}\sin kx \,dx =
    -\frac{1}{k\pi}\cos kx \bigg|_{-c/2}^{c/2} = 0. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Thus, when \(c = $w0\),
$BR
(i) The fraction of the energy of \(f\) in the constant term is
\[ \frac{A_0^2}{E} = \frac{2 a_0^2}{E} =
    \frac{2 ($w0)^2}{4\pi^2}\cdot\frac{\pi}{$w0} =
    \frac{$w0}{2\pi} \approx $e0w0. \]
$BR
(ii) The fraction of the energy of \(f\) in the constant term and
first harmonic together is
\[ \frac{A_0^2 + A_1^2}{E} =
    \left(\frac{2($w0)^2}{4\pi^2} + \frac{4}{\pi^2}\sin^2(\frac{$w0}{2})\right)
        \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{$w0}\right) \approx $e1w0. \]
$BR
(iii) The energy in the \(k\)th harmonic of \(f\) is just
\[ A_k^2 = a_k^2 = \frac{4}{k^2\pi^2}\,\sin^2(\frac{$w0}{2}k). \]
$BR
(iv) $solans

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
With \(c = $w1\),
$BR
(i) The fraction of the energy of \(f\) in the constant term is
\[ \frac{A_0^2}{E} = \frac{2 a_0^2}{E} =
    \frac{2 ($w1)^2}{4\pi^2}\cdot\frac{\pi}{$w1} =
    \frac{$w1}{2\pi} \approx $e0w1. \]
$BR
(ii) The fraction of the energy of \(f\) in the constant term and
first harmonic together is
\[ \frac{A_0^2 + A_1^2}{E} =
    \left(\frac{2($w1)^2}{4\pi^2} + \frac{4}{\pi^2}\sin^2($w121)\right)
        \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{$w1}\right) \approx $e1w1. \]
$BR
(iii) The energy in the \(k\)th harmonic of \(f\) is just
\[ A_k^2 = a_k^2 = \frac{4}{k^2\pi^2}\,\sin^2($w12 k). \]
$BR
(iv) To find how many harmonics we need to get 90 percent of the
energy of \(f\), we add up the values for the \(k\)th harmonics until
we get \((0.9)\,E = (0.9)\,(\frac{$w1}{\pi})\).  This is $n1 terms.
