SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The contour diagram for \(f(x,y) = xy/\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) is
\{ $whichFig->correct_ans() \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
By the chain rule, the function \(f\) is differentiable at all points
where \(x^2 + y^2\ne 0\), and so at all points \((x,y)\neq(0,0)\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The partial derivatives of \(f\) at points \((x,y) \neq (0,0)\) are
given by
\[ f_x(x,y) = $fx, \]
and
\[ f_y(x,y) = $fy. \]
Both \(f_x\) and \(f_y\) are continuous for \((x,y)\neq (0,0)\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
This function \(f\) is continuous at \((0,0)\): from the contour
diagram, we can see that this is the case here because the contours
all end at \(f = 0\) on the axes and at the origin.  Thus we can't
tell from the continuity of the function if it is differentiable
at \((0,0)\) or not.

$PAR
If we look at \(x = y = t\), then
$BR
\( f(t,t) = g(t) = \frac{t^2}{\sqrt{2t^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt2}\,|t| \)
(with \(t\ne 0\)).  (Because both \(t^2\) and \(\sqrt{t^2}\) are positive.)
Thus \(g'(t)\) does not exist, and by extension \(f\) is not differentiable.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(e)$EBOLD
At \((0,0)\), the partial derivatives of \(f\) are given by
\[ f_x(0,0) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(h,0)-f(0,0)}{h} =
\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{0-0}{h} = 0,\]
and
\[ f_y(0,0)=\lim_{y\to 0}\frac{f(0,h)-f(0,0)}{h} =
\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{0-0}{h} =0.\]
So the partial derivatives exist.  However, the partial derivatives
are not continuous: if we take \(x=y=t\) for \(t \neq 0\), we have
\[
  f_x(x,y) = f_x(t,t) = \frac{t^3}{(2t^2)^{3/2}} =
    \frac{t^3}{2\sqrt{2}\cdot|t|^3}=
    \cases{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}, & t>0,\cr
           -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}, & t<0.}
\]
Thus, \(f_x\) is not continuous at \((0,0)\).  Similarly,
\(f_y\) is not continuous at \((0,0)\).
