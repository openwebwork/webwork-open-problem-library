BEGIN_TEXT

A man wishes to row the shortest possible distance from
north to south across a river which is flowing at
$rvrspd km/hr from the east.  He can row at
$rowspd km/hr.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
In which direction should he steer?
$BR
At an angle (in degrees) of \{ ans_rule(35) \}
\{ $dir1->menu() \} of south.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Suppose that when the man is in the middle of the river, a wind of
$wndspd km/hr from the southwest starts.
$PAR
In which direction should he steer to move straight across the river?
$BR
At an angle (in degrees) of \{ ans_rule(35) \}
\{ $dir2->menu() \} of south.
$PAR
Which bank of the river will the rower reach first?
$BR
\{ $bank->menu() \} bank.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let \(x\)-axis be the East direction and \(y\)-axis be the North
direction, as suggested in the figure below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image( insertGraph( $solgr ), height=>200, width=>200, tex_size=>250,
	  extra_html_tags=>'alt="figure showing the river and rower ' .
	  'velocities."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
If the rower is going straight across the river we know that his
\(x\) velocity component is equal to the river's velocity (in the
opposite direction), $rvrspd, so that the angle
\[t = \sin ^{-1}($rvrspd/$rowspd) \approx $ang1^{\circ}.\]
That is, he should steer approximately \($ang1^{\circ}\) east of south.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Let \(\vec R\) be the resultant of the wind and river velocities,
that is 
\[ \vec R = -$rvrspd\, \vec i +
	($wndspd\cos(\frac{\pi}{4})\,\vec i +
	$wndspd\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})\,\vec j).
\]
The \(x\) component of this is approximately $dr km/hr in the $pos \(x\)
direction, which the rower's velocity in the \(x\) direction must cancel.
Thus the rower should row at an angle of
\[ t_1 \approx \sin^{-1}($dr/$rowspd) \approx $ang2^{\circ} \]
\{ $dir2->correct_ans() \} of south.
$PAR
Then, the \(y\) component of the rower's velocity is
\( v_y = \sqrt{ $rowspdsq - $dr^2 } \approx $resr. \)
This is $grlt the component of the wind that is pushing
north, so the rower will get to $which
bank first$expl.
