BEGIN_TEXT

A cat, walking along the window ledge of a New York apartment,
knocks off a flower pot, which falls to the
street $h feet below.  How fast is the flower pot
traveling when it hits the street?
(Give your answer in ft/s and in mi/hr, given that
the acceleration due to gravity is \( 32 \ \mathrm{ft/s^2} \)
and 1 ft/s = 15/22 mi/hr.)

$PAR
speed in ft/s = \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
speed in mi/hr = \{ ans_rule(25) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The height of an object above the ground which begins at rest and
falls for \(t\) seconds is
\[
s(t) = -16 t^2 + K,
\]
where \(K\) is the initial height. Here the flower pot falls from
$h ft, so \(K = $h\).  To see when the pot hits the
ground, solve \(-16 t^2 + $h =0\).  The solution
is \(t_1 = \sqrt{$h/16} \approx $timpact\) sec.

$PAR
Now, velocity is given by \(s'(t) = v(t) = -32 t\).  So, the velocity
when the pot hits the ground is
\( v(t_1) = -32\sqrt{$h/16} \approx -$vimpact\) ft/s, so the
speed at impact is approximately $vimpact ft/s.  In miles per hour,
this is $vimpact2 mph downward.
