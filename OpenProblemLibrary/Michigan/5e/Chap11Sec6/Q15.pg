BEGIN_TEXT

According to a simple physiological model, an athletic adult male needs
20 calories per day per pound
of body weight to maintain his weight.
If he consumes more or fewer calories than those required to maintain
his weight, his weight changes at a
rate proportional to the difference between the number of calories
consumed and the number needed to maintain his current
weight; the constant of proportionality is
\( 1/3500 \) pounds per calorie. Suppose that a
particular person has a constant caloric intake of \( H \) calories per
day. Let \( W(t) \) be the person's weight in
pounds at time \( t \) (measured in days).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Since the rate of change of the weight is equal to
\[\frac{1}{3500}(\hbox{Intake }-\hbox{ Amount to maintain weight})\]
we have
\[\frac{dW}{dt}=\frac{1}{3500}(H - 20\,W).\]
$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Starting off with the equation
\[ \frac{dW}{dt}=-\frac{1}{175}
    \left(W-\frac{H}{20}\right),\]
we separate variables and integrate:
\[\int \frac{dW}{W-\frac{H}{20}}=
    -\int \frac{1}{175}\,dt.\]
Thus we have
\[ \ln\bigg|W-\frac{H}{20}\bigg|
    =-\frac{1}{175}t+C\]
so that
\[ W - \frac{H}{20} = A e^{-t/175} \]
or, in other words
\[ W = \frac{H}{20} + Ae^{-t/175}.\]
If the caloric intake is $calories calories per day we know that
\(H = $calories\).  Then, if the person initially weighs $weight
pounds, we have
\[ $weight = $calo20 + A, \]
so that \( A = $pmc20\).  Thus
\[ W = $calo20 + $pmc20\, e^{-t/175}. \]
$PAR

${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
From our solution in (b), we know that as \(t\to\infty\),
\(W\to $calo20\).  This is seen in the graph of weight vs.
time, shown below.
