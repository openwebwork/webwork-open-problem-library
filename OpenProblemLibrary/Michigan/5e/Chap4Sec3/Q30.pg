Find a formula for the fourth degree polynomial \(p(x)\) whose graph is
symmetric about the \( y \)-axis, and which has a
\( y \)-intercept of $y0, and global maxima at \( ($x1,$y1) \) and
\( (-$x1, $y1) \).

$PAR
\(p(x) = \) \{ $px->ans_rule(35) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Since the graph is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis, the polynomial must have
only even powers.  Also, since the \(y\)-intercept is $y0, the constant term
must be $y0.  Thus, the polynomial is of the form
\[ y = a x^4 + b x^2 $con. \]

$PAR
Differentiating gives
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = 4 a x^3 + 2 b x = x ( 4 a x^2 + 2 b ). \]
Thus \(dy/dx=0\) at \(x=0\) and when \(4ax^2+2b=0\).  Since the maxima
occur where \(x=\pm $x1\), we have \(4a($ratio) + 2 b = 0\), so
\(b=-$tworatio a\).

$PAR
We are given \(y=$y1\) when \(x=\pm $x1\), so using \(y=ax^4+bx^2 $con\) gives
\[ $ratiosqd a + $ratiod b $con = $y1, \]
so
\[ $ratiosqd a - $tworatiosq a $con = $y1, \]
and, solving for \(a\),
\( a = $a \), so that \( b = $b\).  Thus
\[ p(x) = $px. \]

$PAR
To see if the points \((\pm $x1,$y1)\) are local maxima, we take
the second derivative,
\[
\frac {d^2y}{dx^2}= $twelvea x^2 + $twob,
\]
which is negative if \(x=\pm $x1\).  The critical points at \(x=\pm $x1\) are
local maxima.  Since the leading coefficient of this polynomial is negative,
we know the graph decreases without bound as \(|x|\) approaches
\(\pm \infty\), so these critical points are also global maxima.  Note that
at \(x=0\) the second derivative is positive, so the point \((0,$y0)\) is a
local minimum.  There is no global minimum.
