To test convergence, we use the ratio test.
Since \(a_n=(n!)^{$a}/($a n)!\), replacing \(n\) by \(n+1\) gives
\(a_{n+1}=((n+1)!)^2/(2n+2)!\). Thus,
\[
 \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} =
   \frac{{\frac{((n+1)!)^{$a}}{($a n+ $a)!}} }
   {{ \frac{(n!)^{$a}}{($a n)!}}}
   =
   \frac{((n+1)!)^{$a}}{($a n+ $a)!} \cdot \frac{($a n)!}{(n!)^{$a}}.
\]
However, since \((n+1)!=(n+1)n!\) and
\(($a n+ $a)! =($a n+$a)$aterms($a n)!\), we have
\[
 \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|}=
 \frac{(n+1)^{$a} (n!)^{$a} ($a n)!}{($a n+$a)$aterms($a n)!(n!)^{$a}}
 =\frac{(n+1)^{$a}}{($a n+$a)$aterms},
 \]
and as \(n\to\infty\), we have
\[
L=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} = \frac{1}{$atoa}.
\]
Since \(L<1\), the ratio test tells us that the series converges.

$convSol[1] =<<eos;
To test convergence, we use the ratio test.
Since \(a_n=\frac{(-$b)^n}{(n!)}\), replacing \(n\) by \(n+1\) gives
\(a_{n+1}=\frac{(-$b)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\). Thus,
\[
 \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} =
   \frac{ \frac{($b)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} }
   { \frac{($b)^n}{(n!)} }
   =
   \frac{($b)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \cdot \frac{(n!)}{($b)^n}
   =
   \frac{$b}{n+1}.
\]
Thus, as \(n\to\infty\), we have
\[
L=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|} = 0.
\]
Since \(L<1\), the ratio test tells us that the series converges.

		          "convergence of this series." );
$expl[2] = "the terms in the series don't involve factorials or " .
    "exponentials, so we don't expect the ratio test to be the best " .
    "choice, and the ratio is in fact one, so we can't use it.  We can " .
    "use any of the integral, comparison or limit comparison tests, " .
    "however.  The alternating series test doesn't apply because the " .
    "terms in the series do not alternate sign.";
$convSol[2] =<<eos;
To test convergence, we use the limit comparison test.  We know that
\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}\) converges.  Consider the
limit
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{ \frac{1}{n^2} }{ \frac{1}{n^2 - $c} }
   = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{ n^2 - $c }{ n^2 } =
   = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{ 1 - \frac{$c}{n^2} }{ 1 } = 1. \]
This is a finite limit, so we know that both series have the same
convergence properties, and therefore that the series that we are testing
must converge.
