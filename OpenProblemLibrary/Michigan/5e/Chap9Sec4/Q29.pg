$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Note that for both of these series the terms alternate in sign, and
the magnitudes of successive terms decrease, so that we are able to
apply the alternating series test.

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
For \(\sum\limits_{n=$ser[$which[0]]->[1]}^{\infty} $ser[$which[0]]->[0]\),
we have \(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} $ser[$which[0]]->[3] =
