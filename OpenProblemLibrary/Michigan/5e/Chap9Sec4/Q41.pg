$convSol[0] =<<eos;
To test convergence, we use the limit comparison test.  We compare
with
\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{$c^n}{$b^n} =
  \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{$c}{$b}\right)^n\), which is
a divergent geometric series.  Then
\[
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = 
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{\frac{$c^n}{$b^n - 1}}{\frac{$c^n}{$b^n}} =
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{$c^n}{$b^n - 1}\cdot \frac{$b^n}{$c^n} =
\]
\[
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{$b^n}{$b^n - 1} =
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{1 - (1/$b^n)} = 1.
\]
Since the limit is bounded, the limit comparison test tells us that
the two series have the same convergence properties, and so our series
must diverge.

$convSol[1] =<<eos;
To test convergence, we use the limit comparison test.  We compare
with \(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\), which we know diverges.
Then
\[
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} =
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{\frac{\ln($b n) + $c n}{n^2}}{\frac{1}{n}} =
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{\ln($b n) + $c n}{n}.
\]
Then we know that any power of \(n\) dominates the \(\ln($b n)\) term,
so we have
\[
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{\ln($b n) + $c n}{n} = 0 + $c.
\]
Thus the two series have the same convergence properties, and so our series
must diverge.

$expl[2] = "the terms alternate in sign from positive to negative, so " .
    "only the ratio or alternating series test will work.  The ratio test " .
    "has a limit of one, so it does not determine convergence.  The " .
    "alternating series test will, however, work.";
$convSol[2] =<<eos;
To test convergence, we use the alternating series test.  We know that
\(\cos(n\pi)\) alternates sign, so the series is alternating.  For large
enough \(n\), we can see that \(|\frac{(n$rm1e - $c)\cos(n\pi)}{n^{$r}}|\)
is monotonically decreasing, so the test is applicable.  Then, we have
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} |\frac{(n$rm1e - $c)\cos(n\pi)}{n^{$r}}| =
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{(n$rm1e - $c)}{n^{$r}} =
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{(1 - ($c/n))}{n} = 0.
\]
Thus the limit goes to zero, and we know by the alternating series test
that the series must converge.
