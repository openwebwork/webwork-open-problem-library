BEGIN_TEXT

At $hour1:00 pm one winter afternoon, there is a power
failure at your house in Wisconsin, and  your heat does not work
without electricity.  When the power goes out, it is
\( $temp1^{\circ}\)F in your
house.  At $hour2:00 pm, it is \( $temp2^{\circ} \)F
in the house, and you notice
that it is \( $outtemp^{\circ} \)F outside.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Assuming that the temperature, \( T \), in your home obeys Newton's Law
of Cooling, write the differential equation satisfied by \( T \).

${BITALIC}(Use ${BBOLD}k$EBOLD for any constant of proportionality in

$PAR

Solve the differential equation to estimate the temperature in the
house when you get up at $hour3:00 am the next morning.

Think about your equation in (a): what assumption did you make
about the temperature outside?  Given this (probably incorrect)
assumption, would you revise your estimate up or down?  (And why?)

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The differential equation is
\[ {dT\over dt} = -k(T - $outtemp),\]
where \($outtemp^{\circ}\)F is the outside temperature.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Integrating both sides yields
\[ \int{dT\over T - $outtemp} =-\int k\, dt.\]
Then \(\ln |T - $outtemp| = -kt +C\), so \(T= $outtemp +Be^{-kt}\).
We know that initially \(T=$temp1^{\circ}\)F. Thus,
letting \(t=0\) correspond to $hour1 pm, we get
\[ $temp1 = $outtemp C e^{0}, \quad\mbox{ so }\quad
   C = $t1mo. \]
Thus
\[ T= $outtemp + $t1mo e^{-kt}.\]
Since $hour2:00 pm corresponds to \(t=$delta\),
\[ $temp2 = $outtemp + $t1mo e^{-$delta k},\]
so
\[ $t2mo = $t1mo e^{-$delta k}, \]
and dividing by $t1mo and taking the natural log of both sides
we have
\[ k = -\frac{1}{$delta}\, \ln(\frac{$t2mo}{$t1mo}) \approx $k. \]

$PAR
At $hour3:00 the next morning (\(t=$del2\)) we have
\[
T \approx $outtemp + $t1mo e^{$del2(-k)} = $endtemp.
\]
so the pipes won't freeze.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
We assumed that the temperature outside the house stayed
constant at \($outtemp^\circ\)F.
This is probably incorrect because the
temperature was most likely warmer during the day
and colder overnight.  Thus, when the
temperature in the house dropped from
\($temp1^\circ\)F to \($temp2^{\circ}\)F,
the outside temperature was probably
higher than \($outtemp^{\circ}\)F,
which changes our calculation of the value of
the constant \(k\).  The house temperature will most certainly be lower
than \($endtemp^{\circ}\)F
at $hour3 am, but not by much---not enough to freeze.
