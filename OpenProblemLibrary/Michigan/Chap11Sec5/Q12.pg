BEGIN_TEXT

Warfarin is a drug used as an anticoagulant. After administration of
the drug is stopped, the quantity remaining in a patient's body
decreases at a rate proportional to the quantity remaining. Suppose
that the half-life of warfarin in the body is $h hours.
$PAR
Sketch the quantity, \(Q\), of warfarin in a patient's
body as a function of the time, \(t\) (in hours), since stopping
administration of the drug.  Mark $h hours on your graph.

$PAR
Write a differential equation satisfied by \( Q \):
$BR
\( {dQ\over dt} = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Your equation should not involve any undetermined
constants.)$EITALIC

$PAR
How many days does it take for the drug level in the body to be
reduced to $p percent of its original level?
$BR
time = \{ ans_rule(25) \}
(include \{ helpLink("units") \})

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

A graph of the amount of Warfarin in the body is given below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image(insertGraph($solgr), tex_size=>350, height=>150, width=>250,
         extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of a decaying exponential ' .
         'reaching half of its initial value at ' . $h . ' hours"') \}
$ECENTER
$PAR

Since the rate at which the drug decreases in value is proportional to
the amount in the system, we know that \(Q' = -k Q\), so that
\(Q = Q_0\, e^{-kt}\).  Since it takes $h hours to reach half of
the initial amount in the body, we have
\(0.5 = e^{-k($h)}\), so that
\[ k = -\frac{\ln(1/2)}{$h}. \]
Therefore the differential equation satisfied by \(Q\) is
\[ \frac{dQ}{dt} = -\frac{\ln(1/2)}{$h}\, Q.\]
Then we know that the drug reaches $p percent of its initial value
when
\($pdec = e^{-k t}\), so that
\[ t = \frac{$h\ln($pdec)}{\ln(1/2)}\hbox{ hr} \approx $t. \]
