BEGIN_TEXT

Hydrocodone bitartrate is used as a cough suppressant.  After the drug
is fully absorbed, the quantity of drug in the body decreases at a
rate proportional to the amount left in the body, with constant of
proportionality \(k\).  Suppose that the half-life of hydrocodone
bitartrate in the body is $h hours, and that the oral dose taken
is $d mg.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Write a differential equation for the quantity, \( Q \),
of hydrocodone bitartrate in the body at time \( t \),
in hours, since the drug was fully absorbed.
$BR
\( Q' = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Write your answer in terms of \(Q\) and \(t\), e.g.,
\(Q' = 3 t(1 - k Q)\).)$EITALIC

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Solve your differential equation, assuming that at \(t=0\) the
patient has just absorbed the full $d mg dose of the drug.
$BR
\( Q = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Your solution may include the constant of proporationality
\(k\), but should not include any other unspecified constant.)$EITALIC

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Use the half-life to find the constant of proportionality, \( k \).
$BR
\( k = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
How much of the $d mg dose is still in the body after 12
hours?
$BR
Amount = \{ ans_rule(25) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Since we are told that the rate at which the quantity of the drug
decreases is proportional to the amount of the drug left in the body,
we know the differential equation modeling this situation is
\[ \frac{dQ}{dt} = kQ. \]
Since we are told that the quantity of the drug is decreasing, we know
that \(k<0\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
We know that the general solution to the differential equation
\(\frac{dQ}{dt}=kQ\)
is \( Q=Ce^{kt}\).
Because we know that the initial amount of the drug in the body is
$d mg, \(C\) must be $d, and
\[ Q = $d e^{kt}. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
We are told that the half life of the drug is  $h hours. This means
that at \(t=$h\), the amount of the drug in the body is half the amount
that was in the body at \(t=0\), or, in other words,
\[ 0.5 Q(0) = Q($h).\]
Solving this equation gives
\[ 0.5 ($d) = $d e^{$h k},\quad\hbox{or}\quad
  k = \frac{\ln(0.5)}{$h}. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
From part (c) we know that the formula for \(Q\) is
\[ Q=$d e^{\ln(0.5) t/$h}.\]
Substituting \(t=12\), we get
\[ Q(12) = $d e^{12\ln(0.5)/$h} \approx $dval. \]
