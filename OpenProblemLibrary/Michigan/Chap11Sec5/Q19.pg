BEGIN_TEXT

Oil is pumped continuously from a well at a rate proportional to the
amount of oil left in the well.  Initially there were $k million
barrels of oil in the well;  six years later $k2d barrels
remain.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
At what rate was the amount of oil in the well decreasing when there
were $k3d barrels remaining?
$BR
rate = \{ ans_rule(25) \} barrels/year

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
When will there be $k4d barrels remaining?
$BR
after \{ ans_rule(15) \} years.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Suppose \(Y(t)\) is the quantity of oil in the well at time \(t\).  We
know that the oil in the well decreases at a rate  proportional to
\(Y(t)\), so
\[\frac{d Y}{d t}=-kY.\]
Integrating, and using the fact
that initially \(Y=Y_0=$k1\), we have
\[ Y=Y_0 e^{-kt}=$k1 e^{-kt}.\]
In six years, \(Y=$k2\), so
\[ $k2 = $k1 e^{-k\cdot6}\]
so
\[ 0.5 = e^{-6k},\quad\hbox{and}\quad
   k = -\frac{\ln 0.5}{6} \approx 0.1155.\]
When \( Y=$k3\),
\[\hbox{Rate at which oil is decreasing }=
  \bigg|\frac{d Y}{dt}\bigg| = kY =
  0.1155($k3)=$r1 \hbox{ barrels/year}.\]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
We solve the equation
\($k4 = $k1 e^{-0.1155t}\):
\[ 0.05 = e^{-0.1155t},\quad\hbox{so}\quad
   t = \frac{\ln 0.05}{-0.1155} = 25.9 \hbox{ years}.\]
