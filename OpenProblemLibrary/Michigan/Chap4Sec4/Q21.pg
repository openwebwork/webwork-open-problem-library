SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The average cost of producing \( q \) items is the total cost
divided by the number of items, so we have that
\( a(q) = \frac{C(q)}{q} \), and
\( C(q) = q\cdot a(q) = $a q^3 - $b q^2 + $c q \).

$PAR

Then the marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost, so
\( \hbox{MC}(q) = C'(q) = $threea q^2 - $twob q + $c \).  To find the
minimum marginal cost, we find its derivative and set it to zero.
\( \hbox{MC}'(q) = $sixa q - $twob = 0 \), gives
\( q = $mcmin_qval \).  We know this is a global minimum because
the marginal cost is an upward opening parabola.
Then the minimum value is just
\( \hbox{MC}($mcmin_qval) = $mcmin\).
The physical interpretation of the marginal
cost is that it is the increase in cost when an additional unit is
produced, so this is the minimum such increase.

$PAR

We minimize the average cost in the same way as before.
\( a'(q) = $twoa q - $b = 0 \) when \( q = $acqval \), at which
point \( a($acqval) = $ac_min \).  This is a global minimum
because \( a(q) \) is also an upward-opening parabola.

$PAR

Finally, plugging in, we get
\( \hbox{MC}($acqval) = $ac_min\).
We note that this is the same as the minimum average cost!
Analytically we can see that this must be the case by looking at
the definition of the average cost:
\( a(q) = \frac{C(q)}{q} \), so its minimum occurs when
\( a'(q) = \frac{C'(q)\cdot q - C(q)}{q^2} = 0 \), or, when
\( C'(q) = \frac{C(q)}{q} \).  That is, when the marginal cost, which is
equal to \( C'(q) \), is equal to the average cost.

$PAR

Another way to see why the marginal cost at \( q=$acqval \) must
equal the minimum average cost there is to view \( C'($acqval) \)
as the approximate cost of producing the ${acqval1}th or ${acqval}th
good.  If \(C'($acqval) < a($acqval)\),
then producing the next good
would lower the average cost, i.e. \(a($acqval2)<a($acqval)\).
If \(C'($acqval)>a($acqval)\), then producing the
next good would raise the average cost, i.e.
\( a($acqval)>a($acqval1)\).
Since \(a($acqval)\) is the global minimum, we must have
\(C'($acqval)=a($acqval)\).
