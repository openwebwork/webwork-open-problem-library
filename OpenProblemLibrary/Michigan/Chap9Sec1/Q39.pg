World oil consumption can be estimated to be approximately $consump
million barrels per day in $year and to be increasing at approximately
$perc percent per year.  Let \(c_n\) be the daily world oil
consumption (in millions of barrels per day) \(n\) years after $year.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
Because \(c_n\) is increasing at a percent per year, it must be
exponential.  Every year after $year the consumption is 
\(1 + $perc/100\) times what it was in the previous year, so 
\(c_n = $consump ($a)^n\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
Taking the difference \(c_n - c_{n-1}\), we get 
\[ c_n - c_{n-1} = $consump( $a^{n} - $a^{n-1} ) =
   ($consump)($a)^{n-1} ($a - 1) = ($consump)($a)^{n-1}($r). \]
This is the increase in daily oil consumption from year \($year + n - 1\) 
to year \($year + n\).
