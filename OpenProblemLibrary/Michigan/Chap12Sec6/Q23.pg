SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)-(d)$EBOLD
We have \(f(x,0)=0\) for all \(x\) and \(f(0,y)=0\) for all \(y\),
and obviously \(\lim\limits_{x\to0} f(x,0) = 0 = \lim\limits_{y\to0} f(0,y)\),
so these are both continuous (constant) functions of one variable.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(e)$EBOLD
Along \(y = x\), we have
\[ f(x,y) = f(x,x) = $ao2. \]
Because this is a constant value, this is a contour of \(f\).  Similarly,
along any ray \(y = m x\), we have
\[ f(x,y) = f(x, mx) = \frac{$a m}{m^2 + 1},\]
which is also a constant, and we therefore have that all such rays
are contours of the function \(f\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(f)$EBOLD
Finally, notice that because we know \(f(x,y) = $ao2\) along the
line \(y = x\), and \(f(x,0) = 0\), we can see that no matter how
close we are to the origin, we can find points \((x,y)\) where the
value \(f(x,y)\) is \($ao2\) and points \((x,y)\) where the value
\(f(x,y)\) is 0. So the limit \(\lim\limits_{(x,y)\to (0,0)}f(x,y)\)
does not exist.  Thus, \(f\) is not continuous at \((0,0)\), even though
the one-variable functions \(f(x,0)\) and \(f(0,y)\) are continuous at
\((0,0)\).
