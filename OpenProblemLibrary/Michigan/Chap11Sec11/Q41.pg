This problem concerns the electric circuit shown in the figure
below.

$ECENTER
$PAR
A charged capacitor connected to an inductor causes a current to flow
through the inductor until the capacitor is fully discharged. The current
in the inductor, in turn, charges up the capacitor until the capacitor is
fully charged again.  If \( Q(t) \) is the charge on the
capacitor at time \( t \), and \( I \) is the current, then
\[ I=\frac{dQ}{dt}. \]
$PAR
If the circuit resistance is zero, then the charge  \(Q\) and the
current  \(I\)  in the circuit satisfy the differential
equation
\[ L\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{Q}{C}=0, \]
where  \(C\)  is the capacitance and \(L\) is the inductance, so
\[ L\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2}+\frac{Q}{C}=0. \]
Then, just as as a spring can have a damping force which affects its motion,
so can a circuit; this is introduced by the resistor, so that if the
resistance of the resistor is \(R\),
\[ L\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + R\,\frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\,Q = 0. \]

If  \(L=1\)  henry,  \(R=$rd\)  ohm, and

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

In this case, the differential equation describing the charge is
\( Q'' + $rd Q' + {1\over $c} Q =0\), so the characteristic equation
is \(r^2 + $rd r + {1\over $c} =0\). This equation has one root,
\(r = -\frac1{$sqrtc}\), so the general solution for \(Q\) is
\[ Q(t) = (A + B t) e^{-t/$sqrtc}. \]
Note that
\[ Q'(t) = -\frac{1}{$sqrtc}( A + B t )e^{-t/$sqrtc} + B e^{-t/$sqrtc}. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
With \(Q(0) = 0\) and \(Q'(0) = $q0\), we have \(A = 0\) and \(B = $q0\),
so that \( Q(t) = $q0 t e^{-t/$sqrtc} \).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
With \(Q(0) = $q0\) and \(Q'(0) = 0\), we have \(A = $q0\) and
\(B = \frac{$q0}{$sqrtc}\), so that
\( Q(t) = ($q0 + $q0osqrtc t) e^{-t/$sqrtc}\).
