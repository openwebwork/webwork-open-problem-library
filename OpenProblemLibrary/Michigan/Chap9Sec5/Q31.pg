BEGIN_TEXT

The series \( \sum C_n(x + $center)^n \) converges at
\( x = $x1 \) and diverges at
\( x = $x0 \).

$PAR
Based on this information we know something about how big
and small the radius of convergence \(R\) of the power series
can be.  Between what two values must \(R\) lie?
$BR
\( R \in \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Give the possible values as an interval: thus, if \(R\) can
be greater than or equal to 3 but must be less than 8, enter
${BBOLD}[3,8)$EBOLD.  If there is no upper or lower bound for \(R\),
give the value as ${BBOLD}Inf$EBOLD or ${BBOLD}-Inf$EBOLD.)$EITALIC

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The series is centered at \(x=-$center\).  Since the series converges at
\(x=$x1\), which is a distance of $dx1 from \(x=-$center\), the radius of
convergence, \(R\), is at least $dx1.  Since the series diverges at
\(x=$x0\), which is a distance of $dx2 from \(x=-$center\), the radius of
convergence is no more than $dx2.  That is, \($dx1\le R\le $dx2\), or,
\( R \in [$dx1, $dx2]\).
