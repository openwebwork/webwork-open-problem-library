BEGIN_TEXT

In the following, find the vector representing the area of a surface.
The magnitude of the vector equals the magnitude of the area; the
direction is perpendicular to the surface.  Since there are two
perpendicular directions, we pick one by giving an orientation for the
surface.

The area vector \(\vec{A_1}\) for the rectangle with vertices
\( (0,0,0) \), \( ($p2[0],$p2[1],$p2[2]) \),
\( ($p3[0],$p3[1],$p3[2]) \), and \( ($p4[0],$p4[1],$p4[2]) \),
oriented so that it faces downward.

the \( $xz \)-plane, facing in the direction of the positive
\( $x \)-axis.

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
First let two adjoining sides of the rectangle be the vectors
\(\vec a\) and \(\vec b\): using the vectors from \((0,0,0)\)
to \( ($p2[0],$p2[1],$p2[2]) \) and from \((0,0,0)\) to
\( ($p4[0],$p4[1],$p4[2]) \), we have
\[ \vec a = $v1, \qquad \vec b = $v2. \]
Because the area of a rectangle is given by the cross product of
vectors along its sides, we can calculate an area vector as
\[ \vec a\times\vec b = $n0. \]
$n1msg

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The area vector for the circle must have magnitude
\(\pi r^2 = $rsq\,\pi \), and must point in the positive
\($x\)-direction, so
\( \vec{A_2} = $rsq\,\pi $ivec \).
