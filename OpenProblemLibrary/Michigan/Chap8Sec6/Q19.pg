The dairy industry is an example of cartel pricing: the government
has set milk prices artificially high.  Sketch a graph of a supply curve
(call it \(s\)) and a demand curve (call it \(d\)).  Label the
equilibrium price \(p^{*}\) and quantity \(q^{*}\).  Then label a price
\(p^{+}\) that is greater than \(p^{*}\).  Let \(q^{+}\) be the quantity
for which the demand curve passes through \(p^{+}\).
$PAR
Because it's hard to enter \(p^{*}\), \(p^{+}\), etc., in the homework
system, let's call the equilibrium price pstar, the equilibrium quantity
qstar, and similarly call the increased price pplus and corresponding
quantity qplus.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
On your graph, mark an area corresponding to the consumer surplus
when the price is pplus.  Express this area as an integral (which may
involve some of \(s\), \(d\), and the prices and quantities pstar, pplus,
qstar and qplus):
$BR
consumer surplus \( = \int_a^b\,\) \{ ans_rule(35) \} \(dq\), $BR
where \(a = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \} and
\(b = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Similarly, on your graph mark an area corresponding to the producer
surplus when the price is pplus.  Express this area as an integral
(which may also involve some of \(s\), \(d\), and the prices and
quantities pstar, pplus, qstar and qplus):
$BR
producer surplus \( = \int_a^b\,\) \{ ans_rule(35) \} \(dq\), $BR
where \(a = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \} and
\(b = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
$PAR

${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The total gains from trade are given by the sum
(Consumer surplus + Producer surplus).  How does this sum change
when the price is changed from \(p^{*}\) to \(p^{+}\)?

A graph of possible demand and supply curves for the milk industry is
given below (with the demand curve shown in red, and the supply curve
in blue), with the equilibrium price and quantity labeled \(p\mbox{*}\) and
\(q\mbox{*}\) respectively.

\{ image( insertGraph( $gr ), tex_size=>250, height=>250, width=>250,
          extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of supply and demand curves, ' .
          'with the equilibrium and a higher price marked."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Suppose that the price is fixed at the artificially high price
labeled p+ in the figure.  Recall that the consumer surplus is the
difference between the amount the consumers did pay (\(p\mbox{+}\)) and the
amount they would have been willing to pay (given on the demand
curve).  This is the area above the horizontal line \(p = p\mbox{+}\) and
below the demand curve \(d\).  Thus it is given by the integral
\[ \int_0^{q\mbox{+}}\,d - (p\mbox{+})\,dq. \]
Notice that this consumer surplus is clearly less than the consumer
surplus at the equilibrium price, which is the total area above
\(p = p\mbox{*}\) and below the demand curve \(d\).

$PAR
At the price \(p\mbox{+}\), the quantity sold, \(q\mbox{+}\), is less
than it would have been at the equilibrium price.  The producer surplus
is the area between \(p\mbox{+}\) and the supply curve ${BITALIC}at
this reduced demand$EITALIC.  This area is therefore given by
\[ \int_0^{q\mbox{+}}\,(p\mbox{+}) - s\,dq. \]
Compare this producer surplus (at the artificially high price) to the
producer surplus at the equilibrium price (which is the area between
\(p\mbox{*}\) and the supply curve).  It appears that in this case,
producer surplus is greater at the artificial price than at the
equilibrium price.  (Different supply and demand curves might have led
to a different answer.)

$PAR
The total gains from trade (Consumer surplus + Producer surplus) at
the artificially high price of \(p\mbox{+}\) is the total area between
the supply and demand curves for \(0 \le q \le q\mbox{+}\).  It is
clear that, under artificial price conditions, total gains from trade
go down. The total financial effect of the artificially high price on all
producers and consumers combined is a negative one.
