BEGIN_TEXT

An oil company discovered an oil reserve of $mil million
barrels. For time \( t > 0 \), in years, the company's extraction
plan is a linear declining function of time as follows:
\[
q (t) = a - b t,
\]
where  \(q(t)\)  is the rate of extraction of oil in millions of barrels per
year at time  \(t\)  and  \(b = $b\)  and  \(a = $a\) .
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
How long does it take to exhaust the entire reserve?
$BR
time = \{ ans_rule(35) \} years
$PAR

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The oil price is a constant  $oil dollars per barrel, the extraction
cost per barrel is a constant $ext dollars, and the market interest
rate is $r percent per year, compounded continuously.  What is the
present value of the company's profit?
$PAR
value = \{ ans_rule(35) \} millions of dollars

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Suppose the oil extracted over the time period \([0,M]\) is \(S\).
Since \(q(t)\) is the rate of oil extraction, we have:
\[
S = \int_0^M q(t) dt = \int_0^M (a - b t) dt =
    \int_{0}^{M} ($a - $b t)\,dt = $a\cdot M - \frac{$b}{2}\cdot M^2.
\]
To calculate the time at which the oil is exhausted, we
set \(S=$mil\) and solve for \(M\) to get \( M = $time \) years.
So the oil is exhausted in $time years.

$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Suppose \(p\) is the oil price, \(C\) is the extraction cost per
barrel, and \(r\)
is the interest rate. We have the present value of the profit as
\[
\mbox{Present value of profit } = \int_0^M (p - C) q(t) e^{-rt} dt
   = \int_0^{$time}\, ($oil - $ext) ($a - $b t) e^{-$rd t}\,dt
   = $oodles \hbox{ million dollars}.
\]
