## (1): exponential growth, then decay

## (2): constant, then linear drop

## (3): slow exponential decay

## (4): sinusoidal
$graphs[4] = init_graph(0,0,6.28,3.25,axes=>[0,0],size=>[150,150]);

## and one bonus one: (5): exponential growth
$graphs[5] = init_graph(0,0,100,100,axes=>[0,0],size=>[150,150]);
$graphs[5]->lb('reset');
add_functions($graphs[5],"10*e^(0.02*x) for x in <0,100> using " .

## then pick five of the six graphs to show, and one of the descriptions
##    for each, and assemble a matching problem.
$match = new_match_list();

## we also keep track of which description we're using for each
@descrIndex = ();
for ( my $i=0; $i<6; $i++ ) {
