## we graph five different behaviors, and then select a description

## (0): logistic

## (1): exponential growth, then decay

## (2): constant, then linear drop

## (3): slow exponential decay

## (4): sinusoidal

## and one bonus one: (5): exponential growth
$graphs[5] = init_graph(0,0,100,100,axes=>[0,0],size=>[150,150]);
