SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let's look at what each of the graphs tells us:
$PAR
${BBOLD}1.$EBOLD
If we get sick upon eating too many pizzas or drinking
too much cola, then we expect our happiness to decrease once
either or both of those quantities grows past some optimum value.
This is depicted in graph (1) which increases along both axes until a
peak is reached, and then decreases along both axes.


$PAR
${BBOLD}2.$EBOLD
If we do get sick eating too much pizza, but are always able
to drink more cola, then we expect our happiness to
decrease after we eat some optimum amount of pizza, but continue to
increase as we get more cola.  This is shown by this figure, which
increases continuously along the cola axis but, after reaching a
maximum, begins to decrease along the pizza axis.

$PAR
${BBOLD}3.$EBOLD
If we do get sick after too much cola, but are always able
to eat more pizza, then we expect our happiness to
decrease after we drink some optimum amount of cola, but continue to
increase as we get more pizza.  This is shown by graph (3) which
increases continuously along the pizza axis but, after reaching a
maximum, begins to decrease along the cola axis.

$PAR
${BBOLD}4.$EBOLD
If we have iron stomachs and can consume cola and pizza endlessly
without ill effects, then we expect our happiness to increase without
bound as we get more cola and pizza.  This is what is shown in this
graph, since happiness increases along both the pizza and cola axes
throughout.

$PAR
Thus, our first answer is \{ $pop1->correct_ans() \}, and the second
is \{ $pop2->correct_ans() \}.
