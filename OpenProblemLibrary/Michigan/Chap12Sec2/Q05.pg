On a piece of paper, sketch each of the following surfaces:
$PAR
${BBOLD}(i)$EBOLD
\{ $eq[$which[0]]->[0] \}
$PAR
${BBOLD}(ii)$EBOLD
\{ $eq[$which[1]]->[0] \}

$PAR
Use your graphs to fill in the following descriptions of
cross-sections of the surfaces.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
For ${BBOLD}(i)$EBOLD
(\{ $eq[$which[0]]->[0] \}):
$BR
Cross sections with \(x\) fixed give \{ $x1->menu() \}
$BR
Cross sections with \(y\) fixed give \{ $y1->menu() \}
$BR
Cross sections with \(z\) fixed give \{ $z1->menu() \}
$PAR

For ${BBOLD}(ii)$EBOLD
(\{ $eq[$which[1]]->[0] \}):
$BR
Cross sections with \(x\) fixed give \{ $x2->menu() \}
