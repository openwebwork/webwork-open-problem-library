A student is speeding down Route 11 in his fancy red Porsche when his
radar system warns him of an obstacle 400 feet ahead.  He immediately
applies the brakes, starts to slow down, and spots a skunk in the road
directly ahead of him.  The "black box" in the Porsche records the car's
speed every two seconds, producing the following table.  The speed
decreases throughout the 10 seconds it takes to stop, although not
necessarily at a uniform rate.

$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ begintable(7) \}
\{ row( "Time since brakes applied (sec)", 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ) \}
\{ row( "Speed (ft/sec)", @vdata ) \}
\{ endtable() \}

What is your best estimate of the total distance the student's car traveled
before coming to rest (note that the best estimate is probably not the
over or under estimate that you can most easily find)?

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Because the speed data is always decreasing, we know that the left-hand
sum will be an overestimate, and the right-hand sum an underestimate.  We
therefore expect that the average of the two will be the most accurate
estimate we can get.  This is, writing speed\(= v\),
\[
\mbox{left-hand sum} = 2 (v(0) + v(2) + v(4) + v(6) + v(8)),
\]
or
\[
\mbox{left-hand sum} = 
  2 ($vdata[0] + $vdata[1] + $vdata[2] + $vdata[3] + $vdata[4])
  = $over, 
\]
and 
\[
\mbox{right-hand sum} = 2 (v(2) + v(4) + v(6) + v(8) + v(10)),
\]
or
\[
\mbox{right-hand sum} = 
  2 ($vdata[1] + $vdata[2] + $vdata[3] + $vdata[4] + $vdata[5])
  = $under.
\]
Thus we estimate that the distance traveled is 
\[
\mbox{distance} = \frac12 ($over + $under) = $dist.
\]

$PAR
Using the overestimate and underestimate for the distance traveled, we can
answer the last question.
