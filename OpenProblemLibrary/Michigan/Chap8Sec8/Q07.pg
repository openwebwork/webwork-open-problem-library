BEGIN_TEXT

Consider a group of people who have received treatment for a
disease such as cancer.  Let \( t \) be the
${BITALIC}survival time$EITALIC, the
number of years a person lives after receiving treatment.
The density function giving the distribution of \( t \) is
\( p(t)=Ce^{-Ct} \) for some positive constant \( C \), and the
cumulative distribution function is
\( P(t)=\int_0^t p(x)\,dx \).  Think carefully about what the
practical meaning of \( P(t) \) is, being sure that you can put
it into words.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The survival function, \(S(t)\), is the probability that a
randomly selected person survives for at least \(t\) years.
Find a formula for \(S(t)\).
$BR
\( S(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Suppose that a patient has a $p percent chance of surviving
at least $t years.  Find \(C\).
$BR
\( C = \) \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Using the value of \(C\) you found in (b), find each of the
following:
$BR
the probability that the patient survives up to (that is,
less than or equal to) $t1 years:
\{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
the mean survival time for patients with this survival 
function, in years:
\{ ans_rule(15) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The cumulative distribution function
\(P(t)=\int_0^t p(x)\, dx = \) Area under graph of density function
\(p(x)\) for \(0 \le x \le t\) gives the fraction of the population
who survive \(t\) years or less after treatment.  We could also say
that this is the fraction of the population who survive up to \(t\)
years after treatment.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The probability that a randomly selected person survives for at least
\(t\) years is the probability that she or he lives \(t\) years or
longer, so 
\[S(t) = \int_t^{\infty}p(x)\,dx =
    \lim\limits_{b\to\infty} \int_t^b\,C e^{-Cx}\,dx =
    \lim\limits_{b\to\infty} -e^{-Cb} + e^{-Ct} = e^{-Ct}.\]
Note that this is the same as \(S(t) = 1 - P(t)\).
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The probability of surviving at least $t years is
\[ S($t) = e^{-$t C} = {$p\over 100}. \]
Thus \(C = -{1\over $t}\ln($d)\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The probability that a patient survives up to $t1 years is just
\(P($t1) = \int_0^{$t1}p(x)\,dx = e^{-C x}\bigg|_0^{$t1} \approx $sprob\).
$PAR
The average survival time for patients with this survival function
is
\[ \int_0^{\infty} x\cdot p(x)\,dx =
    \lim_{b\to\infty} C({-(1 + Cx) e^{-Cx}\over C^2}\bigg|_0^b =
    \lim_{b\to\infty} {-(1 + Cb)e^{-Cb}\over C} + {1\over C} = {1\over C}.\]
Thus the average survival time is \(T = -{$t\over\ln($d)} \approx $mean\).
