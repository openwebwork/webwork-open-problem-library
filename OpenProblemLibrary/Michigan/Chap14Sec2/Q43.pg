BEGIN_TEXT

A one-meter long bar is heated unevenly, with temperature in
\( {}^\circ \)C at a distance \( x \) meters from one end at
time \( t \) given by
\[ H(x,t) = $h \]
\(0\le x\le 1\).  On a sheet of paper, sketch a graph of
\(H\) against \(x\) for \(t=0\) and \(t=1\).  Think about why
your graphs make sense.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Substituting \(t=0\) and \(t=1\) into the formula for \(H\) gives:
\[
H(x,0) = $ht0,
\]
and
\[
H(x,1) = $ht1.
\]
The graphs of these are shown below (with \(H(x,0)\) in red and
\(H(x,1)\) in blue).

Note that this makes sense: it says that the bar starts with a varying
temperature distribution, and that as time goes on the temperature
decays at all points on the bar towards a temperature of zero.

To calculate \(H_x(x,t)\), we hold \(t\) constant and differentiate with
respect to \(x\):
\[
H_x(x,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}H(x,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
 $h = $hx.
\]
Thus
\[ H_x($x0,t) = $a\pi e^{-$r t}\cos($x0 \pi) = $hx0\quad
    {}^\circ\hbox{C/meter}, \]
and
\[ H_x($x1,t) = $a\pi e^{-$r t}\cos($x1 \pi) = $hx1\quad
    {}^\circ\hbox{C/meter}. \]
The practical interpretation of these partial derivatives is the rate of
change in temperature at \(x=$x0\) and \(x=$x1\) as we increase the
distance from the end \(x=0\).  Notice that \(e^{-$r t}\) is positive for
all \(t\). Given the formula for \(H(x,t)\), we see
that the closer the position to the center of the rod, the hotter the
temperature.  The partial derivative \(H_x($x0,t)\) has a positive sign
because, at \(x=$x0\) as we increase \(x\), we get closer to the center of
the rod, which is hottest.  The partial derivative \(H_x($x1,t)\) has a
negative sign because, at \(x=$x1\), as we increase \(x\), we get further away
from the center of the rod which is hottest.
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
To calculate \(H_t(x,t)\), we hold \(x\) constant and differentiate
with respect to \(t\):
\[ \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial
    t}($h) = $ht\quad {}^\circ\hbox{C/second}.\]
For all \(t\), and for \(0<x<1\) (that is, for all \(t\) and all \(x\) inside
the rod), the partial derivative \(H_t(x,t)\) is negative. In terms of
heat, \(H_t(x,t)\) represents the rate at which the
temperature of the rod is changing as time passes at position
\(x\) and time \(t\). Thus, the temperature
inside the rod is always decreasing.
