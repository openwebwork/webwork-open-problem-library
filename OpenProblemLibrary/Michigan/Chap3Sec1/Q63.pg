SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
The average velocity between \(t = 0\) and \(t = $t0\) is given by
\[
\hbox{Avg velocity} = {{f($t0) - f(0)} \over {$t0 - 0}} =
\frac{-4.9($t0^2) + $v0($t0) + $h0 - $h0}{$t0-0} =
$ans1 \hbox{m/sec}.
 \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
Since \( f'(t) = -9.8t+$v0 \), we have
\[
\hbox{Instantaneous velocity} = f'($t0) = -9.8($t0)+$v0 = $ans2 \hbox{m/sec}.
 \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
Acceleration is given \( f''(t) = -9.8 \).  The acceleration at 
\(t = $t0 \) (and all other times) is the acceleration due to gravity,
which is \( -9.8 \hbox{m/s}^2 \). 

$PAR
${BBOLD}D.$EBOLD
We can use a graph of height against time to estimate the
maximum height of the tomato.  
Alternately, we can find the answer analytically. The maximum height
occurs when the velocity is zero and \( v(t) = -9.8t + $v0 = 0 \) when 
\( t = $t1a \) sec.  At this time the tomato is at a height of 
\( f($t1a) = $ans3a \) m.
The maximum height is $ans3a meters.

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
Again, we can use a graph of the height of the tomato to estimate when
it hits the ground.  Alternately, we can find the
answer analytically.  The tomato hits the ground when
\[ f(t)= -4.9t^2 + $v0 t + $h0 =0. \]
We solve for \( t \) using the quadratic formula:
\[ t = \frac{-$v0 \pm\sqrt{($v0)^2-4(-4.9)($h0)}}{2(-4.9)}, \]
the positive solution for which is t = $ans4a seconds.
