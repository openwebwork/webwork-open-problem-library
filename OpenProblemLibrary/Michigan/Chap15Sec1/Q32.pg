SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Note that we can expand \(f(x,y)\) to write
\(f(x,y) = $func1\).  Then,
setting the partial derivatives equal to 0, we have
\[
f_x(x,y) = $fx = 0,
\]
and
\[ 
f_y(x,y) = $fy = 0,
\]
so that one critical point is \((0,0)\).  Note that if
we solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) in the second equation, getting
\($fy1\), and plug into the first, we get \( $coef x^3 = 0\), which shows
that the only critical point is the origin.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Calculating \(D\) gives
\[
D=(f_{xx})(f_{yy})-(f_{xy})^2 = $disc.
\]
At \(x=0,y=0\), we have
\[
D(0,0)=0.
\]
Thus the second derivative test tells us nothing about the nature of
the critical point.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Since \(f(0,0)=0\), we sketch contours with values near 0.  The contour
\(f=0\) is given by
\[ $func = 0 \]
that is, the two parabolas
\[ y = $a x^2\quad\mbox{and}\quad y = -\frac1{$b}\,x^2. \]
We also sketch the contours \(f=1\) and \(f=-1\), getting the figure below.

	  'to the left and right, 1."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
Since there are values of the function which are both positive (above
\(f(0,0)\)) and negative (below \((f(0,0)\)), near the critical point
\((0,0)\), the origin is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum; it
is a saddle point.
