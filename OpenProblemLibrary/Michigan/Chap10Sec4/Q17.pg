In this problem, you will investigate the error in the
\( n^{\rm th} \)
degree Taylor approximation, \(P_n(x)\), to
\( $f \) about \( 0 \) for various values of \( n \).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Let \( E_1 = $f - P_1(x) = $f - ($p1) \).  Using a calculator or
computer, graph \( E_1 \)  for \( -0.1 \leq x \leq 0.1 \), and notice
what shape the graph is.  Then use the Error Bound for Taylor polynomials
to find a formula for the maximum error, as a function of \(x\),
in this case:
$BR
\( |E_1(x)| \le \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}.
$PAR
Graph the actual error \(|E_1(x)|\) and your error bound together to
see that the error is in fact below the maximum error bound (but close
to it).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Let \(E_2=$f -P_2(x) = $f - ($p2)\).  Choose a suitable range
and graph  \(E_2\)  for  \(-0.1\leq x \leq 0.1\) .  Again, notice what
shape the graph of \(E_2\) is.  Then use the Error Bound for Taylor
polynomials to find a formula for the maximum error, as a function
of \(x\), in this case:
$BR
\( |E_2(x)| \le \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}.
$PAR
Graph the actual error \(|E_2(x)|\) and your error bound together to
see that the error is in fact below the maximum error bound (but close
to it).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
In this case the graph of \( E_1 = $f - ($p1) \) looks like a
parabola, which makes sense because we know that the error bound for
Taylor polynomials gives \( E_1 \propto x^2 \).  In fact, because
\[ |E_1(x)| \le \frac{M}{(2)!}|x|^{2}, \]
where \(M\) is a good error bound for \(f''(x)\), and knowing that
\(|f''(x)| = $m1x \le $m1n\) on \( -0.1\le x\le 0.1\), we have
\[ |E_1(x)| \le $e1.\]
A graph of \( |E_1| = |$f - ($p1)| \) and \( $e1 \) is shown below.

In this case the graph of \( E_2 = $f - ($p2) \) looks like a cubic,
which makes sense because we know that the error bound for
Taylor polynomials gives \( E_2 \propto x^3 \).  As above, because
\[ |E_2(x)| \le \frac{M}{(3)!}|x|^{3}, \]
where \(M\) is a good error bound for \(f'''(x)\), and knowing that
\(|f'''(x)| = $m2x \le $m2n\) on \( -0.1\le x\le 0.1\), we have
\[ |E_2(x)| \le $e2.\]
A graph of \( |E_2| = |$f - ($p2)| \) and \( $e2 \) is shown below.
