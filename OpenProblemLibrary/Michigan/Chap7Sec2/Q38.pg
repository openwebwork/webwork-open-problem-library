substitution or integration by parts is more appropriate, or if
neither method is appropriate.  Do not evaluate the integrals.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

For each of these, we're looking to see if there is a good
substitution (we can take \(w\) to be the argument of a function,
etc., such that its derivative, \(dw = w'\,dx\), appears in the
integrand; or, if the function looks like one on which integration by
parts is good.  We see that:
$PAR
${BBOLD}1.$EBOLD
For $int[0]->[0], $int[0]->[1]->[0] is appropriate, because
$int[0]->[2]
$PAR
${BBOLD}2.$EBOLD
For $int[1]->[0], $int[1]->[1]->[0] is appropriate, because
$int[1]->[2]
$PAR

For $int[2]->[0], $int[2]->[1]->[0] is appropriate, because
$int[2]->[2]

For $int[3]->[0], $int[3]->[1]->[0] is appropriate, because
$int[3]->[2]
