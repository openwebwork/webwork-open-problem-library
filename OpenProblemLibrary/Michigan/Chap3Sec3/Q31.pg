BEGIN_SOLUTION

Using the product rule, we know that 
\( h'(x) = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x) \).
We use slope to compute the derivatives.  Since \( f(x) \) is linear on
the interval \( 0 < x < $x0 \), we compute the slope of the line to see
that \( f'(x) = $a \) on this interval.  Similarly, we compute the slope
on the interval \( $x0 < x < $dom \) to see that 
\( f'(x) = -$a \) there.  Since \( f(x) \) has a corner at 
\( x = $x0 \), we know that
\( f'($x0) \) does not exist. 
Similarly, \( g(x) \) is linear on the interval
shown, and we see that the slope of \( g(x) \) on this interval is 
$mg, so we have \( g'(x) = $mg \) on this interval.

$PAR
${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
We have 
\( h'(1) = f'(1) \cdot g(1) + f(1) \cdot g'(1) = $a\cdot $g1 +
$f1\cdot ($mg) = $hp1 \).

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
We would like to say
\( h'(2) = f'(2) \cdot g(2) + f(2) \cdot g'(2) \), but actually can't
apply the product rule here, because \( f(x) \) has a corner at 
\( x = 2 \), and is therefore not differentiable there.
$PAR
However, for these functions \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) the product rule
does apply for all points to the left and right of \(x=2\), and
because the two functions are piecewise linear we can see that for
\(x<2\),  \(h'(x) = $hp1\) and for \(x>2\), \(h'(x) = $hp3\).  
Thus \(h(x)\) has the same characteristic non-differentiability as
\(f(x)\) at \(x=2\), and we can say that \(h'(2)\) does not exist.

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
We have 
\( h'(3) = f'(3) \cdot g(3) + f(3) \cdot g'(3) = (-$a)\cdot $g3 + 
   $f3\cdot ($mg) = $hp3 \).
