BEGIN_TEXT

Coal gas is produced at a gasworks.  Pollutants in the gas are
removed by scrubbers, which become less and less efficient as time goes on. 
The following measurements, made at the start of each month, show
the rate at which pollutants are escaping (in tons/month) in the gas:

$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ begintable(8) \}
\{ row( 'Time (months)', 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ) \}
\{ row( 'Rate', @rate ) \}
\{ endtable() \}
$ECENTER
$PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
Make an overestimate and an underestimate of the total quantity of
pollutants that escape during the first month.
$BR
overestimate = \{ ans_rule(35) \} tons
$BR
underestimate = \{ ans_rule(35) \} tons

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
Make an overestimate and an underestimate of the total quantity of
pollutants that escape for the whole six months for which we have data.
$BR
overestimate = \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
underestimate = \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
How often would measurements have to be made to find an
overestimate and an underestimate (for the quantity of pollutants
that escaped) during the first six months which differ by
exactly 1 ton from each other?
$BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \} times a month.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
An overestimate is $rate[1] tons 
(\(= $rate[1]\mbox{ tons/month}\cdot 1\mbox{ month}\)).  An
underestimate is $rate[0] tons.
$PAR

${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
An overestimate is $over tons.  An underestimate is $under tons.  (The
overestimate is 
\( \int_0^6 \mbox{rate} dt \approx (1)($rate[1]) + (1)($rate[2]) +
(1)($rate[3]) + (1)($rate[4]) + (1)($rate[5]) + (1)($rate[6]) = $over\), 
and similarly the underesimate is 
\( \int_0^6 \mbox{rate} dt \approx (1)($rate[0]) + (1)($rate[1]) +
(1)($rate[2]) + (1)($rate[3]) + (1)($rate[4]) + (1)($rate[5]) = $under\).)

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
If measurements are made every \(\Delta t\) months, and the rate is given
by \(f(t)\), then the difference between the two estimates (which is
the maximum error in either estimate) is \(|f(6)-f(0)|\cdot\Delta t\).
So for this to be only 1 ton, \(($rate[6] - $rate[0])\cdot \Delta t =
1\), or \(\Delta t = 1/$freq\) months (that is, we sample one time
every \(\Delta t\) months).  So we want to measure $freq times a month
to get a difference between the over- and underestimates of only 1
ton.
