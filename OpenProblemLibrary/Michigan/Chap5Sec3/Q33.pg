Over the interval \([$avgLo, $avgHi]\), we can estimate the
area between the rate function and the \(x\)-axis by doing a
left- and right-hand sum and taking advantage of the fact that
the graph passes through easy-to-find points.  We get

\[ \hbox{left-sum} = $lSum, \]

(the factors of one come from the width of the boxes we're considering)
and

\[ \hbox{right-sum} = $rSum. \]

Thus the best estimate for the integral of the rate function
on this interval is probably

\[ \int_{$avgLo}^{$avgHi}\,f(x)\,dx \approx \frac{1}{2}($left + $right). \]

And the average value of the rate is therefore
\(\frac{1}{$avgHi - ($avgLo)}\) times this, or

\[ \hbox{average} = $avgRate. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
$BR
To find the total change in the population, we calculate
\[ \int_{-3}^{3}\,f(x)\,dx = \hbox{total change}. \]

Proceeding as in part (a), we can use left and right sums and average,
finding
\[ \hbox{total change} \approx $intT, \]
where the change is given in thousands of algae.
