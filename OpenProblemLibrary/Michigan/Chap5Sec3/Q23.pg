SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We can find the average values for parts (a) and (b) by calculating
the value of the integrals \( \int_0^2\,f(x)\,dx \) and
\( \int_0^2\,g(x)\,dx \) as the area under the curves and dividing
by the length of the interval, which is 2.  This gives us:
$PAR
\( \hbox{Average}(f) = $avgVals[0]\), and
$BR
\( \hbox{Average}(g) = $avgVals[1]\).
$PAR
However, when we find \( f(x)\cdot g(x)\), we find that the product
is everywhere zero!  \(g(x)\) is zero for \(0\le x\le 1\), so
\(f(x)\cdot g(x)\) is zero there, and \(g(x)\) is zero for 
\(1\le x\le 2\), so \(f(x)\cdot g(x)\) is zero there too.  Thus the
average value of the product is zero, and the average of the product
is not equal to the product of the averages!
