BEGIN_TEXT

If \($dvar\) is the rate of change of $dvarDescr in $dvarUnits and 
\($ivar\) is $ivarDescr in $ivarUnits, consider the integral
\[
  \int_{$a}^{$b}\, $dvar\, d$ivar.
\]
Be sure that you can explain in words the meaning of this integral.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The integral 
\( \int_{$a}^{$b}\,$dvar\,d$ivar\) represents the
total change in $dvarDescr $ivarChange; it is measured in
$cAns.
