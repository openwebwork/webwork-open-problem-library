BEGIN_TEXT

The design of boats is based on Archimedes' Principle, which states
that the buoyant force on an object in water is equal to the weight of
the water displaced.  Suppose you want to build a sailboat whose hull
is parabolic with cross section \( y=ax^2 \), where \( a \) is a constant.
Your boat will have length \( L \) and its maximum draft (the maximum
vertical depth of any point of the boat beneath the water line) will
be \( H \).  See the figure below.

Every cubic meter of water weighs \( 10^4 \) newtons.  What is the
maximum possible weight for your boat and cargo?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

From the description of the problem, we want to put \((x,y)\) origin
at the front vertex of the boat, with the \(y\)-axis pointing up along
the center of the parabolic cross-section of the boat.  Then the
curved sides of the boat are given by the parabola \(y = a x^2\), and
the top of the boat is \(y = H\).  
$PAR

To find the volume of the boat, we can divide the interior of the boat
into flat slices of thickness \(\Delta x\) or \(\Delta y\), either of
which have a rectangular cross-section and can be integrated.  Let's
do it with vertical slices of thickness \(\Delta x\).  Then, because
the boat is symmetric for \(x < 0\) and \(x > 0\), we can find the
volume of half the boat and double it to get the total volume.  The
total weight of boat and cargo will then be the volume times \(10^4\)
Newtons. 
$PAR

Our slices have a width \(\Delta x\) and height \(H - a x^2\).  The
range of \(x\)-values we want (for half of the boat) are \(x=0\) to
the \(x\)-value where  \(y = H\), \(x = \sqrt{H/a}\).  Then
\[
\hbox{Volume of slice } = (H - a x^2) L \Delta x,
\]
so that 
\[
\hbox{Half Volume of boat } = 
  \int_0^{\sqrt{H/a}} (H - a x^2) L\,dx = 
    L \int_0^{\sqrt{H/a}} (H - a x^2)\,dx = 
\]
\[
    L (H x - {a\over 3} x^3)\bigg|_0^{\sqrt{H/a}} = 
    {2 L H^{3/2}\over 3 a^{1/2}} \text{ cubic meters}.
\]
The total volume is therefore 
\( V = {4L H^{3/2}\over 3a^{1/2}} \), and the total possible weight of
the boat is 
\( W = (10^4) \left({4L H^{3/2}\over 3a^{1/2}}\right) \) newtons.

$PAR
If we had chosen to slice with horizontal slices of thickness 
\(\Delta y\), each slice would have 
\[
\hbox{Volume of slice } = (2 x L)\Delta y = 2 \sqrt{{y\over a}}\,L\,\Delta y,
\]
and therefore 
\[
\hbox{Volume of boat } = 
  \int_0^{H}\, 2L \left(\frac{y}{a}\right)^{1/2}\, dy = 
  {2 L\over a^{1/2}}\, \int_0^H y^{1/2}\,dy = 
  {4 L H^{3/2}\over 3a^{1/2}} \text{ cubic meters}.
\]
And, as we should expect, we obtain the same result.
