BEGIN_TEXT

We might think that a ball that is dropped from a height of $height
feet and rebounds to a height $frac of its previous height at each 
bounce keeps bouncing
forever since it takes infinitely many bounces.  This is not true!
We examine this idea in this problem.

$PAR
${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
Show that a ball dropped from a height \(h\) feet reaches the floor
in \({1\over4}\sqrt{h}\) seconds.  Then use this result to find the
time, in seconds, the ball has been bouncing when it hits the floor
for the first, second, third and fourth times:
$BR
time at first bounce = \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
time at second bounce = \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
time at third bounce = \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
time at fourth bounce = \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
How long, in seconds, has the ball been bouncing when it hits the
floor for the \(n\)th time (find a closed form expression)?
$BR
time at \(n\)th bounce = \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
What is the total time that the ball bounces for?
$BR
total time = \{ ans_rule(35) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
The acceleration due to gravity is \(g = 32 \hbox{ft/s}^2\), so that,
ignoring air resistance, the height through which the ball falls in
time \(t\) is \(h = {1\over 2}g t^2 = 16 t^2\).  Thus the time the ball
takes to fall a distance \(h\) is \(t = {1\over 4}\sqrt{h}\).

$PAR
Thus, when the ball hits the first time, it has fallen for 
\({1\over 4}\sqrt{$height}\) seconds.  When it bounces, it takes as
long to ascend to its maximum height as to fall back to the ground, so
the elapsed time when it hits the floor the second time is 
\({1\over 4}\sqrt{$height} + 2\cdot{1\over 4}\sqrt{($height)($frac_tex)}\).
Similarly, at the third time it hits the floor the time is 
\({1\over 4}\sqrt{$height} + {1\over 2}\sqrt{($height)($frac_tex)} + 
  {1\over 2}\sqrt{($height)($frac_tex)^2}\), and so forth.

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
Note that we can rewrite the expressions that we obtained above
slightly to see that they are just finite geometric series: for
example, at the fourth bounce the elapsed time is 
\[ 
  {1\over 4}\sqrt{$height} + {1\over 2}\sqrt{($height)($frac_tex)} + 
  {1\over 2}\sqrt{($height)($frac_tex)^2} + 
  {1\over 2}\sqrt{($height)($frac_tex)^3} = 
\]
\[ 
  {1\over 2}\sqrt{$height} ( 1 + (\sqrt{$frac_tex}) + 
    (\sqrt{$frac_tex})^2 + (\sqrt{$frac_tex})^3 ) - 
  {1\over 4}\sqrt{$height}.
\]
We subtract the factor of \({1\over 4}\sqrt{$height}\) because the
ball only falls before hitting the floor the first time.  Noting this,
we can write a general expression for the time fallen:
\[
  \hbox{time} = 
    {{1\over 2}\sqrt{$height}(1 - (\sqrt{$frac_tex})^{n})\over
    1 - \sqrt{$frac_tex}} - {1\over 4}\sqrt{$height}.
\]

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
As \(n\to\infty\) in the expression from ${BBOLD}B$EBOLD, we get the
sum of an infinite geometric series, 
\[
  \hbox{total time} = 
    {{1\over 2}\sqrt{$height}\over 1 - \sqrt{$frac_tex}} -
    {1\over 4}\sqrt{$height} \approx $tottime \hbox{ sec}.
\]
