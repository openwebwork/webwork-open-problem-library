BEGIN_TEXT

This problem shows how we can find the long-run amount of a drug
(e.g., ampicillin) in a patient's body without using a geometric
series.  Suppose that a patient takes a pill containing $q0 mg of
ampicillin every 6 hours, and that at the end of 6 hours $rperc
percent of the amount in the patient's body at the beginning of
the 6 hour period remains.  With \(Q_n\) giving the amount of
ampicillin in the patient's body after taking the nth pill, this
results in the amount of the drug in the patient's body being
given by the graph shown below.
$PAR
$BCENTER
\{ image( insertGraph($gr), height=>250, width=>250,
	  extra_html_tags=>'alt="graph of the quantity of drug ' .
          'in the patient for the first five six-hour periods."' ) \}
$ECENTER
$PAR
In the long run the ampicillin levels off to \(Q\) mg
right after each tablet is taken.  Six hours later, right
before the next dose, there will be less ampicillin in the body.
However, if stability has been reached, the amount of ampicillin
that has been excreted is exactly $q0 mg because taking one more tablet
raises the level back to \(Q\) mg.
$PAR
Write an equation involving \(Q\) that expresses this relationship.
$BR
\( $q0 = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
Solve your equation for \(Q\) to find the long-term maximum amount
of the drug in the patient's body.
$BR
\( Q = \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Since the amount of ampicillin excreted during the time interval between
tablets is $q0 mg, we have (Amount of ampicillin excreted) =
(Original quantity) - (Final quantity), or
\[
$q0 = Q-($r)Q.
\]
Solving for \(Q\) gives \(Q = \frac{$q0}{1 - $r} \approx $qI\).
