## solving this is ugly, because it involves solving a cubic no matter what
##    the initial point is picked to ensure that the resulting cubic has
##    three solutions
$x0 = 1;
$y0 = random(1,5,1);
$z0 = random(10,15,1);

## then the solution to the lagrange problem requires
##    2 (x - x0) = 2 L x,    (1)
##    2 (y - y0) = 2 L y,    (2)
##    2 (z - z0) = -L        (3)
## from (1) and (2), y = (y0/x0) x, and dividing (1) by (3) gives
##    z = z0 - (1 - x0/x)/2
## therefore, plugging into x^2 + y^2 - z = 0, we have
##    2(1 + (y0/x0)^2) x^3 - (2 z0 - 1) x - x0 = 0
## zeros of this have to be found numerically.  we have 25 possibilities
##    given our parameter choices; these are given in the @xvals array
##    (which saves us coding Newton's method to find a sufficiently
##    accurate answer)
## a guess for the middle zero is x = 0; one Newton iterate gives
$xzero = $x0/(1 - 2*$z0);
## for the values of x0, y0 and z0 we are using, this is within about
##    0.011% of the correct value

$min = 5000;   $minInd = 0;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Let \((x,y,z)\) be a point on the paraboloid.
The square of the distance from
\((x,y,z)\) to the point \(($x0,$y0,$z0)\) is given by
\[
  f(x,y,z) = (x-$x0)^2 + (y-$y0)^2 + (z-$z0)^2,
\]
and so we wish to minimize \(f(x,y,z)\) subject to the constraint
\[
  g(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2-z = 0.
\]
We look for solutions to the equations
\(\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g\) and \(g=0\):
\[ 2(x-$x0) = 2\lambda x, \]
\[ 2(y-$y0) = 2\lambda y, \]
\[ 2(z-$z0) = -\lambda, \]
and
\[ x^2+y^2-z = 0. \]
If \(\lambda=0\), the first three equations would imply that
\((x,y,z)=($x0,$y0,$z0)\), which does not satisfy the fourth
equation and so \(\lambda\ne 0\). If collect terms in \(x\) and
\(y\) in the first and second equations, respectively, we get
\[ (1 - \lambda) x = $x0, \]
and
\[ (1 - \lambda) y = $y0. \]
Note that we cannot have \(\lambda = 1\), \(x = 0\) or \(y = 0\),
and so can divide these two equation to solve for \(y\), getting
\[ y = $y0d x \].
$PAR
If we divide the first and third equations we got from the
Lagrange multipliers method, we have
\[ \frac{x - $x0}{z - $z0} = -2x, \]
so that
\[ z = $z0 - \frac12(1 - \frac{$x0}{x}). \]
$PAR
We can then plug all of these into the last equation, the constraint.
This gives
\[
  x^2 + $y0sqd x^2 - $z0 + \frac12(1 - \frac{$x0}{x}) = 0.
\]
Multiplying by \(x\) and collecting terms, we have
\[
  $a x^3 - $b x - $x0 = 0.
\]
Let \(h(x) = $a x^3 - $b x - $x0\).  Clearly
\(h(-3) < 0\), \(h(-\frac12) > 0\), \(h(0) < 0\) and \(h(3) > 0\).
Thus there must be roots lying between \(x = -3\) and \(x = -0.5\),
between \(x = -0.5\) and \(x = 0\), and between \(x = 0\) and
\(x = 3\).  We can locate these numerically using a calculator or
computer program, to find
\[ x = $xzeros[0], \quad x = $xzeros[1], \quad\mbox{and}\quad
   x = $xzeros[2]. \]
Then, using the equations for \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\), we
have the corresponding values of \(y\) and \(z\), and therefore
have three solutions to the Lagrange multiplier equations:
\[ x_1 = $xzeros[0], y_1 = $yzeros[0], z_1 = $zzeros[0], \]
\[ x_2 = $xzeros[1], y_2 = $yzeros[1], z_2 = $zzeros[1], \]
and
\[ x_3 = $xzeros[2], y_3 = $yzeros[2], z_3 = $zzeros[2]. \]
$PAR
The distances (squared) from the paraboloid are
\[ d_1 = d(x_1,y_1,z_1) = $dist[0], \]
\[ d_2 = d(x_2,y_2,z_2) = $dist[1], \]
and
\[ d_3 = d(x_3,y_3,z_3) = $dist[2], \]
so that the minimum distance is \( \sqrt{d_3} = $minDist \).

$PAR
Note that the geometric interpretation of this is that it is the
length of a perpendicular line segment drawn from the paraboloid
to the point.
