Write an expression involving the values of \(x\) and \(y = f(x)\)
marked on the graph that gives the slope of the line joining the
endpoints of the graph.
$BR
slope = \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
On a print-out of this problem, draw the tangent line to the curve at
the point \(($c, $cy)\).  How does the slope of this line compare with that
of your line in (a)?
$BR
slope of this tangent line \{ $pop->menu() \} slope of line from (a)

Give another point on the curve where the slope of the line is
approximately equal to the slope of your tangent line in (b).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
For the line between the endpoints, the slope is
\( m = \frac{y6 - y0}{x6 - x0} \).
$PAR

${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
By considering the graph of the function, the line between
\((x0,y0)\) and \((x6,y6)\), and the tangent line at \(($c,$cy)\),
we can see that the
slope of this tangent line \{ $pop->correct_ans() \} the slope of
the line between the endpoints.
$PAR

${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
Again by thinking about the slope of lines tangent to the curve,
we can see that the line tangent to the curve at \(x = $otherC\)
will be approximately the same as that at \(x = $c\).
