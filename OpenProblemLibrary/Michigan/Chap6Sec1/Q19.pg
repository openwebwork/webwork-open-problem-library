SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Between time \(t=0\) and the time \(t\) at point \(B\), the velocity
of the cork is always positive, which means the cork is moving upward.
At time that time the velocity is zero, and so the cork has stopped
moving altogether.
Since shortly thereafter the velocity of the cork becomes negative, and
the cork will next begin to move downward.  Thus when \(t=B\) the cork
has risen as far as it ever will, and is riding on top of the crest of
the wave.
$PAR
From time \(t=B\) to time \(t=D\), the velocity of the cork is negative,
which means it is falling.  When \(t=D\), the velocity is again zero,
and the cork has ceased to fall.  Thus when \(t=D\) the cork is riding
on the bottom of the trough of the wave.
$PAR
Since the cork is on the crest at time \(B\) and in the trough at time
\(D\), it is probably midway between crest and trough when the time is
midway between \(B\) and \(D\).  Thus at time \(t=C\) the cork is moving
through the equilibrium position on its way down. (The equilibrium
position is where the cork would be if the water were absolutely
calm.)  By symmetry, \(t=A\) is the time when the cork is moving through
the equilibrium position on the way up.
$PAR
Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity, points where the
acceleration is zero would be critical points of the velocity
function.  Since point \(A\) (a maximum) and point \(C\) (a minimum) are
critical points, the acceleration is zero there.
$PAR
A possible graph of the height of the cork is shown below.
The horizontal axis represents a height equal
to the average depth of the ocean at that point (the equilibrium
position of the cork).
