BEGIN_TEXT


In a certain chemical reaction, substance \( A \) combines with substance 
\( B \) to form substance \( Y \).  At the start of the reaction, the
quantity of \( A \) present is \( a \) grams, and the quantity of 
\( B \) present is \( b \) grams.  Assume \( a<b \) and \(y\le a\).
At time \( t \)
seconds after the start of the reaction, the quantity of \( Y \)
present is \( y \) grams.  For certain types of reactions, the rate of
the reaction, in grams/sec, is given by 

\[ \hbox{Rate}=k(a-y)(b-y), \]

where \(k\) is a positive constant.

Sketch a graph of the rate against \(y\).
For what values of \(y\) is the rate nonnegative?
$BR
${BITALIC}Give your answer as a union of intervals, e.g.,$EITALIC

$BR
\( y\in \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}2.$EBOLD
Use your graph to find the value of \(y\) at which the rate of the 
reaction is fastest.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}1.$EBOLD
If we expect the rate to be nonnegative, we must have \(0\le y\le a\)
and \(0\le y\le b\).  Since we assume \(a<b\), we restrict \(y\) to 
\(0\le y\le a\).

$PAR

In fact, the expression for the rate is nonnegative for \(y\) greater
than $b$, but these values of \(y\) are not meaningful for the
reaction.  See the figure below (which shows the rate with \(k=1\)).
$PAR
\{ image("figQ05.png", tex_size=>750) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}2.$EBOLD
From the graph, we see that the maximum rate occurs when \(y=0\); that
is, at the start of the reaction.
