A box has a bottom with one edge $a times as long as the other.  If
the box has no top and the volume is fixed at \( V \), what
dimensions minimize the surface area?

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

If one side of the bottom of the box has length \(x\), then the other
has length \($a x\), so, calling the height \(y\), we have 
\[ V = $a x^2 y. \]
$PAR
The surface area of the box, which is what we are minimizing, is 
\[ S = 2 x y + 2($a) x y + $a x^2 
     = (1 + $a) (2 x y) + $a x^2 = $a1 (2 x y) + $a x^2. \]
$PAR
Solving for \(y\) in the volume equation and substituting into the
equation for surface area, we get 
\[ S = \frac{2 ($a1) V}{$a x} + $a x^2. \]
$PAR
To find the dimensions which minimize the area, we find \(x\) such that
\(dS/dx =0\).
\[
\frac{dS}{dx} = -\frac{2 ($a1) V}{$a}\cdot x^{-2} + 2 ($a) x = 0,
\]
and solving for \(x\) gives \(x = ($a1 V)^{1/3}/$a^{2/3}\).  Then the other
two dimensions are \($a x = ($a1a V)^{1/3}\) and 
\(y = ($a V)^{1/3} / ($a1)^{2/3}\).
$PAR
To see that this gives a minimum, note that
for small \(x\), \(S\approx $twoa1 V/x\) is decreasing.  For large 
\(x\), \(S\approx $asq x^2\) is increasing.  Since there is only one
critical point, this must give a global minimum.
$PAR
We can also see this from the second derivative test:
\[
\frac{dS^2}{dx^2} = \frac{4 ($a1) V}{$a} x^{-3} + 2 ($asq) > 0,
\]
so \(S\) is always concave up and so the single critical point must be a
global minimum.
