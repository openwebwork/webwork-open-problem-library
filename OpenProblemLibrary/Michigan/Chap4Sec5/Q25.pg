SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The area of the rectangular part of the window is \( h w \), and the
area of the triangle is \( \frac12 w T = $halfa w^2 \).  Thus the
cross-sectional area, \(A\) is 
\[ A = h w + $halfa w^2. \]
$PAR
The perimeter of the window is \( P = w + 2 h + 2 d\), where \(d\) is
the length of the angled top edges of the triangle.  We can find \(d\) by
looking at half of the triangle and using the Pythagorean theorem: 
\( d = \sqrt{ (\frac12 w)^2 + T^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac14 w^2 + $a^2 w^2 }
     = \sqrt{ \frac14 + $a^2 } w \approx $b w\).  Thus
\[ P = w + 2h + 2($b) w = $twob1 w + 2h. \]
$PAR
From \( A = h w + $halfa w^2 \) we get
\( h = \frac{A}{w} - $halfa w\).
Thus,
\[
  P = \frac{2A}{w} - $a w + $twob1 w = \frac{2A}{w} + $c w.
\]
We now have the perimeter in terms of \(w\) and the constant \(A\).
Differentiating, we obtain
\[ 
  \frac{dP}{dw} = -\frac{2A}{w^2} + $c. 
\]
To find the critical points we set \(P'=0\) and solve for \(w\),
finding
\( w = \sqrt{2A/$c} \approx $c2 \sqrt{A}\).
Substituting this back into our expression for \(h\), we have
\( h = \frac{A}{$c2 \sqrt{A}} - \frac12 ($a) $c2 \sqrt{A}
     \approx $hc \sqrt{A}. \)
$PAR

Since \(P\to\infty\) as \(w\to 0^+\) and as \(w\to\infty\), this critical
point must be a global minimum.  We can also see this because it is
the only critical point and the second derivative,
\( P'' = 4A/w^3 > 0\), indicating that \(P\) is concave up.
