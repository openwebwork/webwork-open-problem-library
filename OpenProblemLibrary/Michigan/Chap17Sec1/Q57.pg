## pick things so that we get either a collision or a crossing, favoring
##    crossing
$isCro = random(0,5,1);
$isCol = $isCro ? 0 : 1;
$isCol = 1;
$intersect = PopUp( [ "?", "the paths cross, and the particles collide there",
		      "the paths of the particles cross, but with no collision",
		      "neither of these is true" ],
		    ( $isCol ? "the paths cross, and the particles collide there" :
		      "the paths of the particles cross, but with no collision" ) );

## then pick a first line
($x0, $y0, $z0) = ( non_zero_random(-5,5,1), non_zero_random(-5,5,1),
		    non_zero_random(-5,5,1) );
## and direction vector
($dx0, $dy0, $dz0) = ( non_zero_random(-3,3,1), non_zero_random(-3,3,1),
		       non_zero_random(-3,3,1) );

## then the first line is
$xl0 = FEQ( "$x0 + $dx0 t" );  $xl0 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$yl0 = FEQ( "$y0 + $dy0 t" );  $yl0 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$zl0 = FEQ( "$z0 + $dz0 t" );  $zl0 =~ s/1 t/t/;
## at t_1
$xl01 = FEQ( "$x0 + $dx0 t_1" );  $xl01 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$yl01 = FEQ( "$y0 + $dy0 t_1" );  $yl01 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$zl01 = FEQ( "$z0 + $dz0 t_1" );  $zl01 =~ s/1 t/t/;

## pick a t value for the collision or crossing
$t0 = non_zero_random(-5,5,1);
## if it's a crossing we need the parameter value for the other
##    parametric equation
$s0 = ( $isCol ) ? $t0 : $t0 + non_zero_random(-2,2,1);

## then pick the second line so that at $s0 the two are at the
##    same point.  the collision/crossing point is
$xc = $x0 + $dx0*$t0;
$yc = $y0 + $dy0*$t0;
$zc = $z0 + $dz0*$t0;
$pt = Point( $xc, $yc, $zc );

## so, with the direction vector
($dx1, $dy1, $dz1) = ( non_zero_random(-3,3,1), non_zero_random(-3,3,1),
		       non_zero_random(-3,3,1) );
$dx1 += ( $dx1 == -1 ) ? 2 : 1 if ( $dx1 == $dx0 );
$dy1 += ( $dy1 == -1 ) ? 2 : 1 if ( $dy1 == $dy0 );
$dz1 += ( $dz1 == -1 ) ? 2 : 1 if ( $dz1 == $dz0 );

## we have a point on the second line
$x1 = $xc - $dx1*$s0;
$y1 = $yc - $dy1*$s0;
$z1 = $zc - $dz1*$s0;

## the second line is
$xl1 = FEQ( "$x1 + $dx1 t" );  $xl1 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$yl1 = FEQ( "$y1 + $dy1 t" );  $yl1 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$zl1 = FEQ( "$z1 + $dz1 t" );  $zl1 =~ s/1 t/t/;
## at t_2
$xl12 = FEQ( "$x1 + $dx1 t_2" );  $xl12 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$yl12 = FEQ( "$y1 + $dy1 t_2" );  $yl12 =~ s/1 t/t/;
$zl12 = FEQ( "$z1 + $dz1 t_2" );  $zl12 =~ s/1 t/t/;

BEGIN_TEXT

Two particles are traveling through space. At time \( t \) the first
particle is at the point
 \[ ($xl0, $yl0, $zl0) \]
and the second particle is at
 \[ ($xl1, $yl1, $zl1) \]
$PAR

Describe the two paths in words.  Then determine if the two
particles collide, cross, or neither cross nor collide to fill
in the following.
$PAR

We see that
\{ $intersect->menu() \}.
$PAR

If they collide or their paths cross, indicate where
(if neither is true, enter ${BBOLD}none$EBOLD).
$BR
A collision or crossing occurs at
\( (x,y,z) = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}.

the two paths cross if there are times \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) such
that the position of the first particle at
time \(t_1\) is the same as the position of the second particle at time

Since the first equation is solved by \(t=$t1\), the second by
\(t=$t2\) and the third by \(t=$t3\), the particles do not
arrive at the same place at the same time, and so they do not
collide.

are there any times \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) such that the position of the
first particle at time \(t_1\) is the same as the position of the
second particle at time \(t_2\)?  If so, then
\[
$xl01 = $xl12, \quad
$yl01 = $yl12, \quad
$zl01 = $zl12
\]
We solve the first two equations and get \(t_1 = $t0\) and \(t_2 = $s0\).
This is a solution for the third equation as well, so the three equations
are satisfied by \(t_1 = $t0\) and \(t_2 = $s0\). At time
\(t = $t0\) the first particle is at the point \(($xc,$yc,$zc)\),
and at time \(t=$s0\) the second is at the same point.  The paths
cross at the point \(($xc,$yc,$zc)\).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Both paths are straight lines, the first passes through the point
\( ($x0,$y0,$z0)\)  in the direction of the
vector \($s01 $dx0d \vec i $s02 $dy0d \vec j $s03 $dz0d \vec k\)
and the second passes through
\(($x1,$y1,$z1)\) in the direction of
the vector 
\($s11 $dx1d \vec i $s12 $dy1d \vec j $s13 $dz1d \vec k\).
The two paths are not parallel.
$PAR

Is there a time \(t\) when the two particles are at the same place  at
the same time?  If so, then the particles collide, and their coordinates
will be the same.  Equating coordinates, we get
\[
$xl0 = $xl1, \quad $yl0 = $yl1,\quad $zl0 = $zl1.
