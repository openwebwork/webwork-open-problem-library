BEGIN_TEXT

The concentrations of two chemicals \( A \) and \( B \) as
functions of time are denoted by \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.
Each alone decays at a rate proportional to its concentration.
Put together, they also interact to form a third substance, at
a rate proportional to the product of their concentrations.  All
this is expressed in the equations:
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -$a x - x y, \qquad
   \frac{dy}{dt} = -$b y - x y. \]

$PAR
Note that \((x,y) = (0,0)\) is the only equilibrium state (both
concentrations must be positive or zero).

Note that one implication of your relationship should be that
if \(x\) and \(y\) are positive and very small (so that \(x\)
is very much smaller than \(\ln(x)\)), \(y^{$a}/x^{$b}\) is roughly
constant.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

An equilibrium state satisfies
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -$a x - x y = 0\quad\hbox{and}\quad
   \frac{dy}{dt} = -$b y - x y = 0.\]
Solving the first equation, we have
\(-x(y + $a) = 0\), so \(x = 0\) or \(y = -$a\).
The second equation has solutions
\(y = 0\) or \(x = -$b\).
Since \(x,y \geq 0\), the only equilibrium point is (0,0).
$PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
We have
\[\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} = \frac{dy}{dx} =
  \frac{-$b y - x y}{-$a x - x y} = \frac{y (x + $b)}{x(y + $a)} \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Thus,
\[\left(\frac{y + $a}{y}\right)dy = \left(\frac{x + $b}{x}\right)dx\]
so 
\[\int(1 + \frac{$a}y)\,dy = \int(1 + \frac{$b}x)\,dx.\]
So,
\[ y + $a\ln |y| = x + $b\ln |x| + C.\]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative,
\[ y + $a\ln y = x + $b\ln x + C.\]
This is as far as we can go with this equation---we
cannot solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), for example.
Given the initial conditions \(x(0) = $x0\) and \(y(0) = $y0\),
we can find \(C\), however:
\[ C = $y0 - $x0 + $a\ln($y0) - $b\ln($x0) = $c. \]
Thus an equation relating \(x\) and \(y\) is
\[ $yvsx. \]
We can see from this that if \(x\) and \(y\) are small, then
\( C \approx \ln(y^{$a}/x^{$b})\),
so the ratio \(\frac{y^{$a}}{x^{$b}}\) must be approximately constant.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
If \(x = y\), we can simplify the equation we obtained above to find
\[ C = \ln(x^{-1}), \]
so
\[ x = e^{-C} = e^{-$c} = $xy. \]
