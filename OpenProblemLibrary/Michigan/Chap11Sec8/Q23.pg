BEGIN_TEXT

The concentrations of two chemicals \( A \) and \( B \) as
functions of time are denoted by \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.
Each alone decays at a rate proportional to its concentration.
Put together, they also interact to form a third substance, at
a rate proportional to the product of their concentrations.  All
this is expressed in the equations:
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -$a x - x y, \qquad
   \frac{dy}{dt} = -$b y - x y. \]

$PAR
Note that \((x,y) = (0,0)\) is the only equilibrium state (both
concentrations must be positive or zero).

Solve your equation to obtain a relationship between \(x\) and \(y\).

$PAR
Note that one implication of your relationship should be that
if \(x\) and \(y\) are positive and very small (so that \(x\)
is very much smaller than \(\ln(x)\)), \(y^{$a}/x^{$b}\) is roughly
constant.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

An equilibrium state satisfies
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -$a x - x y = 0\quad\hbox{and}\quad
   \frac{dy}{dt} = -$b y - x y = 0.\]
Solving the first equation, we have
\(-x(y + $a) = 0\), so \(x = 0\) or \(y = -$a\).
The second equation has solutions
\(y = 0\) or \(x = -$b\).
Since \(x,y \geq 0\), the only equilibrium point is (0,0).
$PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
We have
\[\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} = \frac{dy}{dx} =
  \frac{-$b y - x y}{-$a x - x y} = \frac{y (x + $b)}{x(y + $a)} \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Thus,
\[\left(\frac{y + $a}{y}\right)dy = \left(\frac{x + $b}{x}\right)dx\]
so 
\[\int(1 + \frac{$a}y)\,dy = \int(1 + \frac{$b}x)\,dx.\]
So,
\[ y + $a\ln |y| = x + $b\ln |x| + C.\]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative,
\[ y + $a\ln y = x + $b\ln x + C.\]
This is as far as we can go with this equation---we
cannot solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), for example.
Given the initial conditions \(x(0) = $x0\) and \(y(0) = $y0\),
we can find \(C\), however:
\[ C = $y0 - $x0 + $a\ln($y0) - $b\ln($x0) = $c. \]
Thus an equation relating \(x\) and \(y\) is
\[ $yvsx. \]
We can see from this that if \(x\) and \(y\) are small, then
\( C \approx \ln(y^{$a}/x^{$b})\),
so the ratio \(\frac{y^{$a}}{x^{$b}}\) must be approximately constant.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
If \(x = y\), we can simplify the equation we obtained above to find
\[ C = \ln(x^{-1}), \]
so
\[ x = e^{-C} = e^{-$c} = $xy. \]
