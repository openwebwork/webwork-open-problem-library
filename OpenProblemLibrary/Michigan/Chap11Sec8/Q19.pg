BEGIN_TEXT

Consider a conflict between
two armies of \( x \) and \( y \) soldiers, respectively.
During World War I, F. W. Lanchester assumed that if both
armies are fighting a conventional battle within sight of one
another, the rate at which soldiers in one army are put out of action
(killed or wounded) is proportional to the amount of fire the other
army can concentrate on them, which is in turn proportional to the
number of soldiers in the opposing army.  Thus Lanchester assumed that if
there are no reinforcements and \( t \) represents time since the start
of the battle, then \( x \) and \( y \) obey the differential equations
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -ay, \qquad \frac{dy}{dt} = -bx, \]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants.

$PAR
Suppose that \(a = $a\) and \(b = $b\), and that the armies
start with \(x(0) = $x0\) and \(y(0) = $y0\) thousand soldiers.
(Use units of thousands of soldiers for both \(x\) and \(y\).)

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Rewrite the system of equations as an equation for \(y\) as a function
of \(x\):$BR
\( \frac{dy}{dx} = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Solve the differential equation you obtained in (a) to show that
the equation of the phase trajectory is
\[ $a y^2 - $b x^2 = C, \]
for some constant  \(C\) .  This equation is called ${BITALIC}Lanchester's
square law$EITALIC.
Given the initial conditions \(x(0) = $x0\) and \(y(0) = $y0\), what
is \(C\)?
$BR
\(C = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Thinking of \(y\) as a function of \(x\) and \(x\) as
a function of \(t\), then by the chain rule:
\(\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt}\), so:
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} = \frac{-bx}{-ay} = \frac{$b x}{$a y}.\]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Separating variables,
\[ \int $a y\,dy = \int $b x\,dx, \qquad\mbox{so}\qquad
   $a \frac{y^2}{2} = $b \frac{x^2}{2} + k. \]
Multiplying by 2 and letting \(C = 2k\),
\[ $a y^2 - $b x^2 = C. \]
Then, if we take \(x(0) = $x0\) and \(y(0) = $y0\), we can solve
for \(C\) to get \(C = $c\).
