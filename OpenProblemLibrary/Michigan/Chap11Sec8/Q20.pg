BEGIN_TEXT

For this problem we consider a conflict between
two armies of \( x \) and \( y \) soldiers, respectively.
During World War I, F. W. Lanchester assumed that if both
armies are fighting a conventional battle within sight of one
another, the rate at which soldiers in one army are put out of action
(killed or wounded) is proportional to the amount of fire the other
army can concentrate on them, which is in turn proportional to the
number of soldiers in the opposing army.  Thus Lanchester assumed that if
there are no reinforcements and \( t \) represents time since the start
of the battle, then \( x \) and \( y \) obey the differential equations
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = -ay, \qquad \frac{dy}{dt} = -bx, \]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants.

$PAR
Consider the case of a battle for which 
\(a = $a\) and \(b = $b\), and that the armies
start with \(x(0) = $x0\) and \(y(0) = $y0\) thousand soldiers.
(Use units of thousands of soldiers for both \(x\) and \(y\).)

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Using Lanchester's square law, \( $a y^2 - $b x^2 = C \),
find the equation of the trajectory describing this battle;
solve for the number of soldiers \(x\):
$BR
\( x = \) \{ ans_rule(55) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(You will need to solve for \(C\) using the initial
sizes of the armies.)$EITALIC

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Assuming that the army \(y\) fights without
surrendering until they have all been killed, how many soldiers
in army \(x\) does this model
predict would be left when the battle ended?
$BR
\( x = \) \{ ans_rule(55) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Lanchester's square law for this battle is
\[ $a y^2 - $b x^2 = C. \]
Solving for \(C\), we have
\( C = $c \).
Thus the equation of the trajectory is
\[ x = \sqrt{ \frac{$a y^2}{$b} - \frac{$c}{$b} }. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Assuming that the battle did not end until all of army \(y\) is
dead, the battle ends when \(y = 0\).  Plutting this into the
equation for \(x\), we have \(x = $xf\).
