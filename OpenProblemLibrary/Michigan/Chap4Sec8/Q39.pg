Two particles move in the \( xy \)-plane.  At time \( t \), the 
position of particle \( A \) is given by 
\( x(t) = $a t - $a \) and \( y(t) = $b t - k \), and the position
of particle \( B \) is given by \( x(t) = $c t \) and 
\( y(t) = t^2 - 2t - 1 \).

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
To determine if the particles collide, we check whether they are ever
at the same point at the same time.
We first set the two \(x\)-coordinates equal to each other:
\($a t - $a = $c t\), so that \(t = $a\).  Then, when \(t=$a\), we
need to determine if the \(y\)-coordinates are also equal.
\( y_A($a) = $ab - $k0 = $ya\), and 
\( y_B($a) = $a^2 - 2\cdot $a - 1 = $yb\).  These are not equal, so
the particles do not collide.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
For the particles to collide, we continue as in (a), but without the given
value of \(k\).  For the \(x\)-coordinates of the trajectories to be
the same we have the same condition as before, \(t = $a\).  Then, with
this value of \(t\), we get
\( y_A($a) = $b\cdot $a - k = $ab - k\), and
\( y_B($a) = $a^2 - 2\cdot $a - 1 = $yb\).  Setting these equal,
we get \(k = $k_col\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The speeds of the particles are given by \(s = \sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2}\).
For particle \(A\), the speed is \(s_A = \sqrt{$a^2 + $b^2} = $sa\).
For particle \(B\), the speed is \(s_B = \sqrt{$c^2 + 4(t - 1)^2}\).
Evaluating this latter at \(t = $t_col\), we find that $result.
