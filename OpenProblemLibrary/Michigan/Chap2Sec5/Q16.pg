Let \(P(t)\) represent the price of a share of stock of a corporation
at time \(t\).  What does each of the following statements tell us
about the signs of the first and second derivatives of \(P(t)\)?
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
$phrases1[$which1]
$BR
The first derivative of \(P(t)\) is \{ $deriv1->menu() \}
$BR
The second derivative of \(P(t)\) is \{ $sderiv1->menu() \}
