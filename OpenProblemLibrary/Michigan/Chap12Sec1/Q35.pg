BEGIN_TEXT

A rectangular solid lies with its length parallel to the
\( $a1 \)-axis, and its top and bottom faces parallel to the plane
\( z=0 \).  If the center of the object is at \( ($pt[0],$pt[1],$pt[2]) \)
and it has a length of $len, a height of $hei and a width of $wid, give the
coordinates of all eight corners:
$BR
coordinates = \{ ans_rule(75) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(Give your answer as a comma-separated list of points.)$EITALIC

$PAR
On a piece of paper, draw the figure labeling the eight corners.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The length corresponds to the \($a1\)-axis, therefore the
\($a1\)-coordinates of the corners must be \($l0\pm $l2\).
Similarly, the height corresponds to the \(z\)-axis, so that
the \(z\)-coordinates of the corners must be \($pt[2]\pm $h2\).
The width corresponds to the \($a2\)-axis, and thus the
\($a2\)-coordinates of the corners must be \($h0\pm $w2\).
$PAR
This gives the corners \($corners\).
