BEGIN_TEXT

A mass is oscillating on the end of a spring. The distance, \(y\), of
the mass from its equilibrium point is given by the formula
$BR 
\[ y=$a z \cos ($b \pi w t) \]
$BR 
where \(y\) is in centimeters, \(t\) is time in seconds, and \(z\) and
\(w\) are positive constants.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
What is the furthest distance of the mass from its equilibrium point?
$BR
distance = \{ans_rule(35)\} cm

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD 
How many oscillations are completed in 1 second?
$BR
number of oscillations = \{ans_rule(35)\}

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The furthest distance the mass can travel from its equillibrium point
is the amplitude \($a z\) of  the formula representing its motion.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
One complete cyclic is executed when
\[ $b \pi w t = 2\pi,\quad\mbox{so}\quad t=\frac2{$b w}. \]

$PAR
Therefore, the period is \(\frac{2}{$b w} = \frac1{$p w}\) seconds and
the number of complete oscillations that take place in 1 second
are \($p w\).
