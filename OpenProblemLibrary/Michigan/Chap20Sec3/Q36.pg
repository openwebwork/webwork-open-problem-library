${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
Using \(r=(x^2+y^2)^{1/2}\), we calculate
\(r_x = (1/2)(x^2+y^2)^{-1/2}2x\). Notice that
\(r_x = x/r\) and,
by a similar argument,  \(r_y = y/r\).  We have
\[
\mbox{curl}{\left(r^A\cdot(-y\vec i + x\vec j)\right)} =
\left|\matrix{\vec i&\vec j &\vec k \cr
{\partial\over \partial x}&{\partial\over \partial y}&{\partial\over
\partial z}\cr
-r^A y & r^A x & 0 }\right|
= \left({\partial (0)\over \partial y}-{\partial (r^Ax)\over \partial z}
\right)\vec i
\]
\[
+ \left({\partial (-r^Ay)\over \partial z} - {\partial
(0)\over \partial x} \right)\vec j
 + \left({\partial (r^Ax)\over \partial x} - {\partial (-r^Ay)\over
\partial y}   \right)\vec k
\]
\[
=0\vec i + 0\vec j + c \vec k = c\vec k
\]
where
\[
c = {\partial\over \partial x}(x r^A) -  {\partial\over
 \partial y}(-y r^A) = r^A + Axr^{A-1}r_x + r^A + Ayr^{A-1}r_y
\]
\[
=  2r^A + Ar^{A-1}(xr_x + yr_y)
\]
\[
= 2r^A + Ar^{A-1}\left({x^2\over r} + {y^2\over r}\right)
\]
\[
= 2r^A+Ar^{A-1}\left({x^2+y^2\over r}\right)
\]
\[
= 2r^A+Ar^{A-1}\left({r^2\over r}\right)
\]
\[ = (2+A)r^A. \]

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
The curl  is in the direction of \(-\vec k\) for \(A=$a1\),
and is in the direction of \(\vec k\)  for \(A=$a2\).
$PAR
Note that the curl is the circulation density, not the circulation.
If we graph the vector fields for \(A=$a1\) and \(A=$a2\), we can
see that the flow is counterclockwise in each case, indicating that
the circulation on any path around \(\vec k\) is positive even though
the circulation density may be positive or negative.  To understand
this, we must see how the
circulation around the \(\vec k\)-direction changes when the circles get
smaller and smaller. We need to  take into account the changing length
of the vector field as well as the changing direction.   This is too
subtle an effect to be measured accurately by eye.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
The curl has a component only in the \(\vec k\) direction.
Think of the this component as the limit of the circulation density
around a small circle in the \(xy\)-plane, as the circle shrinks to zero.
Thus the sign of the component of the curl tells us that
this circulation around the circle centered at \((1,1,1)\) is negative
for \(A=$a1\), and positive for \(A=$a2\). (This assumes
that the circle is small enough that it does not go around the origin,
where the vector fields are not defined.)  For \(A = -2\), the circulation
would be zero.

$PAR
Since the vector fields and their curls are not defined at
\((0,0,0)\), the curl calculated in part (b) does not tell us anything
about the circulation around a circle centered at \((0,0,0)\).
