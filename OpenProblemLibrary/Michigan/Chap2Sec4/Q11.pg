BEGIN_TEXT

A laboratory study investigating the relationship between
diet and weight in adult humans found that the weight of a subject,
\( W \), in pounds, was a function, \( W=f(c) \), of the
average number of Calories, \( c \), consumed by the subject in a day.

following conclusion: If Sam increases $his average calorie intake
from $c4 to $c5 calories per day, then $his weight will increase by
approximately $wdelta pounds.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR


Since \(W=f(c)\) where \(W\) is weight in pounds and \(c\)
is the number of Calories consumed per day:
$PAR
${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
\( f($c1) = $w1 \) means that consuming $c1 cal each day results in a
weight of $w1 lb (the units of $c1 are cal, and $w1 lb).
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
\( f'(2000)=0 \) means that consuming 2000 cal each day causes neither
weight gain nor loss (the units of the 2000 are cal, and 0 lb/cal).
$PAR
${BBOLD}(c)$EBOLD
\( f^{-1}($w2)=$c3 \) means that a weight of $w2 lb is caused by a
consumption of $c3 cal each day (the units of $w2 are lb, and $c3 cal).
$PAR
${BBOLD}(d)$EBOLD
The units of \(dW/dc\) are lb/cal
$PAR
${BBOLD}(e)$EBOLD
Based on Sam's conclusion,  \(f'($c4) \) should equal
\( \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta c} = \frac{$wdelta}{$cdelta} = $deriv\).
