BEGIN_TEXT

The temperature, \( H \), in degrees Celsius, of a cup of coffee
placed on the kitchen counter is given by \( H = f(t) \), where
\( t \) is in minutes since the coffee was put on the counter.

Is \( f'(t) \) positive or negative?

What are the units of \( f'($t) \)?

(see the \{ helpLink('units') \} cribsheet
for correct units notation)
$PAR
Suppose that \( |f'($t)| = $fp \) and \( f($t) = $f \).  Fill in the
blanks (including units where needed) and select the appropriate terms
to complete the following statement about the temperature of the coffee
in this case.
$BR
At \{ ans_rule(5) \} minutes after the coffee was put on the counter,
its \{ $temp->menu() \} is \{ ans_rule(10) \} and will \{ $inc->menu() \}
by about \{ ans_rule(10) \} in the next $dtsec seconds.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
As the cup of coffee cools, the temperature decreases, so
\(f'(t)\) is negative.

$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
Since \(f'(t) = dH/dt\), the units are degrees Celsius per
minute (degC/min).  The quantity \(f'($t)\) represents the rate
at which the coffee is cooling, in degrees per minute, $t minutes
after the cup is put on the counter.  Thus we can complete the statement:
$BR
At $t minutes after the coffee wa put on the counter, its temperature
is $f degC and will decrease by about $delf degC in the next $dtsec
seconds.
