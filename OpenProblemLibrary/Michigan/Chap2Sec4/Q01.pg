BEGIN_PGML
The temperature, [` H `], in degrees Celsius, of a hot cup of coffee
placed on the kitchen counter is given by [` H = f(t) `], where
[` t `] represents the number of minutes since the coffee was put on the 
counter.

    *(a)* Choose the correct word to complete the sentence.  Be sure you can give a reason for your choice:  

    If [`t>0`] then [` f'(t) `] is  
    [_]{ $posneg } 

If you are using MathQuill then click the textbox (Tt) button before entering the answer to part (b).    

    *(b)* 
What are the units of [` f'([$t]) `]?  [____]{ $units } [@ helpLink("units") @]* 

    *(c)* Suppose that [` \lvert f'([$t]) \rvert = [$fp] `] and [` f([$t]) = [$f] `].  Fill in the blanks, including units where needed, and select the appropriate terms to complete the following statement about the temperature of the coffee in this case.

    At [____]{$t}  minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its [_]{$temp} is [______]{NumberWithUnits( $f, "degC" )}  and will [_]{ $inc } 
by about [_______]{ NumberWithUnits( "$fp*$dt", "degC" )} in the next [$dtsec] seconds.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

*(a)*
As the cup of coffee cools, the temperature decreases, so
[` f'(t) `] is negative.

*(b)*
Since [` f'(t) = dH/dt `], the units are degrees Celsius per
minute (degC/min).  The quantity [` f'([$t]) `] represents the rate
at which the coffee is cooling, in degrees per minute, [$t] minutes
after the cup is put on the counter.  Thus we can complete the statement:  

At [$t] minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its temperature
is [$f] degC and will decrease by about [$delf] degC in the next [$dtsec]
seconds.
