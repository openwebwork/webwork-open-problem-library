BEGIN_TEXT

Using a calculator or computer, generate a graph like the one shown
below by graphing \(y = $g\) and \(y = $l\) for 
\( -$lim\le x\le $lim \).  (What is the relationship between 
\(y = $g\) and \(y = $l\)?)
$PAR
$BCENTER
$img
$ECENTER

$PAR
Use your graph to estimate to one decimal place
the (largest) magnitude of the error in approximating
\( $g \) by \( $l \) for \( -$lim\le x\le $lim \).
$BR
error \( \approx \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}
$BR
Is the approximation an over- or an underestimate when \( x \gt 0 \)?
(Enter ${BBOLD}over$EBOLD, or ${BBOLD}under$EBOLD.)
\{ ans_rule(35) \}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

From the figure, we see that the error has its maximum
magnitude at $where, \( x= $xval \).  The magnitude
of the error can be read off a graph of the function and 
tangent line (that is, a graph with somewhat greater resolution
than the given figure) as about $ans, or can be estimated
as
\[
|\hbox{Error}| \le |$ad($xval) - $gend| = $diff \approx $ans.
\]
The approximation is an ${ou}estimate at \(x = $xval\).
