BEGIN_TEXT

In the 1930's L. F. Richardson proposed that an arms race between two
countries could be modeled by a system of differential equations. One
arms race which can be reasonably well described by differential
equations is the US-Soviet Union arms race between 1945 and 1960. If
\(x\) represents the annual Soviet expenditures on armaments (in
billions of dollars) and  \(y\) represents the corresponding US
expenditures, it has been suggested[1] that \( x \) and \( y \) obey the
following differential equations
\[ {dx\over dt} = -0.45x +10.5, \]
\[ {dy\over dt} =  8.2 x - 0.8y -142. \]

By sketching the nullclines and figuring out what directions
trajectories go in each region, be sure you can determine what
you expect typical trajectories in the phase plane will do.

Then, consider the following historical data.  In $year, the arms
budgets \((x,y)\) were ($x0,$y0).  What do you expect to happen to
\(x\) and \(y\) in the long run if we start from this initial condition?

${BBOLD}(a)$EBOLD
The nullclines are when
\[ {dx\over dt} = 0, \qquad \mbox{ so }\qquad x={10.5\over 0.45} = 23.3 \]
and
\[ {dy\over dt} = 0, \qquad\mbox{ so }\qquad 8.2 x - 0.8 y - 142 = 0. \]
$PAR
${BBOLD}(b)$EBOLD
There is an equilibrium point where the nullclines cross, at
\(x=23.3\), \(y=61.7\), as shown in the graph below.

Thus, from any initial condition (and, in particular, from
($x0,$y0)), we expect that \( x\to 23.3 \) and \( y\to 61.7\).
