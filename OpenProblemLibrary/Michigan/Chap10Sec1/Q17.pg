$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Since \(P_2(x)\) is the second degree Taylor polynomial for \(f(x)\)
about \(x=0\), \(P_2(0)=f(0)\), which says \(a=f(0)\).  Since
\(\frac{d}{dx}P_2(x) \big|_{x=0} = f'(0)\),
\(b=f'(0)\); and since
\(\frac{d^2}{dx^2} P_2(x) \big|_{x=0} = f''(0)\),
\(2c=f''(0)\).  In other words, \(a\) is the \(y\)-intercept of
\(f(x)\), \(b\) is the slope of the tangent line to \(f(x)\) at
\(x=0\) and \(c\) tells us the concavity of \(f(x)\) near \(x=0\).
