Consider the differential equation
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = $m x,
 \]
with initial condition \(y(0) = $y0\).

$PAR

Use Euler's method with two steps to estimate  \(y\)  when  \(x=1\):
$BR
\( y(1) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR

each step!)$EITALIC
$PAR
Now use four steps:
$BR
\( y(1) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}

What is the solution to this differential equation (with the given
initial condition)?
$BR
\( y = \) \{ ans_rule(35) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
What is the magnitude of the error in the two Euler approximations you
found? 
$BR
Magnitude of error in Euler with 2 steps = \{ ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
Magnitude of error in Euler with 4 steps = \{ ans_rule(15) \}

$PAR

By what factor should the error in these approximations change (that
is, the error with two steps should be what number times the error
with four)? 
$BR
factor = \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
${BITALIC}(How close to this is the result you obtained above?)$EITALIC

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
Euler's method with two steps uses \(\Delta x = 0.5\), so we have 
$BR
\(y(0) = $y0\),
$BR
\(y(0.5) \approx y(0) + 0.5 ( $m (0) ) = $y0 \), and
$BR
\(y(1) \approx y(0.5) + 0.5 ( $m (0.5) ) = $y0 + $mo4 = $ye2n\).

$PAR
Similarly, with four steps \(\Delta x = 0.25\), so
$BR
\(y(0) = $y0\),
$BR
\(y(0.25) \approx y(0) + 0.25 ( $m (0) ) = $y0 \), 
$BR
\(y(0.5) \approx y(0.25) + 0.25 ($m (0.25)) = $yval1\),
$BR
\(y(0.75) \approx y(0.5) + 0.25 ($m (0.5)) = $yval2\),
$BR
\(y(1) \approx y(0.75) + 0.25 ($m (0.75)) = $ye4n\),

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
We can just integrate to find the solution to the differential
equation: \( y = $mo2 x^2 + C \).  For \(y(0) = $y0\), we must 
have \( y = $mo2 x^2 + $y0 \).

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
The error in the two Euler approximations is just the difference
between the estimates for \(y(1)\) and the exact value.  That is, the
difference between $ye2n and $y1, and between $ye4n and $y1.  Thus,
taking the magnitude of the differences,
$BR
Error in Euler with two steps = $err2, and
$BR
Error in Euler with four steps = $err4.

$PAR
${BBOLD}D.$EBOLD
Since we doubled the number of steps we took, we expect the error to
drop by a factor of two (that is, the error in the Euler approximation
with two steps should be twice as big as that with four), which it is.
