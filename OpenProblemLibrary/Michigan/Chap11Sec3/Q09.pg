Use Euler's method to solve 
\[ \frac{dB}{dt}= $r B \]
with initial value \(B=$b0\) when  \(t=0\) .  

$PAR

\( \Delta t = 1 \) and 1 step: 
\(B(1) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
\( \Delta t = 0.5 \) and 2 steps: 
\(B(1) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

\( \Delta t = 0.25 \) and 4 steps: 
\(B(1) \approx \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR
${BBOLD}D.$EBOLD
Suppose  \(B\) is the balance in a bank account earning interest.
Be sure that you can explain why the result of your calculation in
part (a) is equivalent to compounding the interest once a year instead
of continuously.  Then interpret the result of your calculations in
parts (b) and (c) in terms of compound interest.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

${BBOLD}A.$EBOLD
With one step of \(\Delta t = 1\), we have 
$BR
\( B(1) \approx $b0 + (1)($r)($b0) = $beul1n\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}B.$EBOLD
With two steps of \(\Delta t = 0.5\), we have 
$BR
\( B(0.5) \approx $b0 + (0.5)($r)($b0) = $bval1\), $BR
\( B(1) \approx $bval1 + (0.5)($r)($bval1) = $beul2n\).
$PAR
Note that we can simplify this some: 
\(B(0.5) \approx (1 + \frac{$r}{2}) ($b0)\), so that 
\(B(1) \approx B(0.5) + \frac{$r}{2} B(0.5) = (1 + \frac{$r}{2})^2 ($b0)\).

$PAR
${BBOLD}C.$EBOLD
With four steps of \(\Delta t = 0.25\), we have, following the pattern
we saw in (B), $BR
\( B(0.25) \approx $b0 + (0.25)($r)($b0) = (1 + \frac{$r}{4}) ($b0)\), $BR
\( B(0.5) \approx B(0.25) + (0.25)($r) B(0.25) = (1 + \frac{$r}{4})^2 ($b0)\),
$BR
\( B(0.75) \approx B(0.5) + (0.25)($r) B(0.5) = (1 + \frac{$r}{4})^3 ($b0)\),
and
\( B(1) \approx B(0.75) + (0.25)($r) B(0.75) = (1 + \frac{$r}{4})^4 ($b0)
   = $beul4nr \).

$PAR
${BBOLD}D.$EBOLD
In part (A), we get our approximation by making a single
increment, \(\Delta B\), where \(\Delta B\) is just \( $r B\).  If we
think in terms of interest, \(\Delta B\) is just like getting one end
of the year interest payment.  Since \(\Delta B\) is $r times the
balance \(B\), it is like getting $delb1 dollars.

$PAR
Part (B) is equivalent to computing the final amount in an
account that begins with $b0 dollars and earns $delb1 dollars 
twice annually.  Each step is like computing the interest after
6 months.  When \(t=0.5\), for example, the interest is
\(\Delta B=($r B)\cdot\frac{1}{2}\), and we add this to $b0 dollars 
to get the new balance.

$PAR
Similarly, part (C) is equivalent to the final amount in an account
that has an initial balance of $b0 dollars and earns $delb1 dollars
compounded quarterly.
