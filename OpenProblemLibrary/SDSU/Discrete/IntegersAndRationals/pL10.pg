# Solution

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
If an integer \(x\) is divisible by \(21\), then it must also be divisible by all of the divisors of \(21\). This is simply the transitivity of "divides," perhaps working in the opposite direction of what we're used to. $PAR
Thus, if \(21|x\), then the following integers also divide \(x\): $BR
\(1,3,7\) $PAR
Similarly, if \(16|a\), then the following integers also divide \(a\): $BR
\(1,2,4,8\) $PAR
