SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
Perhaps the easiest way to determine the greatest common divisor of two numbers is to use the Euclidian algorithm. The Euclidian algorithm is based off of the Quotient-Remainder Theorem, which states that for any integer \(n\), $BR 
\(n = dq + r\) $BR 
where \(d\) is the divisor, $BR 
\(q\) is the quotient, $BR 
and \(r\) is the remainder. $PAR
The Euclidian algorithm exploits the fact that \(gcd(n,d) = gcd(d,r)\) (this is a fairly simple proof that will be left for another exercise). With this in mind, we can repeatedly express an integer \(n\) as \(dq + r\), which will eventually produce the greatest common divisor that we are looking for. $PAR
\(\mathrm{gcd}($a,$b)\) $BR
\($a = $b\cdot 2 + 32\) $BR
Now we use the knowledge that \(gcd($a,$b) = gcd($b,32)\) $BR
\($b = 32\cdot 1 + 10\) $BR
\(32 = 10\cdot 3 + 2\) $BR
\(10 = 2\cdot 5 + 0\) $PAR
Once we obtain a remainder of \(0\), we have found the greatest common divisor. It will always be \(d\) from the expression \(n = dq + r\), which in this case is \($answer\). $BR
It should be clear that since \(gcd(10,2) = gcd(32,10) = gcd(42,32) = gcd($a,$b)\), $BR
\(\mathrm{gcd}($a,$b) = $answer\) $PAR
