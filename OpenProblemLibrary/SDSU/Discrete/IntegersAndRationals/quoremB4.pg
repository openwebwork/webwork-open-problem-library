# Solution

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\($var1 = $a\) $BR
\($var2 = $b\) $PAR
The Quotient-Remainder theorem states that for any integer \(n\), \(n=dq+r\) where \(d\) is the divisor, \(q\) is the quotient, and \(r\) is the remainder. $PAR
For \(\frac{$var1}{$var2}\), \($var1\) is the integer \(n\), and \($var2\) is the divisor \(d\). $BR
Under the least nonnegative remainder method, the goal is to solve for \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(r\) is as small as possible (but not negative). $BR
In this case, that yields the solution \($a = $b\cdot $abQuoNN + $abRemNN\) $BR
Thus, the quotient is $BR
\($abQuoNN\) $BR
and the remainder is $BR 
\($abRemNN\) $PAR
Under the least absolute remainder method, the goal is to solve for \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(|r|\) is as small as possible. $BR
In this case, that yields the solution \($a = $b\cdot $abQuoAbs + $abRemAbs\) $BR
Thus, the quotient is $BR
\($abQuoAbs\) $BR
and the remainder is $BR
\($abRemAbs\) $BR
