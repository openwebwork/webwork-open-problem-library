SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
Perhaps the easiest way to determine the greatest common divisor of two numbers is to use the Euclidian algorithm. The Euclidian algorithm is based off of the Quotient-Remainder Theorem, which states that for any integer \(n\), $BR 
\(n = dq + r\) $BR 
where \(d\) is the divisor, $BR 
\(q\) is the quotient, $BR 
and \(r\) is the remainder. $PAR
The Euclidian algorithm exploits the fact that \(gcd(n,d) = gcd(d,r)\) (this is a fairly simple proof that will be left for another exercise). With this in mind, we can repeatedly express an integer \(n\) as \(dq + r\), which will eventually produce the greatest common divisor that we are looking for. $PAR
\(gcd($a,$b)\) $BR
\($a = $b\cdot 1 + 136\) $BR
Now we use the knowledge that \(gcd($a,$b) = gcd($b,32)\) $BR
\($b = 136\cdot 1 + 85\) $BR
\(136 = 85\cdot 1 + 51\) $BR
\(85 = 51\cdot 1 + 34\) $BR
\(51 = 34\cdot 1 + 17\) $BR
\(34 = 17\cdot 2 + 0\) $PAR
Once we obtain a remainder of \(0\), we have found the greatest common divisor. It will always be \(d\) from the expression \(n = dq + r\), which in this case is \($answer\). $BR
It should be clear that since $BR
\(gcd(34,17) = gcd(51,34) = gcd(85,51) = gcd(136,85) = gcd(221,136) = gcd($a,$b)\), $BR
\(gcd($a,$b) = $answer\) $PAR
