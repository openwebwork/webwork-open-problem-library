$PAR Solution: $PAR
The smallest integer > 1 which is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is \(64\) $PAR
The smallest integer with the prime factorization \(p\cdot q\) is \(2\cdot 3 = 6\) $BR
The next three smallest integers with prime factorization \(p\cdot q\) are \(2\cdot 5 = 10\), \(2\cdot 7 = 14\), and \(3\cdot 5 = 15\) $PAR
The smallest integer with prime factorization \(p\cdot q\cdot r\) is \(2\cdot 3\cdot 5 = 30\) $PAR
