$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{$statement}\) $BR $BR
\(\text{p: $p}\) $BR
\(\text{q: $q}\) $BR $BR
First, translate the statement into formal logic. $BR
In this statement, \(p\) can be true, xor \(q\) can be true, or neither can be true. The key here is that while either one $BBOLD can $EBOLD succeed, there is no guarantee of success. The expression is then equal to $BR
\( $neg (p\wedge q)\)
$PAR
Now, negate the statement. $BR
\( $neg ( $neg (p\wedge q))\) $BR
\(\equiv $neg $neg (p\wedge q)\) $BR
\(\equiv p\wedge q\) $BR
The answer is then $BR
\(p\wedge q\)
$PAR
As an extra exercise, what would this statement translate to in English?
