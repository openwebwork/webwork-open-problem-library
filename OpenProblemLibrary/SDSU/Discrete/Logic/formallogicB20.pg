SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
Original statement: $BR $BR
\(\text{$statement}\) $BR $BR
Let \(p\) be the statement \(\text{$p}\) $BR
Let \(q\) be the statement \(\text{$q}\)
$PAR
First, translate the statement into formal logic. $BR
In this statement, \(p\) is true, and \(q\) is true. Therefore, the correct answer is \(p\) $BBOLD and $EBOLD \(q\), or \(p\wedge q\).
$PAR
Now, negate the statement. $BR
\( $neg (p\wedge q)\) $BR
\(\equiv ( $neg p\vee $neg q)\) $BR
Thus, the answer is $BR
\( $neg p\vee $neg q\)
$PAR
Recall what \(p\) and \(q\) represent: $BR $BR
\(\text{p: $p}\) $BR
\(\text{q: $q}\) $BR $BR
From \( $neg p\vee $neg q\), we get $BR
\(\text{Mike is not tall, or Karen is not tall.}\)
