SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{$statement}\) $BR $BR
Let \(p\) be the statement \(\text{Jack goes to school}\). $BR
Let \(q\) be the statement \(\text{Jack passes his classes}\). $BR
The statement then translates to \(p\vee\{ negate()\} q\), which is logically equivalent to \(\{ negate()\} p\rightarrow\{ negate()\} q\). Therefore, the answer is \(\text{If Jack doesn't go to school, then he doesn't pass his classes.}\)
