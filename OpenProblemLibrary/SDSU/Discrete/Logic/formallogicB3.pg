$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{$statement}\) $BR $BR
\(\text{p: $p}\) $BR
\(\text{q: $q}\) $BR
\(\text{r: $r}\) $BR
\(\text{s: $s}\) $BR $BR
In this statement, \(p\) can be true, or \(q\) can be true, but not both. In this situation, \(xor\) is used in place of \(or\) to signify that only one can be true. Therefore, the correct answer is \((p\) $BBOLD xor $EBOLD \(q)\) $BBOLD and $EBOLD \((r\) $BBOLD or $EBOLD \(s)\), or \((\text{p xor q})\wedge (r\vee s)\)
