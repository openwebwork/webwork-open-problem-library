SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{$statement}\) $BR $BR
Let \(p\) be the statement \(\text{John owns a dog}\). $BR
Let \(q\) be the statement \(\text{John owns a cat}\). $BR
The statement then translates to \(\{ negate()\} p\vee q\), which is logically equivalent to \(p\rightarrow q\). Therefore, the answer is $BR 
\(\text{If John owns a dog, then he owns a cat.}\)
