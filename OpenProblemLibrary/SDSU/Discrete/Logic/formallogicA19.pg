# Solution

Context()->texStrings;
SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
Original statement: $BR $BR
\(\text{$statement}\) $BR $BR
\(\text{p: $p}\) $BR
\(\text{q: $q}\) $BR $BR
In this statement, if \(p\) is true, then \(q\) is false. This is an \(implies\) relationship. Thus, the answer is $BR
\(p\rightarrow\sim q\)
$PAR
Now, negate the statement. $BR
In order to negate this statement, first translate it into an \(or\) statement to get rid of the \(implies\) operator. $BR
\(p\rightarrow\sim q\equiv\sim p\vee\sim q\) $BR
\(\sim (\sim p\vee\sim q)\) $BR
\(\equiv p\wedge q\) $BR
Thus, the answer is \(p\wedge q\)
$PAR
Recall what \(p\) and \(q\) represent: $BR $BR
\(\text{p: $p}\) $BR
\(\text{q: $q}\) $BR $BR
From \(p\wedge q\), we get $BR
\(\text{Mary fails her classes, and she can graduate.}\)
