$PAR Solution: $PAR
\($var = \lbrace $pretty\rbrace\)
$PAR
Subsets of \($var\) include: $BR
\(\lbrace a,f,g\rbrace\) $BR
\(\lbrace a,b,c,f,g\rbrace\) $BR $BR
Remember that a set is always a subset of itself. By definition, for sets \(A\) and \(B\), \(A=B\) if and only if \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\subseteq A\). From this definition, it is clear that since \(A=A\) for any set \(A\), \(A\subseteq A\) must also be true.
