SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(A^c\) is defined as the set of elements that are not in \(A\). This set must be restricted by the elements avaiable to the "universe," \(U\). An easy way to think of the complement is to think of the difference between the universe and the set, or \(U-A\). $BR $BR
Since \(A=U\), \(A-U\) yields the empty set, \(\lbrace\rbrace\), which contains zero elements. $BR
