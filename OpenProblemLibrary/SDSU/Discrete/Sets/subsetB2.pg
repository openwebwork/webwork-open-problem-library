SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\($var = \lbrace $pretty\rbrace\)
$PAR
Subsets of \($var\) include: $BR
\(\lbrace\rbrace\) $BR
\(\lbrace x\rbrace\) $BR
\(\lbrace x^4,x^2\rbrace\) $BR $BR
Remember that the empty set is a subset of all sets. Also keep in mind that the order of a set does not matter.
