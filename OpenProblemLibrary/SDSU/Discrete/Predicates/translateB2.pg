# Solution

Context()->texStrings;
SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{Not everyone is good at sports.}\) $PAR
Let \(X = \lbrace people\rbrace\) $BR
\(P(x)\) be the predicate \(x\text{ is good at sports.}\) $PAR
In universal form, the statement translates to $BR
\(\sim (\forall x\in X, P(x))\) $PAR
In existential form, the statement translates to $BR
\(\exists x\in X : \sim P(x)\) $BR
From its existential form, the statement translates to $BR
\(\text{There exists someone who is not good at sports}\)
