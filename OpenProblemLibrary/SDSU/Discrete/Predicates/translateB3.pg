Consider the following statement: $PAR
\(\text{All dogs pant when it is hot outside.}\) $PAR
For the following questions, $BR
Let \(X = \lbrace dogs\rbrace\) $BR
\(P(x)\) be the predicate \(x\text{ pants when it is hot outside.}\) $PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}

# Solution

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{All dogs pant when it is hot outside.}\) $PAR
Let \(X = \lbrace dogs\rbrace\) $BR
\(P(x)\) be the predicate \(x\text{ pants when it is hot outside.}\) $PAR
In universal form, the statement translates to $BR
\(\forall x\in X, P(x)\) $PAR
In existential form, the statement translates to $BR
\(\sim\exists x\in X : \sim P(x)\) $BR
From its existential form, the statement translates to $BR
\(\text{There does not exist a dog that does not pant when it is hot outside}\)
