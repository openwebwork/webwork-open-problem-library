BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the following statement: $PAR
\(\text{No prime numbers are divisible by 2.}\) $PAR
For the following questions, $BR
Let \(X = \lbrace\text{prime numbers}\rbrace\) $BR
\(P(x)\) be the predicate \(x\text{ is divisible by 2.}\) $PAR
\{$radio->print_q()\}
\{$radio->print_a()\} $PAR

# Solution

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR Solution: $PAR
\(\text{No prime numbers are divisible by 2.}\) $PAR
Let \(X = \lbrace\text{prime numbers}\rbrace\) $BR
\(P(x)\) be the predicate \(x\text{ is divisible by 2.}\) $PAR
The statement's quantified form is $BR
\(\forall x\in X, \sim P(x)\) $PAR
In order to negate the statement, $BR
\(\sim (\forall x\in X, \sim P(x))\) $BR
\(\equiv \exists x\in X : P(x)\) $BR
In English, this statement translates to $BR
\(\text{There exists a prime number that is divisible by 2}\)
