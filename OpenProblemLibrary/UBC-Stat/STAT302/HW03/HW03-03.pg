Fred, Burt, Conrad, Otto, and Hugh run a race. All the runners can be taken to have the same level of ability, so it may be assumed that all of the possible orderings of the five runners are equally likely. Express your answers to the questions to two decimals.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR

Part a) $BR $BR

There are \( 5! = 120 \) possible orderings for the five runners, each of which are taken to be equally likely. For Burt to occupy first place, there would be \( 4! \) orderings for the other places, hence, 

$BR

\( \begin{align*} P(\text{Burt wins}) &= \frac{4!}{5!} \\ &= \frac{1}{5} \\ &= 0.2. \end{align*} \)
