BEGIN_PGML
Consider a species of bird that can be split into three age groupings:  those aged 0-1 years, those aged 1-2 years, and those aged 2-3 years.  The population is observed once a year.  Given that the Leslie matrix is equal to 
[```L = [$L] ```]
and the initial population distribution is: [$p1] of the first age group,  [$p2] of the second age group, and  [$p3] of the oldest age group, answer the following questions.

The initial population vector is 
[` \mathbf{x}_0 = `][_]*{$x0}.

How many birds aged 1-2 years are there after 10 years? [_____]{$ans1}

How many birds aged 0-1 years are there after 20 years? [_____]{$ans2}

How many birds are there after 30 years? [_____]{$ans3}

Calculate the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix good to 3 decimal places.  [`\lambda_1\ =\ `][_____]{$lambda->cmp(
  tolType => 'absolute',
  tolerance => 0.002
)}

What is the long-term growth rate of this population of birds as a percent?    
Growth rate = [_____]{$rate->cmp(
  tolType => 'absolute',
  tolerance => 0.2
)}  
(The growth rate is the percentage of growth over/under 100%.)

Are the birds thriving, static, or going extinct?  [_]{$popup}
