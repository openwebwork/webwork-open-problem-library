BEGIN_TEXT
Consider a species of bird that can be split into three age groupings:  those aged 0-1 years, those aged 1-2 years, and those aged 2-3 years.  The population is observed once a year.  Given that the Leslie matrix is equal to 
\[L = $L\]
and the initial population distribution is \($p1\) of the first age group,  \($p2\) of the second age group, and  \($p3\) of the oldest age group, answer the following questions.
$BR$BR
The initial population vector is 
\( \mathbf{x}_0 = \) \{ $x0->ans_array(5) \}.
$BR
$BR
How many birds aged 1-2 years are there after 10 years? \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
How many birds aged 0-1 years are there after 20 years? \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
How many birds are there after 30 years? \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
Calculate the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix good to 3 decimal places.  \(\lambda_1\ =\ \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
What is the long-term growth rate of this population of birds as a percent?  growth rate = \{ans_rule(10)\}  (The growth rate is the percentage of growth over/under 100%.)
$BR
$BR 
Are the birds thriving, static, or going extinct?  \{ $popup->menu() \}
