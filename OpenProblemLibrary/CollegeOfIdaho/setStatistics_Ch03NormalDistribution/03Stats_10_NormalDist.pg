#  Main

BEGIN_TEXT
Almost all medical schools in the United States require applicants to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). On one exam, the scores of all applicants on the biological sciences part of the MCAT were approximately Normal with mean $mean_all and standard deviation $sd_all. For applicants who actually entered medical school, the mean score was $mean_med and the standard deviation was $sd_med.

$PAR
(a) What percent of all applicants had scores higher than $cutoff_a?
$BR $SPACE $SPACE ANSWER: $SPACE \{ans_rule(5)\} %

$PAR
(b) What percent of those who entered medical school had scores between $cutoff_b1 and $cutoff_b2? 
$BR $SPACE $SPACE ANSWER: $SPACE \{ans_rule(5)\} %
