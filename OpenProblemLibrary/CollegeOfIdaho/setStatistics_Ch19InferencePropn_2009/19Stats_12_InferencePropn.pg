A new cream that advertises that it can reduce wrinkles and improve skin was subject to a recent
study. A sample of \($n\) women over the age of 50 used the new cream for 6 months. Of those \($n\)
women, \($x\) of them reported skin improvement(as judged by a dermatologist). Is this evidence that
the cream will improve the skin of more than \($perc\)$PERCENT of women over the age of 50? Test
using \(\alpha = $alpha\).
