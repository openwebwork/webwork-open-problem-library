$name[$person] wants to determine a $level[$choose] percent confidence interval 
for the true proportion of high school students in the area who attend 
their home basketball games. How large of a sample must $pronoun have 
to get a margin of error less than $m?  [To find n, use the value 
p* = 1/2 for the sample proportion and the values for z* from Table C.]

$PAR
[Round to the smallest integer that works.]
