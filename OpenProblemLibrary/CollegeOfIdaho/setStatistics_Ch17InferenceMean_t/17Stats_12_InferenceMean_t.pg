BEGIN_TEXT
An agricultural field trial compares the yield of two varieties of corn.  The researchers divide in half each of
$n fields of land in different locations and plant each corn variety in one half of each plot.  After harvest, the
yields are compared in bushels per acre at each location.  The $n differences (Variety A - Variety B) give
\( \bar{x} = $mean \) and \( s = $s\).  Does this sample provide evidence that Variety A had a higher yield
than Variety B?

$PAR
(a) State the null and alternative hypotheses:
(Type "mu" for the symbol \( \mu \) , e.g.  $BBOLD mu \( > \) 1 $EBOLD 
for the mean is greater than 1, $BBOLD mu \( < \) 1 $EBOLD 
for the mean is less than 1, $BBOLD mu not = 1 $EBOLD 
for the mean is not equal to 1)
$BR
  \( H_0\) : \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
  \( H_a\) : \{ ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
(b) Find the test statistic, t =  \{ ans_rule(10) \} 

$PAR
(c) Answer the question: Does this sample provide evidence that Variety A had a higher yield
than Variety B? (Use a 5$PERCENT level of significance) 
$BR
(Type: Yes or No) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
