#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
 $name[$m] thinks that people living in a rural environment have a healthier lifestyle
than other people.  $pronoun believes the average lifespan in the USA is 77 years. A random 
sample of $n obituaries from newspapers from rural towns in Idaho give \( \bar{x} = $mean \) 
and \( s = $s\).  Does this sample provide evidence that people living in rural Idaho communities live 
longer than 77 years?

$PAR
(a) State the null and alternative hypotheses:  (Type "mu" for the symbol \( \mu \) , 
 e.g.  $BBOLD mu \( > \)1 $EBOLD for the mean is greater than 1,  $BBOLD mu \( < \) 1 $EBOLD 
for the mean is less than 1, $BBOLD mu not = 1 $EBOLD for the mean is not equal to 1)
$BR
  \( H_0\) : \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
  \( H_a\) : \{ ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
(b) Find the test statistic, t =  \{ ans_rule(10) \} 

$PAR
(c) Answer the question: Does this sample provide evidence that people living in rural Idaho communities live 
longer than 77 years? (Use a 10% level of significance)
$BR
(Type: Yes or No) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
