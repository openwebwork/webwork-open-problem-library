#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The one-sample  $BITALIC t $EITALIC statistic for a test of
$PAR
\(H_0: \mu = $mu \) 
$PAR
\( H_a: \mu < $mu \)
$BR
based on  n = $n[$choose]  observations has the value $BITALIC t $EITALIC= $tscore[$choose].

$PAR
(a) What are the degrees of freedom for this statistic? \{ ans_rule(5)\}

$PAR
(b) Between what two probabilities P from Table C does the P-value of the test fall?  
$BR
(State the smaller probability in the left box.)
 \{ ans_rule(5)\} to \{ ans_rule(5)\}
