#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Justin is interested in buying a digital phone.  He visited $n stores at random and recorded the
price of the particular phone he wants. The sample of prices had a mean of $mean and a
standard deviation of $s. 
$PAR

(a) What t-score should be used for a 95$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean,
\( \mu \), of the distribution? 
$BR
 t* = \{ ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b) Calculate a 95$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean price of this model of digital phone:
$BR (Enter the smaller value in the left answer box.)
$BR
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} to \{ ans_rule(10) \}
