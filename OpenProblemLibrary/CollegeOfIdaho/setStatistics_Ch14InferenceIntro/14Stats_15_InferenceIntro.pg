BEGIN_TEXT
$name[$m] thinks a certain potato chip maker is putting fewer chips in their regular bags of chips.
From a random sample of $n bags of potato chips $pronoun calculated a $BITALIC P $EITALIC value
of $p for the sample.

$PAR
(a)  At a 5$PERCENT level of significance, is there evidence that $name[$m] is correct?  (Type: Yes or No):  \{ ans_rule(5)\}

$PAR
(b)  At a 10$PERCENT level of significance, is there evidence that $pronoun is correct?  (Type: Yes or No):  \{ ans_rule(5)\}

$PAR
(c)  \{ $mc ->print_q() \} 
$BR
 \{ $mc ->print_a() \}
