#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A study of the career paths of hotel general managers sent questionnaires to an SRS
of $n1 hotels belonging to major U.S. hotel chains.  There were $n2 responses.  The
average time these $n2 general managers had spent with their current company was 
$xbar years.  (Take it as known that the standard deviation of time with the company
for all general managers is $sigma years.)

$PAR
(a)  Find the margin of error for $article[$choose] $CI$PERCENT confidence interval to estimate
the mean time a general manager had spent with their current company:  \{ans_rule(15)\}  years 

$PAR
(b)   Find the margin of error for a 99$PERCENT confidence interval to estimate
the mean time a general manager had spent with their current company:  \{ans_rule(15)\}  years 

$PAR
(c)    In general, increasing the confidence level \{ans_rule(15)\} the margin of error (width)
of the confidence interval.  (Enter: ''DECREASES'', ''DOES NOT CHANGE'' or
''INCREASES'', without the quotes.)
