#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
It is necessary for an automobile producer to estimate the number of miles per gallon (mpg)
achieved by its cars.  Suppose that the sample mean for a random sample of \($n \)
cars is \($mean\) mpg and assume the standard deviation is \($sigma\) mpg.  Now suppose
the car producer wants to test the hypothesis that \(\mu \), the mean number of miles
per gallon, is \($mu\) against the alternative hypothesis that it is not \($mu\). 
Conduct a test using a significance level of \(\alpha = .05\) by giving the following:

$PAR
(a)  The test statistic  \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(b) The $BITALIC P $EITALIC-value  \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(c)  \{ $mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
