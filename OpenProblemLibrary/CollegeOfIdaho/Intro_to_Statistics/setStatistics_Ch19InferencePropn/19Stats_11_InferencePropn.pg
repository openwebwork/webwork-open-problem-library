#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A survey of \( $n \) people who took trips revealed that \( $x \) of them included 
a visit to a theme park. Based on those survey results, a management consultant claims
that less than \( $p \) $PERCENT of trips include a theme park visit. 
Test this claim using the \( \alpha = $alpha \) significance level.
