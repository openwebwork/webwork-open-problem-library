BEGIN_TEXT
Physicians at a clinic gave what they thought were drugs to \($n\) asthma,
ulcer, and herpes patients. Although the doctors later learned that the drugs
were really placebos, \($a\) $PERCENT of the patients reported an improved
condition. Assume that if the placebo is ineffective, the probability of a
patients condition improving is \($p\). For the hypotheses that the proportion
who improve is \($p\) against that it is greater than \($p\), find the P-value.

$PAR
 P-value = \{ans_rule(10)\}
