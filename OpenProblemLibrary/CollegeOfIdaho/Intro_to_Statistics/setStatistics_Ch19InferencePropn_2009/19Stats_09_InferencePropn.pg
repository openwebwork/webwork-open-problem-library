A newspaper conducted a statewide survey concerning the 1998 
race for state senator.  The newspaper took a SRS of \( n = 
$n[$choose] \) registered voters 
and found that $x[$choose] would vote for the Republican candidate.  Let \(p\) 
represent the proportion of registered voters in the state who would vote for 
the Republican candidate.
