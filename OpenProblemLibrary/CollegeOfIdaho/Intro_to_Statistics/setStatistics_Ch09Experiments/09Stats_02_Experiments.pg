#  Main

BEGIN_TEXT
A study of human development showed two types of movies to a group of children. Crackers were available in a bowl, 
and the investigators compared the number of crackers eaten by the children while watching the different kinds of movies. One kind was shown at 8 A.M. and another at 11 A.M.  It was found that during the movie shown at 11 A.M., more crackers 
were eaten than during the movie shown at 8 A.M.  The investigators concluded that the different types of movies had 
an effect on appetite.
