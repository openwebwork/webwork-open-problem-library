#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The sample size needed to estimate the difference between two population proportions to 
within a margin of error \( E \) with a significance level of \( \alpha \) can be found 
as follows. In the expression 
\[ E = z^*\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \]

we replace both \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) by \( n \) 
(assuming that both samples have the same size) and 
replace each of \( p_1,\) and \( p_2, \) by \( 0.5\) 
(because their values are not known). Then we solve for n, and get 
\[ n = \frac{(z^*)^2}{2E^2}. \]

Finally, increase the value of \( n \) to the next larger integer number. $PAR

Use the above formula and Table C to find the size of each sample needed to estimate the difference between the proportions of boys and girls under 10 years old who are afraid of spiders.  Assume that we want a \($CI[$pick]\)$PERCENT confidence level and that the error is smaller than \($e.\) $PAR
\( n = \)\{ans_rule(30)\}
