#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
One of the most feared predators in the ocean is the great white shark. It is known that the
white shark grows to a mean length of \($mean\) feet; however, one marine biologist believes
that great white sharks off the Bermuda coast grow much longer. To test this claim,
full-grown white sharks were captured, measured, and then set free. However, this was a
difficult, costly and very dangerous task, so only four sharks were actually sampled. Their
lengths were \($l[0], \ $l[1], \ $l[2], \mbox{and} \ $l[3] \) feet. Do the data provide
sufficient evidence to support the claim? Use \(\alpha = $alpha\).

$PAR
(a) Calculate the test statistic: t = \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b) Find the critical value: t* =  \{ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(c) \{ $mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
