BEGIN_TEXT
The hemoglobin count (HC) in grams per 100 milliliters of whole blood is approximately normally distributed with
population mean 14 for healthy adult women.  Suppose  a female patient has had $n laboratory blood tests
during the past year.  Her average HC is $mean with s = $s.  Is there evidence that her average HC is not 14?

$PAR
(a) State the null and alternative hypotheses:  (Type "mu" for the symbol \( \mu \) , 
 e.g.  $BBOLD mu \( > \) 1 $EBOLD for the mean is greater than 1,  $BBOLD mu \( < \) 1 $EBOLD for the mean is 
less than 1, $BBOLD mu not = 1 $EBOLD for the mean is not equal to 1)
$BR
  \( H_0\) : \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
  \( H_a\) : \{ ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
(b) Find the test statistic, t =  \{ ans_rule(10) \} 

$PAR
(c) Answer the question:   Is there evidence that her average HC is not 14? (Use a 1$PERCENT level of significance)
$BR
(Type: Yes or No) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
