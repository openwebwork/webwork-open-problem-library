BEGIN_TEXT
For each situation, state the null and alternative hypotheses:  (Type "mu" for the symbol \( \mu \) , 
 e.g.  $BBOLD mu \( > \) 1 $EBOLD for the mean is greater than 1,  $BBOLD mu \( < \) 1 $EBOLD for the mean is 
less than 1, $BBOLD mu not = 1 $EBOLD for the mean is not equal to 1. Please do not include units such as "mm" or "$" in your answer.)

$PAR
(a) The diameter of a spindle in a small motor is supposed to be $mu1 millimeters (mm) 
with a standard deviation of $sigma1 mm.  If the spindle is either too small or too
large, the motor will not work properly.  The manufacturer measures the diameter 
in a sample of $n1 spindles to determine whether the mean diameter has moved away 
from the required measurement. Suppose the sample has an average diameter of $xbar1 mm.

$PAR
(b) Harry thinks that prices in 
Caldwell are $direction[$choose] than the rest of the country.  He reads that the nationwide average price of a
certain brand of laundry detergent is $display_mu2  with standard deviation
$display_sigma2.  He takes a sample from $n2 local Caldwell stores and finds
the average price for this same brand of detergent is $display_xbar2.
