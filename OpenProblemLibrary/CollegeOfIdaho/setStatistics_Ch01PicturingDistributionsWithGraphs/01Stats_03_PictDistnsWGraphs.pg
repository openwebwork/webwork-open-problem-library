BEGIN_PGML

Popular magazines rank colleges and universities on their academic quality in serving undergraduate students. Below are several variables that might contribute to ranking colleges. Which of these are categorical and which are quantitative? 

a)   [$sevent[0]]

    Answer: [_]{$dd[0]}

b)   [$sevent[1]]

    Answer: [_]{$dd[1]}

c)   [$sevent[2]]

    Answer: [_]{$dd[2]}

d)   [$sevent[3]]

    Answer: [_]{$dd[3]}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
