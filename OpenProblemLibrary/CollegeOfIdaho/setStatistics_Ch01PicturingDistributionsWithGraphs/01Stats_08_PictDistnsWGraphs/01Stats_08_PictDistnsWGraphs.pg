BEGIN_PGML
In a statistics class with [$total] students, the professor records how much money
each student has in their possession during the first class of the semester.
The histogram below is of the data collected.


[! alt text !]{$graph}{450}

a) The number of students with under $10 in their possession is [_]{$y[0]}{5}

b) The histogram is 

    [_]{$rb2}

c) The percentage of students with over $20 in their possession is

    [_]{$rb3}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
For this, read off the approximate bar heights to answer the questions. 

a) This needs a careful eye, but the answer is [$y[0]]. 

b) Because there is a large peak on the left and a long tail to the right, this is _skewed right_. 

c) For this, total all of the heights of the bars.  The total heights of those over $30 is [$over30] and since there are [$total] students, this is about 10%.
