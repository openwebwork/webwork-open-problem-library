$BBOLD Note 1: $EBOLD Factor each polynomial completely.  Use 
only integers for the coefficients.  
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 2: $EBOLD If polynomial does not factor, enter 
$BITALIC Does not factor$EITALIC or enter the polynomial as your answer.
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 3: $EBOLD If the polynomial has two or more equal factors, combine
them in the form: $BITALIC (a x + b y)^n$EITALIC.
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 4: $EBOLD Enter the factored form like:
$BR
Correct: $BITALIC 5x(x+2)^2(3x-4)$EITALIC
$BR
Not correct: $BITALIC (x+2)(x+2)(3x-4)5x$EITALIC
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 5: $EBOLD Do not use unnecessary parentheses within a
factor.  Only parentheses will be accepted--no brackets or braces.
