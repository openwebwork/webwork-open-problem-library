#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A market research firm supplies manufacturers with estimates of the retail sales
of their products from samples of retail stores.  Marketing managers are prone to look at
the estimate and ignore sampling error.  An SRS of  \( $n1 \) stores this year shows
mean sales of \( $x1 \) units of a small appliance, with a standard deviation of \( $s1 \) 
units.  During the same point in time last year, an SRS of \( $n2 \) stores had mean sales of
\( $x2 \) units, with standard deviation \( $s2 \) units.  $IncDec from \( $x2 \) to 
\( $x1 \) is a $IncDec2 of about $PercentDiff$PERCENT.

$BR $BR
1.  Construct a $perc$PERCENT confidence interval estimate of the difference
\( \mu_1 - \mu_2 \), where \( \mu_1 \) is the mean of this year's sales and \( \mu_2 \)
is the mean of last year's sales.

$PAR
(a)  \{ans_rule(15)\}\( < (\mu_1 - \mu_2) < \)\{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
(b)  The margin of error is \{ans_rule(15)\}.

$BR $BR
2.  At a  \( $alpha \) significance level, \{ $mc -> print_q() \} $BR

\{ $mc -> print_a() \} $BR
