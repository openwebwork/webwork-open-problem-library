#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Scrapie is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. A study of the
substance IDX as a treatment for scrapie used as subjects $nTotal infected hamsters.
$Num[$choose], chosen at random, were injected with IDX.  The other $n were untreated.
The researchers recorded how long each hamster lived.  They reported:
$BITALIC 
Thus, although all infected control hamsters had died by $days1 days after infection 
(mean  \( \pm \)  SEM  = $x1 \( \pm \) $SEM1),  IDX-treated hamsters lived up to $days2 days
 (mean  \( \pm \) SEM = $x2 \( \pm \) $SEM2). Readers are supposed to know that
SEM stands for the standard error of the mean.
$EITALIC

$PAR
(a) For the group injected with IDX , find:
$BR
The mean, \( \bar x \) = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
The standard deviation, \(s\) = \{ans_rule(15)\}

$PAR
(b)  For the untreated group, find:
$BR
The mean, \( \bar x \) = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
The standard deviation, \(s\) = \{ans_rule(15)\}
