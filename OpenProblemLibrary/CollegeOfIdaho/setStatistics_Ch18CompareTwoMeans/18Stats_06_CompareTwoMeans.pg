#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
$name[$m] thinks that there is a difference in quality of life between rural and urban living.  
$Pronoun collects information from obituaries in newspapers from urban and rural towns in 
Idaho to see if there is a difference in life expectancy.  A sample of $n1 people from rural towns 
give a life expectancy of \( \bar{x_r} = $mean1 \) years with a standard deviation of 
\( s_r = $s1\) years.  A sample of $n2 people from larger towns give \( \bar{x_u} = $mean2 \) years
and \( s_u = $s2\) years.  Does this provide evidence that people living in rural Idaho communities have
different life expectancy than those in more urban communities? Use a $alphaPercent% level of 
significance.

for the means are not equal, $BBOLD \(mu\_r > mu\_u \)$EBOLD for the rural mean is larger,   
$BBOLD \( mu\_r < mu\_u \) $EBOLD, for the rural mean is smaller.  )
