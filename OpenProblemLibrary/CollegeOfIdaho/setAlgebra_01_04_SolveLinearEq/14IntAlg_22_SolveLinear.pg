$time  = random(10, 15, 1);
$money = 165 * $time + 2771;

$year = Compute(1996 + $time);

BEGIN_PGML
The average cost of tuition and fees at public four year colleges in the
United States can be modeled by the formula
[``` T = 165x+2771, ```]
where _T_ represents the average cost of tuition and fees for the school
year ending _x_ years after 1996.  Use the formula to determine the year
when tuition and fees at public U.S. colleges average $[$money].

(Note: Give the year. For example, if you calculate that the answer is 9 years
after 1996, then enter _2005_.)

Answer: [_]{$year}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In this case, the value of [`T`] is given by [$money] and then we solve:
[``` [$money] = 165 x + 2771 ```]

Subtract 2771 from both sides:

[```[$money-2771] = 165 x ```]
and divide by 165 to get
[```[@($money-2771)/165@] = x ```]
and add this value to 1996 to get that the year the average tuition reached $[$money] is [$year].
