$num = random(1993, 2015);

$W0 = $W->eval(x => $num - 1984);

BEGIN_PGML
The function [` W(x) = [$W] `] models the number of women in millions enrolled in U.S. colleges [`x`] years after 1984.
The function [`M(x)= [$M]`] models the number of men in millions, enrolled in U.S. colleges [`x`] years after 1984.

a) Find the number (in millions) of women enrolled in U.S. colleges in the year [$num].

    Answer: [_]{$W0} million women

b) Find the number (in millions) of men enrolled in U.S. colleges in the year [$num].

    Answer: [_]{$M0} million men

END_PGML

$n = $num - 1984;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
These values are found by first finding [`x`], the number of years that [$num] is after 1984.  This is [`[$num]-1984 = [$n] `].  Then substitute this value into the functions [`W(x)`] and [`M(x)`]:

In [$num] the enrollment in U.S. colleges by gender is:

a) [`0.07([$n])+4.1 = [$W0]`] million women

b) [`0.01([$n])+3.9 = [$M0]`] million men
