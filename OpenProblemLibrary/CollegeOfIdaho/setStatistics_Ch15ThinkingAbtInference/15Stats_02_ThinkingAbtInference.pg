#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A report in a research journal states that the average weight loss of people on a
certain drug is \($xbar\) lbs with a margin of error of \( \pm$marginerr \) lbs with confidence level C = 95%.

$PAR
(a)   According to this information, the mean weight loss of people on this drug,
 \( \mu \), could be as low as \{ans_rule(10)\} lbs. 

$PAR
(b)  If the study is repeated, how large should the sample size be so that the margin of 
error would be less than $marginerr2 lbs?  (Assume \( \sigma = \ $sigma \) lbs.)
$BR
ANSWER: \{ans_rule(10)\}  $BR
