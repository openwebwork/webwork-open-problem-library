BEGIN_PGML

A report in a research journal states that the average decrease in systolic
blood pressure of people on a
certain blood pressure medication is [$xbar] mmHg with a margin of error
of [` \pm[$marginerr]`] mmHg with confidence level C = 95%.

a)   According to this information, the mean decrease in systolic blood
pressure of people on this medication,
 [` \mu `], could be as low as [__]{$ans_a} mmHg.


b)  If the study is repeated, how large should the sample size be so that
the margin of error would be less than [$marginerr2] mmHg?
(Assume [` \sigma =  [$sigma] `] mmHg.)

    ANSWER: [__]{$ans_b}
