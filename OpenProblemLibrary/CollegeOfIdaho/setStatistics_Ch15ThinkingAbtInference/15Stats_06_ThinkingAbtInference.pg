#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The time needed for college students to complete a certain paper-and-pencil maze follows a normal distribution with a mean of 30 seconds and a standard deviation of $sigma seconds.  You wish to see if the mean time \( \mu \) is changed by vigorous exercise, so you have a group of $n college students exercise vigorously for 30  minutes and then complete the maze.  It takes them an average of \( \bar{x} = $mean \) seconds to complete the maze.  Use this information to test the hypotheses
$BR
\( H_0: \mu = 30 \)
$BR
\( H_a: \mu \neq 30 \)
$BR
Conduct a test using a significance level of \(\alpha = $a\).

$PAR
(a)  The test statistic  \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(b) The positive critical value, z* =  \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(c)  \{ $mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
