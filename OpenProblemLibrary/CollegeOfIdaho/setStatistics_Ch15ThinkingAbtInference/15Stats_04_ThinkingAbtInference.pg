       average lifetime of 1200 hours.  The new bulb had a lifetime of 1200.2 hours,

       \(\sigma = 0.1\).  The brand advertises that the mean nicotine content of their 
       cigarettes is 1.5, but you believe that the mean nicotine content is actually 
       higher than advertised.  To explore this, you test the hypotheses
       \(H_0: \mu = 1.5\), \(H_a: \mu > 1.5\) and you obtain a P-value of 0.052.

       improvement in mental performance?  To investigate this issue, a researcher 
       conducted a study with 150 adult subjects who performed aerobic exercise each day 
       for a period of six months.  At the end of the study, 200 variables related to 
       the mental performance of the subjects were measured on each subject and the 
       means compared to known means for these variables in the population of all 
       adults.  Nine of these variables were significantly better (in the sense of 
       statistical significance) at the \(\alpha = 0.05\) level for the group that 
       performed 30 minutes of aerobic exercise each day as compared to the population

       statistical conclusions from studies in which the number of subjects is less than 
       the number of variables measured. ",
