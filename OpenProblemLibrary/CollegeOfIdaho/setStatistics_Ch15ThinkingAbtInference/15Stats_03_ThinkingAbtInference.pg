         test that measures the motivation, attitude, and study habits of college 
         students.  Scores range from 0 to 200 and follow (approximately) a normal 
         distribution with mean 115 and standard deviation \(\sigma = 25\).  You suspect 
         that incoming freshman have a mean \(\mu\) which is different from 115 because
         they are often excited yet anxious about entering college.  To test your 
         suspicion, you test the hypotheses \(H_0: \mu = 115\), \(H_a: \mu \neq 115\).
         You give the SSHA to 25 students who are incoming freshman and find their mean 
         score.  Based on this, you reject \(H_0\) at significance level 
         \(\alpha = 0.01\).  Which of the following would be most helpful in assessing 
         the practical significance of your results?",
