#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The nicotine content in cigarettes of a certain brand is normally distributed with mean (in milligrams) \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 0.1 \). The brand advertises that the mean nicotine content of their cigarettes is 1.5 mg.  Now, suppose a reporter wants to test whether the mean nicotine content is actually higher than advertised.  He takes measurements from a SRS of $n cigarettes of this brand.  The sample yields an average of $mean mg of nicotine. 
Conduct a test using a significance level of \(\alpha = $a\).

$PAR
(a)  The test statistic  \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(b) The critical value, z* = \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(c)  \{ $mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
