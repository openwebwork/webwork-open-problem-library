$BBOLD Note 2: $EBOLD You will need to use parenthesis to let WeBWorK know what is supposed to
be in the numerator and denominator of a fraction.  
$BR $BR
For example, \[ \frac{x^2}{y^4} \] would be OK entered as: x^2/y^4.
$BR However, \[ \frac{a^2}{3b^4}\] would need parenthesis: a^2/(3b^4).  Otherwise, if you type a^2/3b^4,
WeBWorK will think you entered: \[ \frac{a^2}{3} b^4 \].
