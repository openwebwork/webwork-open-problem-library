BEGIN_TEXT
Researchers wish to determine if a new experimental medication will 
reduce the symptoms of allergy sufferers without the side-effect of 
drowsiness.  To investigate this question, the researchers give the 
new medication to 50 adult volunteers who suffer from allergies.  
Forty-four of these volunteers report a significant reduction in their 
allergy symptoms without any drowsiness.
