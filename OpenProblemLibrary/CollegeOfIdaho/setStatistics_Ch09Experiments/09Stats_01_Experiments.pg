#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A group of college students believes that herbal tea has remarkable restorative powers. To test their theory, they make weekly visits to a local nursing home, visiting with residents, talking with them, and serving them herbal tea. After several months, many of the residents are more cheerful and healthy.
