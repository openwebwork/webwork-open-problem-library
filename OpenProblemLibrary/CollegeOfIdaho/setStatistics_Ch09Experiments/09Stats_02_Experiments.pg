BEGIN_PGML
A study of human development showed two types of movies to a group of
children. Crackers were available in a bowl,
and the investigators compared the number of crackers eaten by
the children while watching the different kinds of movies.
One kind was shown at 8 A.M. and another at 11 A.M.
It was found that during the movie shown at 11 A.M.,
more crackers were eaten than during the movie shown at 8 A.M.
The investigators concluded that the different types of movies had
an effect on appetite.
