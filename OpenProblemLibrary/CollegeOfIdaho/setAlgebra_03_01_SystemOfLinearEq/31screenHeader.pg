-Enter each answer as a point: 
$BITALIC (-1,2) $EITALIC
$BR 
-If there are no solutions, type $BITALIC None$EITALIC or
$BITALIC No solution$EITALIC. 
$BR
-If there are infinitely many solutions, 
type $BITALIC x$EITALIC for the \(x\)-coordinate, and an 
expression in terms of $BITALIC x$EITALIC for the \(y\)-coordinate:
$BITALIC (x, 3x-1)$EITALIC.
