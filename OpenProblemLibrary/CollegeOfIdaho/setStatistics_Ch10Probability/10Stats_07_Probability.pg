At a certain high school, if a student is selected at random and asked what they plan to
do after graduating, the probability distribution for their response is given above, 
determine the following: 

$PAR
(a) \( \) $sevent[0] \(=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(b) \( \) $sevent[1] \(=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(c) \( \) $sevent[2] \(=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}
