#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The length, \(X\), of a fish from a particular mountain lake in Idaho is normally
distributed with \(\mu = $mu\) inches and \(\sigma = $sigma\) inches.

$PAR
(a)  Is \(X\) a discrete or continuous random variable? (Type: DISCRETE or CONTINUOUS)
$BR
ANSWER: \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR
(b)   Write the event ''$event[$choose]'' in terms of \(X\): \{ans_rule(20)\}.

$PAR
(c)  Find the probability of this event: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR

$PAR
(d)    Find the probability that the length of a chosen fish was greater than $length2 inches: \{ans_rule(15)\}.

$PAR
(e)    Find the probability that the length of a chosen fish was between $length1 and $length2 inches: \{ans_rule(15)\}.
