#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
The score on an exam from a certain statistics class, \(X\), is normally
distributed with \(\mu = $mu\) and \(\sigma = $sigma\).
$BR
$BR
NOTE: Assume for the sake of this problem that the score is a continuous variable.  A score can thus take on any value on the continuum.  (In real life, scores are often treated as if they were continuous values but are actually discrete in most cases.)

$PAR
(a)   Write the event ''$event[$choose]'' in terms of \(X\): \{ans_rule(20)\}.

$PAR
(b)  Find the probability of this event: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR

$PAR
(c)    Find the probability that a randomly chosen score is greater than $score2: \{ans_rule(15)\}.

$PAR
(d)    Find the probability that a randomly chosen score is between $score1 and $score2: \{ans_rule(15)\}.
