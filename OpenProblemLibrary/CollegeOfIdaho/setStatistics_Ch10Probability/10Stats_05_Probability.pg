#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Government data assign a single cause for each death that occurs in the United States.
In a certain city, the data show that the probability is $a that a randomly chosen death 
was due to cardiovascular (mainly heart) disease, and $b that it was due to cancer.

$PAR
(a)    The probability that a death was due either to cardiovascular disease
or to cancer is \{ans_rule(15)\}.

$PAR
(b)    The probability that the death was due to some other cause is  \{ans_rule(15)\}.
