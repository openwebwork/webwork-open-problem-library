BEGIN_PGML
[$p] wants to determine a [$level[$choose]] percent confidence interval
for the true proportion [`p`] of high school students in the area who attend
their home basketball games. Out of [`n`] randomly selected students,
[$p->they] [$p->verb('find')]
that exactly half attend their home basketball games.  About how large
would [`n`] have to be to get a margin of error less than [$m] for [`p`]?

*Note: Use the values for [`z^{\star}`] from  a z-table or t-table,
and round to the smallest integer that works.*

[`n \approx`] [______]{$ans}
