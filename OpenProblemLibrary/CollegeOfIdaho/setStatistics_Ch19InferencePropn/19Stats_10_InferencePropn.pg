#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A noted psychic was tested for ESP.  The psychic was presented with 
$n[$choose] cards face down and was asked to determine if the card was one of 
5 symbols: a star, cross, circle, square, or three wavy lines.  The psychic 
was correct in $x[$choose] cases.  Let \(p\) represent the probability that 
the psychic correctly identifies the symbol on the card in a random trial.  
Assume the $n[$choose] trials can be treated as an SRS from the population of 
all guesses.

$BR
To see if there is evidence that the psychic is doing better than just 
guessing, we test
$BCENTER
\(  H_0: p = .2 \) 
$BR
\(  H_a: p > .2 \)
$ECENTER

$PAR
(a) What is the \(z\)-statistic for this test? \(  \)
\{ ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b) What is the P-value of the test?  \(  \)
\{ ans_rule(10)\}
