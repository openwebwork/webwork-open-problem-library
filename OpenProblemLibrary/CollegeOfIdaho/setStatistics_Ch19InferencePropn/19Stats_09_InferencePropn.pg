#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A newspaper conducted a statewide survey concerning the 1998 
race for state senator.  The newspaper took a SRS of \( n = 
$n[$choose] \) registered voters 
and found that $x[$choose] would vote for the Republican candidate.  Let \(p\) 
represent the proportion of registered voters in the state who would vote for 
the Republican candidate. 

$BR
We test

$BCENTER
\(  H_0: p = .50 \) 
$BR
\( H_a: p > .50\)
$ECENTER

$PAR
(a) What is the \(z\)-statistic for this test? \(  \)
\{ ans_rule(10)\}

$PAR
(b) What is the P-value of the test?  \(  \)
\{ ans_rule(10)\}
