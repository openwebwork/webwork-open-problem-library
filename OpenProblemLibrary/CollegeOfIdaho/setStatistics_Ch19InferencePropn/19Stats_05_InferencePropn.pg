#  Setup

@name = ("Pedro", "Julia", "Matt", "Albert");
$m= random(0,3,1);
$pronoun = "he";
if ($m==1) {$pronoun = "she";}
$s = random(1,6,1);
@n = (30,34,38,42,46,50);
@x = (6,7,8,9,10,11);

#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
 $name[$m] thinks that $pronoun has a special relationship with the number $s. 
In particular, $name[$m] thinks that $pronoun would roll a $s with a fair 
6-sided die more often than you'd expect by chance alone.  Suppose \(p\) is 
the true proportion of the time $name[$m] will roll a $s.    

$PAR
(a) State the null and alternative hypotheses for testing $name[$m]'s claim.
(Type the symbol "p" for the population proportion, whichever symbols you need 
of "<", ">", "=", "not =" and express any values as a fraction e.g.  $BBOLD p = 
1/3$EBOLD)
$BR
  \(  H_0\) = \{ ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
  \(  H_a\) = \{ ans_rule(15)\}
END_TEXT

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
(b) Now suppose $name[$m] makes n = $n[$choose] rolls, and a $s comes up 
$x[$choose] times out of the $n[$choose] rolls.  Determine the P-value of the 
test: 
$BR
P-value = \{ ans_rule(10) \} 

$PAR
(c) Answer the question: Does this sample provide evidence at the 5 percent level 
that $name[$m] rolls a $s more often than you'd expect? 
$BR
(Type: Yes or No) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
