WeBWorK is a little cranky about scoring factoring problems, 
so you will need to enter your answers following these rules:
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 1: $EBOLD Do not use unnecessary parentheses within a
factor.  Only parentheses will be accepted--no brackets or braces.
$BR
Correct: $BITALIC 5x(2x^2+1) $EITALIC
$BR
Incorrect (unnecessary parentheses): $BITALIC 5x(2(x^2-1)+3) $EITALIC
$BR 
Incorrect (brackets/braces): $BITALIC 5x[2x^2+1] $EITALIC
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 2: $EBOLD If your answer has a monomial factor, then it should
be the first factor in your answer or enclosed with parentheses:
$BR
Correct: $BITALIC 4x(x+y)(2x-5y) $EITALIC
$BR
Correct: $BITALIC (x+y)(2x-5y)(4x) $EITALIC
$BR
Incorrect: $BITALIC (x+y)(2x-5y)4x $EITALIC
$BR
Incorrect: $BITALIC x(x+y)(2x-5y)(4) $EITALIC
