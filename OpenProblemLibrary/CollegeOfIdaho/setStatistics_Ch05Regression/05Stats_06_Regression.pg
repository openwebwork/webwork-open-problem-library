BEGIN_PGML
Is the number of games won by a softball team in a season related
to the team batting average?  The table below shows the batting average (in thousandths) and the number of games won of 8 teams.

[@ DataTable(\@rows,
    padding => [0.25, 0.25], horizontalrules => 1, align => '|c|c|c|' ) @]*

Using games won as the explanatory variable [`x`], do the following:

a) The correlation coefficient is [`r = `][_____]{$ans_a}

b) The equation of the least squares line is [`\hat{y} = `][___]{$ans_b}
