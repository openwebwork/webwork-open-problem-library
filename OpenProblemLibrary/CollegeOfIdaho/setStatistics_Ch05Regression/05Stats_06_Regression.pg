BEGIN_PGML
Is the number of games won by a softball team in a season related
to the team batting average?  The table below shows the batting average (in thousandths) and the number of games won of 8 teams.

[@ DataTable(\@rows,
    padding => [0.25, 0.25], horizontalrules => 1, align => '|c|c|c|' ) @]*

Using batting average as the explanatory variable [`x`], and games won as the response variable [`y`], do the following:

a) Find the correlation coefficient [`r = `][_____]{$ans_a}

b) Find the equation of the least squares line [`\hat{y} = `][___]{$ans_b}

What do you think?  In this case was a higher batting average associated with winning more games, or were other things involved?
