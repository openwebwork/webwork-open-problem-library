BEGIN_PGML
Is the number of games won by a softball team in a season related
to the team batting average?  The table below shows the batting average (in thousandths) and the number of games won of 8 teams.

[# [. Team .] [. Batting Average .] [. Games Won .]*{headerrow => 1}
   [. .]{rows => ~~@rows}
#]

Using batting average as the explanatory variable [`x`], and games won as the response variable [`y`], do the following:

a) Find the correlation coefficient [`r = `][_____]{$ans_a}

b) Find the equation of the least squares line [`\hat{y} = `][___]{$ans_b}

What do you think?  In this case was a higher batting average associated with winning more games, or were other things involved?
