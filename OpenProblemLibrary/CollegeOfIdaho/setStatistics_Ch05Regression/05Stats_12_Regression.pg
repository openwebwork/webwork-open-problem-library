    qq/The owner of a chain  of supermarkets notices that there is a positive
     correlation between the sales of beer and the sales of ice cream over
     the course of the previous year.  Seasons when sales of beer were above
     average, sales of ice cream also tended to be above average.  Likewise,
     during seasons when sales of beer were below	average, sales of ice cream
     also tended to be below average.  Which of the following would be a valid
     conclusion from these facts?/,
    qq/A researcher observes that, on average, the number of children in
     cities with major league baseball	teams is larger than in cities without
     major league baseball teams.  The most plausible explanation for	this

        ice cream causes a thirst for beer./,

          of more major league baseball teams (more children means
          potentially more fans at the ballpark since people like to bring
          their kids to baseball games, thus making it attractive for an
          owner to relocate to such cities)./,
