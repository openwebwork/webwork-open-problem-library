#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Shelia's doctor is concerned that she may suffer from gestational diabetes
(high blood glucose levels during pregnancy).  There is variation both in the actual
glucose level and in the blood test that measures the level. A patient is classified
as having gestational diabetes if the glucose level is above 140 milligrams per
deciliter one hour after a sugary drink is ingested.  Shelia's measured glucose 
level one hour after ingesting the sugary drink varies according to the Normal 
distribution with mean $mu mg/dl and standard deviation $sigma mg/dl.  Let \(L\)
denote a patient's glucose level. 

$PAR
(a)  If measurements are made on $n[$choose] different days, find the level \( L\)
such that there is probability only $p that the mean glucose level of $n[$choose]
test results falls above \( L \) for Shelia's glucose level distribution.  What is
the value of \( L \)?
$BR
 ANSWER: \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
(b)  If the mean result from the $n[$choose] tests
is compared to the criterion 140 mg/dl, what is the probability that 
Shelia is diagnosed as having gestational diabetes?
$BR
 ANSWER: \{ans_rule(10)\}
