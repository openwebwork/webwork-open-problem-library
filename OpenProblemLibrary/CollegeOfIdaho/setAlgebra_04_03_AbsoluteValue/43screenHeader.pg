$BBOLD Instructions: $EBOLD
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 1:$EBOLD  Enter answers with the variable in the problem: 
$BITALIC x=-3$EITALIC.  
$BR
If your answer consists of more than one number 
as the solution to the problem, 
$BR
using the variable in the problem, 
$BR
enter: $BITALIC x=2 or x=5 $EITALIC
or, 
$BR
enter your answer as a set:  $BITALIC {2, 5}$EITALIC
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 2:$EBOLD  On this assignment you may use either interval 
notation or inequality signs.  $
PAR
$BBOLD Note 3:$EBOLD  To enter \(\infty\) in WeBWorK, type: $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC
and for \(-\infty\) type: $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 4:$EBOLD If the answer is the empty set, type: $BITALIC NONE $EITALIC
$BR  
If the answer is all real numbers, type: $BITALIC All real numbers $EITALIC
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 5:$EBOLD  To enter two intervals/inequalities for an answer, 
type $BITALIC U $EITALIC (union) for intervals and $BITALIC or $EITALIC 
for inequalities.  
$BR For interval notation: \((-\infty, a)\) $BITALIC U$EITALIC \([b,\infty)\).  
$BR For inequalities: \(x < a\) $BITALIC or $EITALIC \( x \geq b\).
