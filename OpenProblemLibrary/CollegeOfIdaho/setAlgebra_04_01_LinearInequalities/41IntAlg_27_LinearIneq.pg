$year = random(2006,2012,2);  #Define this here to get a nice answer
$year0 = random(1999,2002,1);
$m = random(2.2,3.5,.1);

BEGIN_TEXT
For a certain county, the percentage, \(P\), of voters who used
electronic voting systems, such as optical scans, in national
elections can be modeled by the formula
\[ P = $m x + $b, \]
where \(x\) is the number of years after $year0.  In which years
will more than $percent$PERCENT of the county's voters use
electronic systems?
$BR
Note: Enter your answer as, $BITALIC Voting years after yyyy $EITALIC-- do not put a period at the end of the phrase.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(35) \}
