#  Main

BEGIN_TEXT
A marketing research firm wishes to determine if the residents of Caldwell, Idaho, would be interested in a new downtown restaurant. The firm selects a simple random sample of $n1 phone numbers from the Caldwell phone book and calls each household. Only $n2 of those called are willing to participate in the survey, and $n3 participants would support a new downtown restaurant.
