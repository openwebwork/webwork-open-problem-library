#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose a group of $n smokers (who all wanted to give up smoking) were randomly assigned to receive an
antidepressant drug or a placebo for six weeks.  Of the $n1 patients who received the
antidepressant drug, $x1 were not smoking one year later.  Of the $n2 patients who
received the placebo, $x2 were not smoking one year later.  Given the null hypothesis \( H_0:
(p_{drug} - p_{placebo}) = 0 \) and the alternative hypothesis 
\( H_a: (p_{drug} - p_{placebo}) \ne 0 \), conduct a test to see
if taking an antidepressant drug can help smokers stop smoking.  
Use \( \alpha = $alpha \),

$PAR
(a)  The test statistic is \{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR
(b)  The P-value is \{ans_rule(20)\} 

$PAR
(c) \{ $mc->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}$PAR
