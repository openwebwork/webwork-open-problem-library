BEGIN_TEXT
Independent random samples, each containing $n observations, were selected from two 
populations.  The samples from populations 1 and 2 produced $x1 and $x2 successes,
respectively. $BR
Test \(H_0: (p_1 - p_2) = 0\) against \(H_a: (p_1 - p_2) > 0\). Use \(\alpha = $alpha\) 

$PAR
 (a) The test statistic is \{ans_rule(20)\}
