#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
With the current, you can canoe $miles miles in $hrWithCurrent 
hours.  Against the same current, you can canoe only $fraction[$n]
of this distance in $hrAgainstCurrent hours.  For the following 
problems, use \(x\) for the rate you canoe in still water 
and \(y\) for the rate of the current.
$PAR 
a) Write a mathematical expression for the distance you
can canoe with the current.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$PAR
b) Write a mathematical expression for the distance you
can canoe against the current.
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}
$PAR
c) What is the rate of the $items[$choose]? (Note: The rate is
measured in miles per hour: $BITALIC mph $EITALIC)
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(15) \}

#  Note:  The equation checker is not too picky.
