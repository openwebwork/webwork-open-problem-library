BEGIN_TEXT

An elementary school sells tickets to the school play to raise money for new 

playground equipment.  A total of $numTotal tickets are sold with 

ticket prices of $DOLLAR$prices[0] per adult and $DOLLAR$prices[1] per child.

The school raised $DOLLAR$moneyTotal from ticket sales. For the 
following problems, Use \(x\) for the number of adults and \(y\) 
for the number of children.

$PAR

a) Write an equation that shows how \(x\) and \(y\) are related to the total number  of tickets sold.  The total number of tickets sold should be the right hand side of your equation.   

$BR

Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}

$PAR

b) Write an equation that shows how \(x\) and \(y\) are related to the total number of dollars earned from the ticket sales.  The total number of dollars earned should be the right hand side of your equation.  
$BR

Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \}

$PAR

c) How many $items[$choose] attended the play?

$BR

Answer:  \{ans_rule(15) \}

#  Answer
#  Note:  The equation checker is not too picky.
#         This should be changed to a MathObject format.


$ans_a = "x + y = $numTotal";
