#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Video Store A charges $DOLLAR$a to rent a video game for one week.
Although only members can rent from the store, membership is free.
Video Store B charges only $DOLLAR$b to rent a video game for one 
week.  Only members can rent from the store and membership is 
$DOLLAR$c per year.  After how many video game rentals will the 
total amount spent at each store be the same?
$PAR
a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let $BITALIC x $EITALIC 
represent the number of video game rentals.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) Solve your equation to answer the question. (Note: Your answer should
be in the form $BITALIC 29 rentals.$EITALIC)
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
