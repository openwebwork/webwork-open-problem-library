$BBOLD Note 1:$EBOLD Some of the problems require units, i.e. if the problem
asks for the number of radios to meet the condition given,
then you need to enter $BITALIC nn radios$EITALIC where
$BITALIC nn$EITALIC is the number of radios.
$PAR
$BBOLD Note 2: $EBOLD When you use fractions, you may need to put parenthesis
around the numerator and/or the denominator for WeBWorK. For example,
\[ \frac{xy}{2z} \] should be typed in as: (xy)/(2z).
