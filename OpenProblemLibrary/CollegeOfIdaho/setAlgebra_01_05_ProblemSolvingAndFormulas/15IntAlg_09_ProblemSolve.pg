#  Setup

$a = list_random(5,8);
$answer = random(120,250,10);
$b = $answer*(1+$a/100);

#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Including $a$PERCENT sales tax, an inn charges $price per night.
Find the nightly cost at the inn before tax is added.
$PAR
a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let $BITALIC x $EITALIC 
represent the nightly cost before tax.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) Solve the equation to find nightly cost before tax. (Note: Your answer should
be in the form $BITALIC $DOLLAR$string.$EITALIC)
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
