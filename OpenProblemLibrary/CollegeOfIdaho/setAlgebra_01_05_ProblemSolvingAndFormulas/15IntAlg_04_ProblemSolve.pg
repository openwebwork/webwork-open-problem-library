#  Setup

$year = random(1980,2020,10);
$n = 55 + 0.2*($year-1900);

#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
According to one mathematical model, the average life expenctancy for American
men born in 1900 was 55 years. Life expectancy has increased by about 0.2 year
for each birth year after 1900.  If this trend continues, for which birth year
will the average life expentancy be $n years?
$PAR
a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let $BITALIC t $EITALIC represent
the number of years after 1900.  For example, $BITALIC t = 12 $EITALIC would 
represent the year 1912.
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) Solve the equation, then answer the question given above. (Note: You are asked for a year, not a value for $BITALIC t.$EITALIC)
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
