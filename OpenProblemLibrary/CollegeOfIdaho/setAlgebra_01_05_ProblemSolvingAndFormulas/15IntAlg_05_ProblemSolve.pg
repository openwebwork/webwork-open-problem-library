#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
In 2003, the price of a certain automobile was approximately 
$showPrice with a depreciation of $showa per year.  After how many
years will the car's value be $showb?
$PAR
a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let $BITALIC t $EITALIC 
represent the number of years after 2003.  For example, the year 2005
would be represented by $BITALIC t = 2. $EITALIC
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
b) Solve the equation to find the answer to the question above.
(Note:  Include the units, in this case $BITALIC years.$EITALIC)
$BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
