$BBOLD$BITALIC Problem Statement: $EBOLD$EITALIC$BR
The load applied between A and B has the profile of a quarter circle. For the dimensions and load values given above, find:$BR
\(\bullet\)$SPACE the magnitude of the overall force applied to the beam, and,$BR
\(\bullet\)$SPACE the$BITALIC x$EITALIC location where the overall distributed load may be concentrated so as to cause the same support reactions.
