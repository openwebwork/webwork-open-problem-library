adhesive strips 01
$PAR
Parts A and B are connected with two adhesive strips (one is shown, and another one mirrors it on the bottom side of the assembly). The shearing stress in the adhesive must be limited to $SS kPa, and the normal stress in the adhesive strip must be limited to $NS MPa. The dimensions of the assembly are:
$PAR
a = $a mm $BR
b = $b mm $BR
c = $c mm $BR
d = $d mm $BR
h = $h mm $BR
t = $t mm
$PAR
Find the maximum axial force, F, that can be applied to the assembly.

$PAR
