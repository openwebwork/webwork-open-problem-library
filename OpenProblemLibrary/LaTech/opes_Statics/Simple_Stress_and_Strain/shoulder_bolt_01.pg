This shoulder bolt is composed of hot-rolled monel. The head of the shoulder bolt is a regular hexagon and it measures $dh mm across opposite flats. The other dimensions of the bolt are given below, as well as the forces to which this component is subjected. Find the change in length of each segment of the part as well as the overall change in length from A to D.
