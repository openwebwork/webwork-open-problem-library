slip coupling 01
$PAR
Two rods are connected with a slip coupling and adhesive in the annuli. The diameters of the rods are \(d_1\) = $d1 inches and \(d_2\) = $d2 inches. The connection must support an axial force of F = $F lb. If the average stress in the adhesive must not exceed $SS psi, find the necessary depths of insertion of each rod (i.e. dimensions a and b). Assume no bonding occurs on the flat ends of the rods.
