stress strain curve 01
$PAR
The following stress-strain curve was prepared based on a tensile test of a specimen that had a circular cross-section.  The gage diameter of the specimen was $d inches and the gage length was $L inches. The stress scale of the stress-strain diagram is given with the factor a = $a ksi. Estimate:
$PAR
(a) The modulus of elasticity.$BR
(b) The ultimate strength.$BR
(c) The yield strength (0.2% offset).$BR
(d) The percent elongation at fracture.$BR
