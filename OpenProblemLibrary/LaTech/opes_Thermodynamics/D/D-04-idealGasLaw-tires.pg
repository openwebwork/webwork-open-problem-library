"Burnout" is a technique commonly used in drag racing. It is done by holding the car stationary and spinning the rear tires against the ground in order to heat them up. Since hot tire rubber has a higher coefficient of friction that cold rubber, drivers will perform a burnout just prior to the start of a race. Doing so will enable faster acceleration without slippage. However, tire pressure is another critical factor that can affect performance. 

$PAR

For a particular track, the optimum pressure has been determined to be $bestpressure psi (as measured by a tire gage). If a particular burnout maneuver will increase the temperature of the rear tires by $TEMPERATURECHANGE \(^\circ\)F above their original temperature of $outsidetemp \(^\circ\)F, to what air pressure should the tires be initially inflated? (Assume the volume of the tire does not change with pressure.)
