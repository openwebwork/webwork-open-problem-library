## NOTES : This is a throttling process, with R-134a as the working fluid. 
## The solution process is largely a matter of identifying the initial 
## enthalpy, then scanning through the table for the final pressure until 
## the bounding values can be found. Interpolation is required to obtain the
## final specific volume and the final temperature.
