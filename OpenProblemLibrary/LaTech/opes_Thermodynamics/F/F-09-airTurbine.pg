$PAR

Air is used as the working fluid in a turbine. At the inlet, the air is at $T1 K, $P1 kPa. It is flowing at a rate of $mDot kg/s, having a velocity of $velocity1 m/s. At the outlet, the air is $T2 K, $P2 kPa, and flowing at $velocity2 m/s. Assuming that the specific heat of the air is constant during the process, what is the power output of the turbine in MW? $PAR
