$PAR

An adiabatic heat exchanger is used to heat liquid oil (c<sub>p</sub> = 0.430 Btu/lbm*R) at $Toil1 \(^\circ\)F entering at a rate of $mDot_oil lbm/s with hot air entering at $Tair1 \(^\circ\)F at a rate of $mDot_air lbm/s. If the exit temperature of the oil is $Toil2 \(^\circ\)F, then what is the exit temperature in \(^\circ\)F of the air? $PAR

<u>Assume the following constant properties for air: </u> 
$PAR
c<sub>v</sub> = 0.185 Btu/lbm*R
$PAR
c<sub>p</sub> = 0.254 Btu/lbm*R
