## NOTES : This manometer includes three fluids and two 
## pressure vessels (no ambient pressure). A little extraneous 
## information is given and one fluid has even heights on each side. 
## Therefore, alert students will be able to solve this in fewer steps. 
## Hasty students may also forget that kg*m/s^2 is Pa, not kPa. 
## This mistake will result in very high pressure differentials.
