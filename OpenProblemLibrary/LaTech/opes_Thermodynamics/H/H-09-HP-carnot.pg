$PAR
A Carnot heat pump is used to maintain the temperature inside a building at $TH_C \(^\circ\)C. Significantly, the colder it gets outside, the more heat is lost through the walls and windows of the building. Assume that $QH kW of heat are lost for each degree difference between the outside and the inside temperature. That means that the colder it gets, the harder the heat pump will need to work. However, for safety reasons, the controller circuit for the heat pump limits its electrical power consumption to $Win kW. What's the coldest it can get outside before the heat pump can't maintain the building temperature adequately? $PAR
