You have taken another winter trip. Wisely, you lowered the thermostat setpoint temperature while you were away. Upon arriving home, you increase the thermostat temperature. Your baseboard (resistance coil) heater turns on and remains on. Assume that the room is sealed, so that no air can leak in or out. Consider only the air in the room (total air mass is $massAir kg) and not the furnishings. If the heater is rated at $heaterPower W, what will be the temperature rise, in degrees Celsius, after $heaterTime minutes?
