## The two critical knowns at (2) are the specific volume and the

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR

An insulated rigid tank contains a saturated liquid-vapor mix of water initially at a pressure of $P1 kPa. The mass of the mixture is $mass kg, but only $liquidPercent \(%\) of the total mass is liquid. An electric resistance heater is turned on within the tank until all the water has vaporized. The heater power is a constant $heaterPower kW.
