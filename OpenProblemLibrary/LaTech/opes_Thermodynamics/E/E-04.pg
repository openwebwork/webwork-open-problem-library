## NOTES : This is a polytropic compression problem. There is 
## boundary work (-) and internal energy change (+). The resulting 
## heat will be either + or -, depending on the random variables 
## selected. Hasty students may ignore the signs and arrive at an 
## incorrect solution. Also, the given temperatures are in Celsius, 
## but must be converted to Kelvin for the ideal gas law calculations.

$PAR

Air in a piston-cylinder device is compressed from an initial state (temperature = $T1 \(^\circ\)C, pressure = $P1 kPa, volume = $V1 m\(^3\)) to a final state (temperature = $T2 \(^\circ\)C, pressure = $P2 kPa), during a polytropic process (n = $nProcess). What is the heat transfer associated with this process in kJ? (Remember, heat in is postive, heat out is negative.)
