## NOTES : This problem has the students evaluating the work produced 
## by a cycle that contains an isothermal, an isochoric, and an isobaric 
## process. They aren't taking this to the level that they will in later 
## sections. Rather, they are just approaching it from a boundary work 
## standpoint. There are many steps to get to the answer of "What is the 
## work per cycle?" that is most relevant. To help the students, the 
## intermediate steps are broken out so that they can check their answers 
## along the way.

$PAR

Air in a piston/cylinder device undergoes a continuous cycle as shown here: from State 1 to State 2 to State 3 to State 1 to State 2, etc... The air cycles between two pressures $Plow kPa and $Phi kPa and two specific volumes. The first process in the cycle (1 - 2) is an isothermal process at $T12 K. Determine the following.
