$PAR

An electric motor converts electricity to rotating shaft work with an efficiency of $ELECEFFICIENCY%. The rotating shaft turns the impeller in the pump which, in turn, increases the pressure of the water (\( \displaystyle \rho=1000 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}\)) by $pressureincrease kPa. If the motor is consuming $elecpower kW of electricity, and water flow through the pump is $WATERFLOW \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{L}}{\text{s}}\) (at a constant velocity), what is the mechanical efficiency with which the pump converts the rotation of the impeller into water pressure? **Note: You may ignore any changes in potential energy.
