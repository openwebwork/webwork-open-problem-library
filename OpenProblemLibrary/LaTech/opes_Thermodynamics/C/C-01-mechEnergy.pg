As a pickup truck (total mass of $mass kg, including fuel and driver) approaches a rise in an otherwise flat road, the driver presses the clutch and begins to coast. Initially, the truck was moving at $INITVELOCITY \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}\). For many reasons, including friction losses, the truck has slowed to $finalvelocity \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}\) upon reaching the top of the rise (the change in elevation was $elevation m). What was the total change in the mechanical energy of the truck in kJ? (Hint: it may be negative.)
