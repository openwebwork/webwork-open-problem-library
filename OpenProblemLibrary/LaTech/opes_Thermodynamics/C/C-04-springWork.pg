## NOTES : This problem introduces spring work. This will be useful, 
## as spring work appears occasionally in many different Thermodynamics 
## scenarios. This is in US units, which will require some attention 
## with the conversion factors.

Combustion in a cylinder causes the pressure to increase, which moves the piston a distance (\(x\)) of $DISTANCE inches. The piston is held in place by a spring ( \(\displaystyle k = $SPRINGCONSTANT \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}}\)) that was at its relaxed length before the combustion process. How much work did the expansion process do on the piston in Btu?
