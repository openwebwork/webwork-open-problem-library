## NOTES : This problem requires the students to use 
## (density) x (area) x (velocity) to calculate the mass flow rate 
## for a wind turbine. The rest of the formula for energy is 
## straightforward. Students will then need to compare the kWh from 
## the wind turbine with kWh usage from a residential home.

The USEIA reported that in 2011, the average American household consumed 11,280 kWh for the year. On the outskirts of a small city, an energy company has constructed a single, large wind turbine (blade diameter $diameter m). A typical average wind speed over any 24-hour period is $AIRVELOCITY \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}\). Assuming perfect energy conversion, how many households will that one installation serve? (Air density is $density \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}\).)
