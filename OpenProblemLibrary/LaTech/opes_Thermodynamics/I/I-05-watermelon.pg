$PAR
The morning before a party, you take a $mass kg watermelon with specific heat $cp kJ/(kg K) out of the refrigerator. When you set it on the counter, the watermelon is initially at $T1_C \(^\circ\)C and the kitchen is at room temperature ($T2_C \(^\circ\)C). After a while, the watermelon has completely warmed up. What is the total entropy associated with this heat transfer process? $PAR
\{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR
