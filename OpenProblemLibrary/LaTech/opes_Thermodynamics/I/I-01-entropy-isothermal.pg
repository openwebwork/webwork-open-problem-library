$PAR

A heat engine operates between thermal reservoirs of $TH K and $TL K. The engine produces $Wout kW of work, and has a thermal efficiency of $ETA_percent%. $PAR

(a) What is the rate of entropy change associated with the heat transfer into the engine? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR

(b) What is the rate of entropy change associated with the heat transfer from the engine to the sink? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR

(c) What is the total rate of entropy generation caused by this engine? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR

(d) If this were a carnot heat engine instead, what would be the rate of entropy change associated with the heat transfer into the engine? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR

(e) If this were a carnot heat engine, what would be the rate of entropy change associated with the heat transfer to the sink? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR

(f) If this were a carnot heat engine, what would be the total entropy generation caused by its operation? $PAR
 \{ ans_rule(10)\} \(\displaystyle \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{K}} \) $PAR
