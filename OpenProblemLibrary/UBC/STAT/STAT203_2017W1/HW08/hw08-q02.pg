Do you ever wonder how email spam filters work? In simple terms,
algorithms are developed to screen incoming emails. Each email message
is assigned a spam score (based on whether certain spammy words are
present and their positions / occurrences in relation to other words in the
message). You can think of the score as a measure of how likely a message
is a spam. A threshold is chosen such that messages whose spam score
exceeds the threshold will be classified as spams. Otherwise, the messages
are classified as non-spams (or "ham"). Effective spam filters have low
false positive (non-spam misclassified as spam) and low false negative
(spam misclassified as non-spam) rates. Spam filtering methods are based
on probability and statistical theories.

For any incoming email message, it can be a true spam or a non-spam, but
we cannot predict its kind with certainty until the message arrives. This is
an example of a random phenomenon.
$BR

Consider a spam filter used to screen 1000 incoming email messages:
$BCENTER
$BR
\(
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & \text{True Spam} & \text{True non-spam} & \text{Total} \\ \hline
\text{Classified as spam} & $x1 & $x3 & $ncspam \\     
\text{Classified as non-spam} & $x2 & $x4 & $ncnonspam \\ \hline
 & $ntspam & $ntnonspam & 1000 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\)
$BR
$ECENTER
An email message is randomly chosen from the 1000 messages. What is
the probability that

it is a spam? Please round your answer to three decimal place.

$BBOLD Part b $EBOLD
$BR
it is classified incorrectly? Please round your answer to three decimal place. 
$BR
\{ ans_rule(9) \}

$BBOLD Part c $EBOLD

What is the false positive rate (i.e. the probability that a non-spam is
misclassified as spam)? Please round your answer to three decimal place.
