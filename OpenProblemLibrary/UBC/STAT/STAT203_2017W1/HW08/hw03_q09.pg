###Random number generator seed based on student's login. No need to change.

BEGIN_TEXT
A computer software company has submitted bids on two separate government contracts, A and B. The company estimates that it has a $xx[0] percent chance of winning contract A and a $yy[0] percent chance of winning contract B. The company believes that winning contract A is independent of winning contract B. Answer the following questions, rounding your answers to two decimal places where appropriate.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD(a) $EBOLD What is the probability that the company will win both contracts?
\{ans_rule(7) \} 
$BR

$BBOLD(b) $EBOLD What is the probability that the company will win at least one of
the two contracts? \{ans_rule(7) \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION

Define the events A = {Company wins contract A} and
B = {Company wins contract B}. Initially these events are assumed independent. 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The event is the intersection of A and B; and if independent
this has probability \( P(A) \times P(B) = $x[0] \times $y[0] =$q1[0] \). 
$BR  
$BR
$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The event is question is the union of A and B, having probability \( P(A) + P(B) -P(A~\text{and}~B) = $x[0] + $y[0] -$x[0] \times $y[0] =$q2[0] \).  
$BR  
$BR
$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD It is now assumed that the events A and B are not independent, with the event A given B (denoted {A|B}) having probability $z[0]. The probability of A and B is therefore \( P(A~\text{and}~B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)= $z[0] \times $y[0]  =$q3[0] \). 
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (d) $EBOLD The event is question is the union of A and B, now having
probability \( P(A) + P(B) -P(A~\text{and}~B) = $x[0] + $y[0] -$z[0] \times $y[0] =$q4[0] \).
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD (e) $EBOLD We know that given contract B is won, the probability of winning contract A is $z[0]. Therefore, given that contract B is won, the probability of not winning contract A must be 1-$z[0]= $q5[0].
