In a large city, 37${PERCENT} of all restaurants accept both master and visa credit cards,
and 50${PERCENT} accept master cards and 60${PERCENT} accept visa cards.
A tourist visiting the city picks at random a restaurant at which to
have lunch. Define the following events:
$BR
\(M\) = {the randomly chosen restaurant accepts master credit cards},$BR
\(V\) = {the randomly chosen restaurant accepts visa credit cards}.$BR
