## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The Binomial distribution is taken to model the number of
"successes" in a sequence of independent trials, each of which may be
either a "success" or a "failure". In this case, "success" is defined as
a person owning a cell phone.
