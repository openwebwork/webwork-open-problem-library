## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects (Required)


###Random number generator seed based on student's login. No need to change.
Context("Numeric");
# warn("Student name: $studentName, login: $studentLogin, id: $studentID");
my $hash = crypt($studentLogin, 'a1');
# warn("crypt: $hash");
@nums = (0..9,'a'..'z','A'..'Z');
my %nums = map { $nums[$_] => $_ } 0..$#nums;
my $seed = 0;
$seed = $seed * 62 + $nums{$_} foreach split(//, substr($hash, -5, 5));
##warn("seed: " . $seed);

####Call R server
rserve_eval("set.seed($seed)"); ## can not combine with the rest

@p1=rserve_eval('
x <-rnorm(n=100, mean=25, sd=10)
x1 <- x[x<10]
x2 <- x[10<x & x<20]
x3 <- x[20<x & x<30]
x4 <- x[30<x & x<40]

');

@p2=rserve_eval('

');

');

@p5=rserve_eval('
p5 <- round(1- (p1+p2+p3+p4), 2)

$q3ans = 1-$p4[0]-$p5[0];

####
$mc1 = new_multiple_choice( );
$mc1 -> qa( "Are A and B mutually exclusive?" , "Yes");
$mc1 -> extra("No");

###
$mc2 = new_multiple_choice( );
$mc2 -> qa( "Are A and B collectively exhaustive?" , "No");
$mc2 -> extra("Yes");

####Build table
$Table =

\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Rate of return}~% & \text{Probability}  \\

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The probability of A is found by summing the probabilities of
the disjoint events that comprise A. We see that A is the union of {Return between 10% and 20%} and {Return > 20%}. Adding the corresponding probabilities we find
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\( 
p(A)=$p4[0]+$p5[0]
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR   

$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD The probability of B is found by summing the probabilities of
the disjoint events that comprise B: We see that B is the union of {Return between 0% and Â10%} and {Return <Â10%}. Adding the corresponding probabilities we Âfind 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\( 
p(B)=$p1[0]+$p2[0]
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD The complement of an event A is the event that A does not occur. We fiÂnd the probability of the complement of an event A by subtracting from unity the probability of the event A: In this case, we have \(1-($p4[0]+$p5[0]). \)
$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (d) $EBOLD As events A and B are disjoint, they cannot both occur so the probability of their intersection is 0.

$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (e) $EBOLD As events A and B are disjoint, the probability of their union is
the sum of their probabilities, this being \( $p1[0]+$p2[0]+$p4[0]+$p5[0] \). 

$BR
$BR 
$BBOLD (f) $EBOLD Since A occurring precludes B from occurring, and vice versa, the two events are mutually exclusive.

$BR
$BR 

$BBOLD (g) $EBOLD Events are exhaustive when their union is the sample space. Since there is a possibility that the return rate is between 0% and 10%, events
A and B are not exhaustive.
