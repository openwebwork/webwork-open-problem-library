"Do you agree with the following statement? ~~"Checking whether the sum of residuals is zero is sufficient to conclude that a linear regression model is appropriate.~~"",
"No, the sum of residuals will always add to zero. One should also check the residual plot. If there is a pattern in the residual plot, it indicates that a linear regression model is NOT appropriate."
);
$mc->extra(
"Yes, the sum of residuals equating to zero confirms appropriateness of a linear regression model.",
"Yes. In fact, examining only the scatterplot of \(Y\,\) vs. \(X\) is sufficient to conclude that a linear regression model is appropriate.",
"No, the sum of residuals will never add to zero. It is either \(+1\) or \(-1\).",
