BEGIN_TEXT
BlueSky Air has the best on-time arrival rate with 80$PERCENT of
its flights arriving on time. A test is conducted by randomly
selecting 16 BlueSky Air flights and observing whether they arrive on time.

$PAR
What is the probability that 2 flights of BlueSky Air arrive late? 
(Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. 
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).    

$PAR
Probability (as a proportion) \{ ans_rule(6) \}
