BEGIN_PGML
Data were collected from all 10 year olds in a soccer league. Based on this
dataset, a least squares regression model was fitted to predict weight
[`Y`] (in kg) from height [`X`] (in cm). The model fitted was

[```Y = 0.99X - 101.24```]

The interpretation of the *slope* of the regression line would be,
