How does evidence of economic recession influence an individual's
attitudes toward redistribution of wealth? Is it the case that during a
period of economic crisis, attitudes toward redistribution are influenced by
how attractive one is to potential mates? White$BITALIC et al.$EITALIC (2013)
conducted a series of studies to investigate these and related questions. In
their study 2a, subjects were split at random into two groups. One, the
control group, read an article about a person organizing their personal
office space. The other group read an article of the same length about the
economic crisis and how it had affected the life of a man who had
unexpectedly lost his job. Afterwards, participants responded to
questionnaires about their political attitudes, level of attractiveness to
potential mates (via the Landolt Mate-Value Scale), and socioeconomic
status. The study on political attitudes had a particular focus on views
relating to$BITALIC wealth redistribution,$EITALIC and responses were scored on a
scale on which a higher score is consistent with views favoring more
progressive wealth redistribution and social policies. Via the Mate-Value
Scale, responders of each sex could be categorised as of 'low mate-value' 
(so relatively unattractive to potential mates) or 'high mate-value' (relatively
attractive to potential mates). We focus here only on results for men
classified as being of low mate-value.

A test that could reasonably be applied to the data here is the$BITALIC
two-sample t-test.$EITALIC This tests the null hypothesis that the means of two
Normal distributions, \(\mu _{1}\) and \(\mu _{2}\) say, are equal. The test
takes samples of sizes \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\) respectively from the two
distributions, and computes their sample means, \(\bar{x}_{1}\) and \(\bar{x}_{2}\), 
and standard deviations, \(s_{1}\) and \(s_{2}\), say. There are variants
of the test, but often the test statistic is taken as
$BR $BR
$BCENTER
\[
t = \frac{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s_{p}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{p}^{2}}{n_{2}}}}
\]

One-sided seems appropriate for the researchers, as they suggest "We predicted that the economic threat manipulation would
lead low mate-value men to adopt more pro-social orientation...", the view expressed apparently based on previous research.

The test statistic can be calculated with the equations described in the question. First, we calculate the pooled standard deviation,
$BR $BR
\[
\begin{align*}
s_{p}^{2} &= \frac{ \left( n_{1}-1 \right) s_{1}^{2} + \left( n_{2}-1 \right) s_{2}^{2}} {\left( n_{1}-1 \right) + \left( n_{2}-1 \right) } \\
&= \frac{ \left( 11-1 \right) $xsd^{2} + \left( 12-1 \right) $ysd^{2}} {\left( 11-1 \right) + \left( 12-1 \right) }
\end{align*}
\]
$BR $BR

and then the test statistic:

$BR $BR
\[
\begin{align*}
t &= \frac{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s_{p}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{p}^{2}}{n_{2}}}} \\
&= \frac{$xbar-$ybar} {\sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{11} + \frac{s_p^2}{12}}} \\
&= $ans_d_round
\end{align*}
\]
$BR $BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR $BR
The P-value can be found using R's $BBOLD pt $EBOLD function with $(n_1-1) + (n_2-1)$ degrees of freedom (this is degrees of freedom used by the $BBOLD t.test $EBOLD function in R).
$BR $BR

$BBOLD
pt($ans_d_round, df=(11-1 + 12-1))
$EBOLD

$BR $BR
The P-value is approximately $ans_e_round .
