Side-by-side boxplots
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
There is no difference between the distributions of the weights of the frogs in the two lakes.
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD

Two-sided.

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD

The test can be performed in R with the data in vectors $BITALIC x $EITALIC and $BITALIC y $EITALIC (say) as follows:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
wilcoxtest <- wilcox.test(x=x,y=y,alternative='two.sided',mu=0,paired=FALSE,conf.int=FALSE,exact=TRUE)
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
The test statistic is denoted \(W\) in R and is $BITALIC wilcoxtest\{$DOLLAR\}statistic $EITALIC. The P-value is $BITALIC wilcoxtest\{$DOLLAR\}p.value $EITALIC.
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
If $BITALIC wilcoxtest\{$DOLLAR\}p.value $EITALIC < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis at the 5\{$PERCENT\} significance level, otherwise we do not reject the null hypothesis.
