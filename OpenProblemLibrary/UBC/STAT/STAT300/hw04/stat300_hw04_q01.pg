It has been hypothesised that the probability of having an asthma attack on a particular day may vary across the days of the week. Baibergenov \{$BITALIC\}et al.\{$EITALIC\} (2005) report a longitudinal study in which the number of emergency department admissions due to asthma were recorded in Ontario between April 2001 and March 2004. Suppose the data were as in the table below:

Say we input the data into R as follows:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
y <- c($data[1], $data[2], $data[3], $data[4], $data[5], $data[6], $data[7])
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
We total the number of attacks and divide by 7, this being 
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC sum(y)/7 $EITALIC
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The test can be performed in R with the data in vector $BITALIC y $EITALIC as follows:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
chisqtest <- chisq.test(y, p = rep(1/7, 7))
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
Alternatively R Commander can be used. Either way, the test statistic
is 
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC chisqtest\{$DOLLAR\}statistic $EITALIC
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The P-value is $BITALIC chisqtest\{$DOLLAR\}p.value $EITALIC.
