Duncan $BITALIC et al. $EITALIC (2012) report a study which explores the effect on course grade of cell phone use during class. As part of the study, students in five University of Colorado Astronomy classes self-reported their cell phone usage per one hour class. Students were then classified by their cell phone use into four groups: Never, 1-2, 3-4, and >5 times per class. The grades of the students were recorded on a four point scale with an 'A' being 4.0. Suppose the grades from one of the five classes were as tabulated below:

Side-by-side boxplots would be preferable. Note that the graphic in the article is no more illuminating than the figures in the table 1 presented on the same page.

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD

$BR
In the population of students who take an Astronomy class at the University of Colorado, if placed into four groups determined by their cell phone use in class as above, the means of the course grades are equal. Note that although the article talks about the "correlation between cell phone use and course grade", there is no way to estimate such a correlation based on the data collected.

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD

$BR
With the data from the four groups in columns $BITALIC x1, x2, x3, x4 \{$EITALIC\}, we can use the following code in R:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
Grades <- c(x1,x2,x3,x4) $BR
y <- c(rep(1,9), rep(2,18), rep(3,7), rep(4,6)) $BR
CellPhoneUsage <- factor(y) $BR
test <- kruskal.test(Grades ~ CellPhoneUsage)
$EITALIC

$BR
$BR

Alternatively, R Commander can be used. Either way, the test statistic can be obtained with $BITALIC test\{$DOLLAR\}statistic\{$EITALIC\}.

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD

The Chi-squared distribution on three degrees of freedom.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The P-value is $BITALIC test\{$DOLLAR\}p.value\{$EITALIC\}. If $BITALIC test\{$DOLLAR\}p.value\{$EITALIC\} < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis at the 5$PERCENT significance level, otherwise we do not reject the null hypothesis.
