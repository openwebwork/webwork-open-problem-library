Do male and female skiers differ in their tendency to use a ski helmet? Ruzic and Tudor (2011) report a study in which 710 skiers completed a survey about aspects of their skiing habits. Suppose the results from the question on the survey about ski helmet usage were as follows:

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
There is no difference between male and female skiers in the proportions who never, occasionally, and always use a ski helmet.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Begin by inputting the data into R. This can be done as follows:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
xm <- matrix(c($xm[0],$xm[1],$xm[2]))
$BR
xf <- matrix(c($xf[0],$xf[1],$xf[2])) 
$BR
datatable <- as.table(rbind(t(xm), t(xf))) 
$BR
dimnames(datatable) <- list(gender=c("M","F"), helmetuse=c("Never","Occasionally","Always"))
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
Then, with the data in \{$BITALIC\}datatable\{$EITALIC\} we can do the test in R:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
chisq <- chisq.test(datatable, correct=TRUE)
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
Under the null hypothesis of no association between helmet usage and gender, the expected number of men who never wear a helmet can be found using \{$BITALIC\}chisq\{$DOLLAR\}expected[1,1]\{$EITALIC\} in R.
$BR
$BR 
Alternatively, R Commander can be used.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The test statistic can be found in R using \{$BITALIC\}chisq\{$DOLLAR\}statistic\{$EITALIC\} .
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The Chi-squared distribution on two degrees of freedom.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The p-value is \{$BITALIC\}chisq\{$DOLLAR\}p.value\{$EITALIC\}. If \{$BITALIC\}chisq\{$DOLLAR\}p.value\{$EITALIC\} < 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis at the 5$PERCENT significance level, otherwise we do not reject the null hypothesis.
