BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
There are fewer runs than would be expected if the series consisted of independent values.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The correct serial correlation plot is $letter[$inv[$k]]
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Evident from the serial correlation plot, the correlation between consecutive values is about $ans_c.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
Since the P-value is $pval based on the given test statistic, the answer is: $ans_d
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The error term can be ignored for prediction purposes since it has mean zero, so we would predict the next value to be \(0.9\times $cd30=$ans_e\). 
$BR
$BR
This is an example of an "autoregressive" model - note the similarity with linear regression, with \(X\left( t\right)\) in effect regressed against \(X\left( t-1\right)\).
