The Ricci v. DeStefano case in New Haven, CT (129 S. Ct. 2659, Sup. Court, 2009), involved a claim of "reverse" discrimination. Firefighters in the city took examinations to progress through the ranks. One test was for promotion to lieutenant, and at the time the city had eight such positions to fill. The city's charter required the fire department to appoint from the candidates with the best ten scores on the relevant examination. All the top ten scores were from white applicants. The district declined to certify the exam and did not promote any of the candidates, on the grounds that doing so would fail to promote sufficient visible minority candidates to an existing position.

It is of interest to investigate whether there appears to be a difference in the mean scores on the examination for the three identified racial groups: white, black, and Hispanic. Suppose the test score data were as displayed below:

Suppose we perform our pairwise comparisons, to test for a significant difference in the mean scores between each pair of racial groups. If investigating for a significant difference in the mean scores between blacks and whites, what would be the smallest absolute distance between the sample means that would suggest a significant difference? Assume the test is at the 5$PERCENT significance level, and give your answer to 3 decimal places.

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
If group \(i\) contains \(n_i\) observations with mean \(\bar{y}_{i\cdot}\), the estimate of the common variance is the error mean square, MSE,
$BR
$BR
\(
s_p^2 = \frac{\sum^3_{i=1} \sum^{n_i}_{j=1} (y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{i\cdot})^2}{77 - 3} = \frac{\sum^3_{i=1}(n_i-1) s_i^2}{74} = $ans_a
\)
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
We can calculate the error MS for part \(\text{i}\) from the table, where
$BR
$BR
\(
MS_{Error} = \frac{SS_{Error}}{74} = \frac{$SS[1]}{74} =  $ans_b_i
\)
$BR
$BR

The F statistic is just the ratio of the \(MS_{Race}\) and the \(MS_{Error}\), so for part \(\text{ii}\) can be found with
$BR
$BR
\(
F = \frac{MS_{Race}}{MS_{Error}} = \frac{$MS[0]}{$MS[1]} = $ans_b_ii
\)
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The P-value can be found in R using the F statistic calculated in part b using
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
pf($ans_b_ii, 2, 74, lower.tail=FALSE)
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
Since the P-value is $GTLT than 0.05, the correct response is
$BR
$BR
"$ans_c"
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The difference \(\bar{y}_{b\cdot} - \bar{y}_{w\cdot}\) is considered significantly (at the 5$PERCENT level) different from zero if its absolute value is greater than 
$BR
$BR
\(
d_{b,w} = t_{74} \left(1 - \frac{0.05}{6}\right) \sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{19} + \frac{s_p^2}{43}}
\)
$BR
$BR
where \(t_{74} \left(1 - 0.05/6\right)\) is the \(\left(1 - 0.05/6\right)100\) percentile point of the \(t_{74}\) distribution and \(s_p^2\) is the error MS found above. The \(\left(1 - 0.05/6\right)100=99.167$PERCENT\) point of \(t_{74}\) is approximately (via R) 2.4498, and so the minimum difference is approximately
$BR
$BR
\(
2.4498\ s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{19} + \frac{1}{43}} = 0.67486\ s_p = $ans_d
\)
