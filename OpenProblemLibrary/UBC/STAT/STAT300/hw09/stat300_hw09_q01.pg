Do less agreeable Facebook users tend to spend more time on Facebook?
A study (Ivcevic and Ambady, 2013) aimed to investigate various facets
of use of the social networking website Facebook. Previous research
suggested that individuals with poorer face-to-face social skills may
find internet-based social platforms less daunting, so as part of the
study Ivcevic and Ambady investigated whether an individual's volume
of Facebook use was associated with levels of "agreeableness". The
subjects were 99 university students who all had a Facebook page. The
subjects agreed to allowing the content of their Facebook pages to be
downloaded on six separate occasions over a three-week period. As part
of the data gathered on each subject, each of the 99 were individually
rated by a selected friend on an "agreeableness" scale (based on average
ratings on a questionnaire where all responses were on a Likert scale),
with 1 being "low" and 5 "high". We consider here the relationship
between "friend reported" agreeableness and the number of words the
subjects posted on their Facebook pages per day, as measured by an
average word count over a subset of the six days. Suppose the data
were as illustrated below:

If a linear model is fitted to the data above by least squares, the
estimate of the slope parameter is $slope and the estimate of the intercept is $intercept.
The standard error of the estimate of the slope coefficient was
found to be $se_slope. Provide a
95% confidence interval for the underlying slope parameter, giving your bounds to 3 decimal places.

If testing the null hypothesis that the volume of FaceBook activity
(as measured by mean daily word counts on updates) does not
depend linearly on agreeableness, what would be your test statistic
(to 3 decimal places)?

The correlation is approximately -0.3.

We require \(\text{SE}\left(\hat{\beta}_1\right)\), the estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{\beta}_1\), given as $se_slope. The relevant percentile on the t distribution is found from$BITALIC qt(0.975, df=97, lower.tail=TRUE)$EITALIC. 
$BR
$BR
The confidence interval is therefore
$BR
$BR
\(
\hat{\beta}_1 \pm 1.9847 \times \text{SE}\left(\hat{\beta}_1\right) = $slope \pm 1.9847 \times $se_slope
\)

The test statistic is

\(

Based on the past research, it seems plausible here to use a one-sided test. If the test statistic above falls below \(t_{97}(0.05) = -1.661\) the answer is

"Since the observed test statistic falls in the lower 5 percentile of the t distribution with 97 degrees of freedom, we can reject the null hypothesis that the volume of FaceBook activity does not depend linearly on agreeableness."

Otherwise, far less likely, the response is
