O.L. Davies (1960, pp. 258-267) describes an experiment exploring the effect of certain factors on the percentage yield of a nitration process, the product of which forms the basis of various medicinal products. The three factors investigated were as follows, each with two levels as described below.

$BR
$BR

The time of addition of nitric acid: 2 hours or 7 hours. $BR
The time of stirring: either 1/2 hour or 4 hours. $BR
Heel: either present or absent.

$BR
$BR

Heel is a slang term for residual product left in the container from the previous batch. It may not always be possible to completely remove this residue, which could possibly impact the yield in the succeeding batch.

$BR
$BR
Suppose the data were as displayed below:

BEGIN_SOLUTION

We must first set up the data in R. We show one way to do this:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
yield <- c(@yield[0], @yield[1], @yield[2], @yield[3], @yield[4], @yield[5], @yield[6], @yield[7]) $BR
A <- as.factor(c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)) # This is 'Time of addition of nitric acid' $BR
B <- as.factor(c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1)) # This is 'Time of stirring' $BR
C <- as.factor(c(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1)) # This is 'Heel'
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
The ANOVA table can be created as follows
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
model1 <- aov(yield ~A+B+C) $BR
summary1 <- anova(model1)
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
From the above object, the relevant statistics can be extracted as follows:
$BR
$BR
$BITALIC
summary1\{$DOLLAR\}F[1] $BR
summary1\{$DOLLAR\}Pr[1]
$EITALIC
$BR
$BR
The above give the required F statistic and P-value respectively.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR
The correct interaction plot is created via $BITALIC interaction.plot(A, B, yield) $EITALIC $BR
This is plot $letter[$inv[$k]] as given.

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

The main effect for the time of addition of nitric acid is as follows:

$BR
$BR
\(
\frac{(@yield[1] + @yield[3] + @yield[5] + @yield[7]) - (@yield[0] + @yield[2] + @yield[4] + @yield[6]) } {4} = $ans_b
\)
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

The F statistic is $BITALIC summary1\{$DOLLAR\}F[1] $EITALIC.

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

The P-value is $BITALIC summary1\{$DOLLAR\}Pr[1] $EITALIC.

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

If $BITALIC summary1\{$DOLLAR\}Pr[1] $EITALIC < 0.05 we consider the time of addition of nitric acid to be significant, and so on...
