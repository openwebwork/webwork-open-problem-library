# The question text
$qu_text = "
How much does novelty influence the choice of vacation destination? Petrick (2002) reports results of a survey in which 448 golf vacationers completed a postal survey after their stay at a golf resort. The questionnaire included thirteen items on aspects of 'novelty' regarding golf vacations: four assessing 'thrill', and three each on 'change from routine', 'boredom alleviation', and 'surprise'. Each item required a response on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where a higher number indicated a greater novelty value. Certain research hypotheses related to how factors of novelty would be predicted by four explanatory variables: the number of golf rounds played per year \(\left( X_{1}\right)\), the lifetime total number of
golf vacations taken \(\left( X_{2}\right)\), the number of years playing golf \(\left( X_{3}\right)\), and the mean golf score \(\left( X_{4}\right)\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

For vacationers with a common number of rounds per year, a common number of lifetime golf vacations, and of the same golf ability, the average total 'change from routine' score increases by \(\beta _{3}\) units for every one year increase in the number of years playing golf.

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

Assuming the t distribution is used with 443 degrees of freedom, the standardized statistic can be found via
$BR
$BR
t <- qt(P, df=443)
$BR
$BR
The estimate of the standard deviation of the estimate is $beta3/t. If the standard Normal is used in place of the t distribution there is no material difference in the inference.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

There is evidence to reject the hypothesis that total 'change from routine' score does not depend linearly on the number of years playing golf in favour of the alternative that there is a linear dependence with a negative coefficient. 
$BR
$BR
Petrick (pp.394-395) concludes '...those who have played golf for more years are less apt to seek change from their normal routine ... in their golf vacations.', but this is problematic, not least since the survey item responses may have no predictive power for vacation choice.

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

The P-value is found via the \(F_{4,443}\) distribution; in R via 
$BR
$BR

pf(F, 4, 443, lower.tail = FALSE).

$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

The percentage of variation in the 'surprise' item totals that is accounted for by the four explanatory variables \(X_{1},\dots ,X_{4}\) is $Rsq100.
