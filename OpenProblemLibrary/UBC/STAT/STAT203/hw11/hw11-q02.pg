BlueSky Air claims that at least 80$PERCENT of its flights arrive on time. A random sample of 
160 BlueSky Air flights revealed that 115 arrive on time. Do the data provide sufficient 
evidence to $BBOLD contradict $EBOLD the claim by BlueSky Air (i.e., you would like to see whether
the percentage of the airline's flight is below what the airline claims)?
