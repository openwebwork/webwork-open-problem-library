BEGIN_PGML

An online used car company sells pre-owned cars. For 30 randomly
selected transactions, the mean price is [$mean] dollars.

a) Assuming the population standard deviation for transaction
prices is [$stdev] dollars, obtain a 99% confidence interval for
the mean price of all transactions. Please carry at least three
decimal places in intermediate steps. Give your final answer to
the nearest two decimal places.

    Confidence interval: [__]{$conf_int} [@ helpLink('interval') @]*

b) Which of the following is a correct interpretation for your answer
    in part (a)? Select ALL the correct answers, there may be more than one.

    [__]{$checks}
