An online used car company sells second-hand cars. For 30 randomly selected transactions, the mean price is $mean dollars.

$PAR
$BBOLD Part a)$EBOLD 
Assuming a population standard deviation transaction prices of $stdev dollars, obtain a 99$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean price of all transactions. Please carry at least three decimal places in intermediate steps. Give your final answer to the nearest two decimal places. $BR$BR

Confidence interval: (\{ans_rule(10)\},\{ans_rule(10)\}). $BR
