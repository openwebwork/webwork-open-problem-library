BEGIN_PGML
Which of the following selected variables, associated with clinical trials of a
drug, are quantitative variables? *CHECK ALL THAT APPLY*

[_]{$checks}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Quantative variables are numeric.  Note that Age is categorized into decades, so no longer quantitative and the dosage is categorized into a number (probably for coding), so also not quantitative. 

The solution to this is [$checks].
