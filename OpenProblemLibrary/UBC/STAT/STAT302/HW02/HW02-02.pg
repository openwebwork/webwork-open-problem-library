A soccer team plays in a division with $t teams in total. Each team plays every other team twice, home and away, during the season. The result of each game is recorded as the name of the teams, and a home win, an away win, or a draw.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD

$BR

We begin by counting the number of games a particular team will play. Each team plays all the other $tM1 teams twice, so there are \( 2 \times $tM1 = $TtM1 \) games for each team. There are three possible results for each fixture, so the total number of possible results for a given team is given by \(3^{$TtM1} \approx $ansA\).

$BR $BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD

$BR

Now consider the entire league. We begin by counting the number of games that are played. Since there are $t teams, we have \($t \times $tM1 = $t_t_tm1\) games that will be played throughout the league. Each of these games have 3 possible states (Home win, Away win, Draw), and so the total number of outcomes in the sample space is \(3^{$t_t_tm1}\). Taking the natural logarithm of this quantity yields \(\text{log}(3^{$t_t_tm1}) \approx $ansB\).
