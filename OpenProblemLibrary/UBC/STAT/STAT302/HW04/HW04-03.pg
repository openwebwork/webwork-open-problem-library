BEGIN_TEXT

A breathalyser test is used by police in an area to determine whether a driver has an excess of alcohol in their blood. The device is not totally reliable: $pper $PERCENT of drivers who have not consumed an excess of alcohol give a reading from the breathalyser as being above the legal limit, while 10 $PERCENT of drivers who are above the legal limit will give a reading below that level. Suppose that in fact $qper $PERCENT of drivers are above the legal alcohol limit, and the police stop a driver at random. Give answers to the following to four decimal places.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR

Part a) $BR $BR

\( P(\text{positive test and driver below limit}) = P(\text{positive test} | \text{driver below limit}) P(\text{driver below}) \)

\( = $p \times (1 - $q) \)

\( = $ans_a. \)

$BR $BR

Part b) $BR $BR

Since $BR

\( P(\text{positive test and driver above limit}) = P(\text{positive test} | \text{driver above limit}) P(\text{driver above}) \)

\( = 0.9 \times $q \)

\( = $ans_b . \) $BR

$BR $BR

Part c) 

$BR $BR

Events (a) and (b) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for a driver testing positive so $BR $BR

\( P(\text{positive test}) = $p \times (1-$q) + 0.9 \times $q \)

\( = $ans_c . \)

$BR $BR

Part d) $BR $BR

Using Bayes' Theorem, $BR $BR

\( P(\text{driver below} | \text{reading below}) = \frac{P(\text{driver below}) P(\text{reading below} | \text{driver below}) } { P(\text{driver below}) P(\text{reading below} | \text{driver below}) + P(\text{driver above}) P(\text{reading below} | \text{driver above}) } \)

$BR $BR

\( = \frac{(1-$q) (1-$p)}{(1-$q)(1-$p) + 0.1 \times $q} \)

\( = $ans_d. \)
