@question = ("You have a penny, a nickel, a dime, a toonie, and a loonie. How many different (non-zero) sums of money can you produce?", "A test contains eight true/false questions. Assuming you attempt each question, in how many different ways could you answer the test?");

@ans = ("31", "256");

@sol = ("There are two possibilities for each of the five coins: being included or not. For each possibility for a single coin, there are two possibilities for each of the other four. Multiplying, the total number of possibilities is therefore \( 2^5 = 32 \). However, this contains the case when no coin is included, so excluding this possibility leaves \( 31 \) different sums of money. $BR Alternatively, note that we can choose five, four, three, two, or one coin(s), and the number of combinations in each case can be added together to give $BR \( 1 + {5 \choose 4} + {5 \choose 3} + {5 \choose 2} + 5 = 31. \)", "There are two possibilities for each of the eight questions: true or false. For each possibility for a single question, there are two possibilities for each of the other seven. Multiplying, the total number of possibilities is therefore \( 2^8 = 256. \) ");
