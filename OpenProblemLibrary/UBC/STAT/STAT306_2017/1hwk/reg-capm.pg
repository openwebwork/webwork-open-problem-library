# Main Text
BEGIN_TEXT
The variables are x=SP500 market monthly log return and 
y = monthly return of $stklab for 48 months beginning in January
$actyr. 
$BR
For input into R, the 
data vectors for monthly market return and monthly stock return
are 
$BR
$xstr 
$BR
and
$BR
$ystr
$BR

$BR

For the questions below, use 3 decimal places.

$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
$BR
The coefficients of the least square regression line are
$BR
\({\hat \beta}_0\)= \{ ans_rule(8) \}
$BR
\({\hat \beta}_1\)= \{ ans_rule(8) \}
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
$BR
Next, the least squares equation in (a) is used for out-of-sample
assessment.
Suppose we want to get a prediction interval for each of the next 10 months
(beginning January $actyr4)
when the SP500 returns are values in the following R vector.
$BR
$xnextstr 
$BR

<BR>
The t critical value for the 95% prediction interval is \{ ans_rule(8) \}.
$BR
Using the fitted regression equation for January $actyr to December
$actyr3,
the lower endpoint of the 95% prediction interval for January
$actyr4 (SP500 return $xnext[0]) is
\{ ans_rule(8) \}.
$BR
The upper endpoint of this 95% prediction interval 
is \{ ans_rule(8) \}.
$BR
The lower endpoint of the 95% prediction interval for October
$actyr4 (SP500 return $xnext[9]) 
is \{ ans_rule(8) \}.
$BR
The upper endpoint of this 95% prediction interval 
is \{ ans_rule(8) \}.
$BR

$BR
$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
$BR
Get the 10 out-of-sample prediction intervals for January to October $actyr4 from
part (b) of which you were asked to enter two intervals.
The actual values of the monthly stock returns for $stklab are
in the following vector
$BR
$ynextstr 
$BR
How many of these observed values (not used in the fitted regression equation)
are contained in the corresponding prediction intervals.
(The response here is an integer between 0 and 10; theoretically
it is close to 9.)
$BR
\{ ans_rule(8) \}
