Leg ulcers are a common and complex health problem, particularly among
the elderly, and can be costly and time-consuming to treat. Harrison 
$BITALIC et al. $EITALIC (2005) report a Canadian initiative to implement a new care model
for patients with leg ulcers. The new model incorporated specially trained
staff, detailed initial assessments, and evidence-based treatments. Data
were collected for one year before the implementation of the new model and
one year afterwards within a particular home-care authority covering a
population of about one million. One outcome of interest was the frequency
of visits required for patients under the two models. Suppose the table
below gives the observed counts:
$BR
$BR
\[
\begin{array}{cr}
& \mbox{Model  } \\
\mbox{Visit frequency} & 
\begin{array}{r|rr}
& \mbox{Old} & \mbox{New} \\ \hline
<2 \mbox{ per week} & $xold[0] & $xnew[0] \\ 
2 \mbox{ per week} & $xold[1] & $xnew[1]  \\ 
3 \mbox{ per week} & $xold[2] & $xnew[2]  \\ 
\mbox{At least daily} & $xold[3] & $xnew[3] 
\end{array}
\end{array}

$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
The null hypothesis here is that the distributions of frequencies of
visits to leg ulcer patients are the same under both the old and the new
care models. Under this hypothesis, compute the maximum likelihood estimate
of the probability that a patient requires less than two visits per week
under the old model, giving your answer to two decimal places.

Assuming the null hypothesis, find the expected number of patients in
the sample requiring at least daily visits under the new care model, giving
your answer to two decimal places.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
Let \(\pi _{11}\), \(\pi _{21}\), \(\pi _{31}\), and \(\pi _{41}\)
respectively denote the probabilities of
falling in each of the four visit frequency categories for a patient
under the old model. These four parameters are the probabilities for a
Multinomial distribution across the four categories for patients under the
old model.  Similarly, let \(\pi _{12}\), \(\pi _{22}\), \(\pi_{32}\), and 
\(\pi _{42}\) respectively denote the category
probabilities for a second Multinomial distribution, this for the
categories of visit frequencies of patients under the new care model. The
null hypothesis states that these two Multinomial distributions have the
same probabilities:
\[
H_{0}:\pi _{i1}=\pi _{i2},\text{for  } i=1,...,4.
\]
Under the null hypotheses we have \(\pi _{11}=\pi _{12}\), which
we can denote \(\pi _{1\cdot }\). The MLE for this parameter is \(($xold[0]+$xnew[0])/238=$ans_a\). 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
In the fourth row of the table, the common estimated probability
for the category is \(($xold[3]+$xnew[3])/238\). Therefore, we
would expect a frequency of
\[
\frac{$xold[3]+$xnew[3]}{238}\times 167=$ans_b
\]
in the sample from the new model.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
The test can be performed in R via
$BR
$BITALIC
x1 <- c($xold[0], $xold[1], $xold[2], $xold[3])$BR
x2 <- c($xnew[0], $xnew[1], $xnew[2], $xnew[3])$BR
tab <- as.table(rbind(t(x1), t(x2)))$BR
chisqulcer <- chisq.test(tab)$BR
$EITALIC
The test statistic is $BITALIC chisqulcer$stat = $ans_c$EITALIC.
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
There are two Multinomial distributions, each across four possible
values, though the null hypothesis asserts that the parameters for each
distribution are equal. Hence there are \(4-1=3\) free parameters. 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
The response depends on the P-value of the above test,
which is $BITALIC chisqulcer$pval $EITALIC. Only responses (i), (ii),
(iii), and (vii) as listed are possible.
