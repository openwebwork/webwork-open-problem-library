Certain chemicals present in personal care products have been shown to
be harmful to animals in lab experiments. These chemicals may be harmful to
humans, and can be absorbed via cosmetic lotions and creams. Janjua $BITALIC et
al. $EITALIC (2008) report a study involving 26 Caucasian male volunteers. After a
pre-cleansing stage, each subject applied a topical cream over their entire
body for five consecutive days, this being a control treatment that did not
contain the three chemicals of interest. In the second week of the study,
the subjects daily applied a lotion that contained three chemicals of
interest: diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and butyl
paraben (BP). Subjects were not told which lotion was the control. Once
taken into the body, DEP and DBP metabolise into monethyl phthalate (MEP)
and monobutyl phthalate (MBP) respectively. Levels of MEP, MBP, and BP were
measured in urine samples daily on each subject. We focus on levels of MBP
after one day of application of each of the control and treatment lotions.
Suppose the observed levels of MBP (in \(\mu\)g per day) were as follows:

Suppose the differences between the MBP levels in the treatment condition
and the control lotion are assumed to be Normally distributed with some mean 
\(\delta\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). Interest resides in the mean
increase in MBP level \(\delta\) due to one application of the treatment
lotion. $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
The mean of the sample differences is the MLE of 
\(\delta\), which in this case is \(\hat{\delta}=$ans_a\)  \(\mu g\).
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD
We are assuming that the differences are from the \(N\left(\delta,\sigma ^{2}\right)\)
distribution, for some \(\sigma\). This suggests the sample mean of 26 observations from 
this distribution would have standard deviation \(\sigma/\sqrt{26}\). In the case \(\sigma=$sigma\),
this is \($sigma/\sqrt{26} = $ans_b\)  \(\mu g\).
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD
In the case that \(\sigma^{2}\) is unknown, we would estimate it
by the sample variance of the differences. In this case, our estimate of the
standard deviation of the MLE of \(\delta\) is \($sd/\sqrt{26} = $ans_c\)  \(\mu g\). 
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
An approximate 95% confidence interval for \(\delta\) is 
\[
\hat{\delta}\pm t_{25}\left( 0.975\right) SE\left( \hat{\delta}\right) =
\hat{\delta}\pm 2.0555 \times \frac{$sd}{\sqrt{26}}.
\]
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
The test statistic can be taken as the standardised difference 
\(\hat{\delta}/SE\left( \hat{\delta}\right)\), which under the null
hypothesis \(H_{0}:\delta =0\) approximately satisfies
\[
\frac{\hat{\delta}}{SE\left( \hat{\delta}\right) }\sim t_{25}.
\]
The test can be performed in R via 
$BR
$BITALIC
x1 <- c($xdisp1) $BR
x2 <- c($xdisp2) $BR
difftest <- t.test(x2,x1,alternative=c("greater"),paired=TRUE) $BR
difftest$pval $BR
$EITALIC
The answer is one of (a)-(d), depending on the value of P.
