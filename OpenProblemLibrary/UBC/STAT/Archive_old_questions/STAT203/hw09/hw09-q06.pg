BEGIN_TEXT
BlueSky Air has the best on-time arrival rate with $prob$PERCENT of
its flights arriving $BITALIC on time $EITALIC. A test is conducted by randomly
selecting 16 BlueSky Air flights and observing whether they arrive on time.

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part a $EBOLD
$BR
What is the $BBOLD exact $EBOLD probability that 2 flights of BlueSky Air arrive $BITALIC late $EITALIC? 
(Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. 
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).    
$BR
Probability (as a proportion) \{ ans_rule(6) \}

$BR
$BBOLD Part b $EBOLD
$BR
Finding the $BBOLD exact $EBOLD probability that at least 8 flights of BlueSky Air arrive $BITALIC late $EITALIC
can be very tedious. As such we make use of Normal approximation model. What is the $BBOLD approximated $EBOLD
probability?
(Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. 
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).  
$BR
Probability (as a proportion) \{ ans_rule(6) \}
