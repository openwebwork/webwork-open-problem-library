BEGIN_TEXT
The number of major faults on a randomly chosen 1 km stretch of highway has a Poisson distribution with mean $k. The random variable \(X\) is the distance (in km) between two successive major faults on the highway. 

$PAR
$BBOLD Part a) $EBOLD
What is the probability of having at least one major fault in the next 2 km stretch on the highway? Give your answer to 3 decimal places.  \{ ans_rule(6) \}


$PAR
$BBOLD Part b) $EBOLD

\{ $mc2->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc2->print_a() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD Part c) $EBOLD

\{ $mc3->print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc3->print_a() \}

$PAR
$BBOLD Part d) $EBOLD
What is the median distance (in km) between successive major faults? Give your answer to 2 decimal places.  \{ ans_rule(6) \}

$PAR
$BBOLD Part e) $EBOLD
What is the probability you must travel more than 3 km before
encountering the next four major faults? Give your answer to 3 decimal places. \{ ans_rule(6) \}

$PAR
$BBOLD Part f) $EBOLD
By expressing the problem as a sum of independent Exponential random variables and applying the Central Limit Theorem, find the approximate probability that you must travel more than 25 km before encountering the next 33 major faults? Give your answer to 3 decimal places. Please use R to obtain probabilities and keep at least 6 decimal places in intermediate steps. \{ ans_rule(6) \}
