BEGIN_TEXT
Items in your inventory are produced at three different plants: 
50$PERCENT from plant A1, 
30$PERCENT from plant A2 and 
20$PERCENT from plant A3. 
You are aware that your plants produce at different levels of quality: 
A1 produces 5 percent defectives, 
A2 produces 7 percent defectives and 
A3 yields 8 percent defectives. 
You randomly select an item from your inventory and it turns out to be 
defective. Which plant is the item most likely to have come from?

The correct answer is \{ $radio->correct_ans() \}
$PAR

Draw a decision tree. If a sample is chosen at random, it could 
have come from A1 (probability 50$PERCENT), A2 (30$PERCENT), or A3 (20$PERCENT).
Now consider if the sample is defective. If it came from A1, the probability that 
it is defective is 5$PERCENT. So the probability that the sample came from A1
AND is defective is 50$PERCENT times 5$PERCENT, or 2.5$PERCENT. If you calculate
the probability for the sample being defective in the other two cases, you will 
see that the first case has the highest probability.
