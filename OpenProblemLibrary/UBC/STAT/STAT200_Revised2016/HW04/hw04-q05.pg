A study investigated the effect of the length and the repetition of TV advertisements on students' desire to eat at a Sub-U-Like sandwich franchise. Sixty students watched a 50-minute television program that showed at least one commercial for Sub-U-Like during advertisement breaks. Some students saw a 30-second commerical, others a 90-second commerical. The same commerical was shown one, three, or five times during the program. After the viewing, each student was asked to rate their craving for a Sub-U-Like sandwich on a scale of 0 to 10.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The study is an experiment, as the subjects are
exposed (at random) to different conditions and their responses measured. In
this case the response variable is a measure of the craving for a Sub-U-Like
sub. There are two factors in the study: the length of the commercial and
the number of times it was shown. One factor has three levels and the other
two, so there are six treatments in total.
