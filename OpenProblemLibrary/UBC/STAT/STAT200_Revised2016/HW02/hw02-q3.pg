BEGIN_TEXT

The shelf life of a battery produced by one major company is known 
to be Normally distributed, with a mean life of @mu[0] years and a standard deviation of @sd[0] years.

$PAR

What value of shelf life do 16${PERCENT} of the battery shelf lives fall above? Round your answer to one decimal place.
$BR $BR

Answer: \{ ans_rule( 15 ) \} years.

END_TEXT

ANS( 
    num_cmp( @upper[0], tol => 0.05, tolType => "absolute")
);

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
As 68% of the Normal distribution falls within one standard
deviation of the mean, we know that 68% of the batteries have shelf lives
between @lower[0] and  @upper[0] years. Now 32% fall
outside that range, 16% either side. Hence 16% of shelf lives are above @upper[0].
