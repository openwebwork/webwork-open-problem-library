BEGIN_TEXT
The director of an alumni association for a university wants to look at 
the relationship between the number of years since graduation and the amount of monetary contribution an alumnus makes to the university. He collects data on 50 alumni who have made contributions this year. The number of years since graduation has a mean of $meanGrad, and the amount of contribution has a mean of $meanDonate dollars. Based on the least squares regression line fitted to the data, it is found that for every year increase since graduation, the contribution is expected to drop by $slope dollars.

$PAR
Predict the amount of contribution made by an alumnus who graduated $predictTime years ago. Do not round in intermediate steps.
$PAR

The predicted contribution of an alumnus who graduated $predictTime years ago is: \{ ans_rule(10)\} (in dollars, rounded to one decimal place.)

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
We are told that the slope of the regression line
predicting amount donated  \( \left( Y\right) \) by years since
graduation \( \left( X \right) \) has slope \( \hat{\beta}=
$slope \).  Hence the intercept of the line must be
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
\hat{\alpha}= $meanDonate - ( $slope \times $meanGrad)= $a.  
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
The regression line is therefore  \( Y=\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X. \)

When \( X= $predictTime \) years, we predict a
donation of  \( \hat{\alpha}+\left( \hat{\beta}\times $predictTime\right) = $ans  \) dollars.
