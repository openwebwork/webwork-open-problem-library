BEGIN_TEXT
A Statistics professor assigned 10 quizzes over the course of the semester. He wanted to see if there was a relationship between the total mark of all 10 quizzes and the final exam mark. There were @numStudents[0] students who completed all the quizzes and wrote the final exam. The standard deviation of the total quiz marks was @sdQuiz[0], and that of the final exam was @sdFinal[0]. The correlation between the total quiz mark and the final exam was @corr[0].

$PAR
Based on the least squares regression line fitted to the data of the @numStudents[0] students, if a student scored @pointsAbove[0] points above the mean of total quiz marks, then how many points above the mean on the final would you predict her final exam grade to be?

$PAR
The predicted final exam grade is \{ ans_rule(10)\} above the mean on the final. Round your answer to one decimal place, but do not round in intermediate steps.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The slope of the regression line predicting final exam
score  \( \left( Y\right) \) based on quiz score \( \left( X\right) \) has slope
$BR
$BAR
$BCENTER
\(
\hat{\beta}=\mathtt{@corr[0] \times @sdFinal[0] / @sdQuiz[0] = @slope[0].}
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
For each unit change in \(X\) the model predicts a change of \(
\hat{\beta} \) in \(Y\) and the line passes through the point \(
\left( \bar{x},\bar{y}\right)\). Hence if a student scores 
@pointsAbove[0] above the mean quiz score, the model predicts she will score  \(\hat{
\beta}\times \mathtt{@pointsAbove[0]=@ans[0]} \) above the mean in the final
exam.
