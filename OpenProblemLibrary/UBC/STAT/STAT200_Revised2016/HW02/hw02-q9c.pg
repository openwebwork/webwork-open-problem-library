BEGIN_TEXT
An analyst working for a telecommunications company has been asked to gauge the stress on its cellular networks due to the increasing use of smartphones. She decides to first look at the relationship between the number of minutes customers spent talking on their phones and the amount of cellular data they use. She collects data on 300 customers who have smartphones with data plans and fits a least squares regression line to the data, with the data usage as the response variable.

$BR

Jamie, one of the 300 customers, has used an amount of data which gives a negative residual. Which of the following statements must be true about Jamie's actual data usage? 

$BR
$BR

\{ $radio->buttons() \}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
A data point on the scatter plot will have a negative
residual if, when fitting a regression line to the data, the point falls
below the fitted line.
