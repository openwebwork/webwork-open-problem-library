BEGIN_TEXT
An analyst working for a telecommunications company has been asked to gauge the stress on its cellular networks due to the increasing use of smartphones. She decides to first look at the relationship between the number of minutes customers spent talking on their phones and the amount of cellular data they use. She collects a monthâ€™s worth of data on 300 customers who have smartphones with data plans. The mean monthly call time was found to be $meanCallTime minutes, and the mean amount of data consumed was found to be $meanDataUse megabytes. Based on the least squares regression line fitted to the data, it is found that for every minute increase in calling time, the data usage is expected to increase by $slope megabytes.

$PAR
Predict the amount of data used by a customer who spends $predictTime minutes on the phone. Do not round in intermediate steps.
$PAR

The predicted the amount of data used by a customer who spends $predictTime minutes on the phone is: \{ ans_rule(10)\} (in megabytes, rounded to one decimal place).

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
We are told that the slope of the regression line
predicting amount of data used per month  \( \left( Y , in~ Gb \right) \) by call time per month \( \left( X, in~ mins \right) \) has slope \( \hat{\beta}=
$slope \).  Hence the intercept of the line must be
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
\hat{\alpha}= $meanDataUse - ( $slope \times $meanCallTime)= $a.  
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
The regression line is therefore  \( Y=\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X. \)

When \( X= $predictTime \) mins, we predict monthly data use of
 \( \hat{\alpha}+\left( \hat{\beta}\times $predictTime\right) = $ans  \) Gb.
