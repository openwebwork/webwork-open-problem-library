BEGIN_TEXT
In a large class, there were @numStudents[0] students who wrote both the midterm and the final exam. The standard deviation of the midterm grades was @sdMidterm[0], and that of the final exam was @sdFinal[0]. The correlation between the grades on the midterm and the final was @corr[0]. 

$PAR
Based on the least squares regression line fitted to the data of the @numStudents[0] students, if a student scored @pointsBelow[0] points below the mean on the midterm, then how many points below the mean on the final would you predict her final exam grade to be? 

$PAR
The predicted final exam grade is \{ ans_rule(10)\} below the mean on the final. Round your answer to one decimal place, but do not round in intermediate steps.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The slope of the regression line predicting final exam
score  \( \left( Y\right) \) based on midterm test score \( \left(
X\right) \) has slope
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
\hat{\beta}=\mathtt{ @corr[0] \times @sdFinal[0] / @sdMidterm[0] = @slope[0].}
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
For each unit change in \(X\) the model predicts a change of \(
\hat{\beta} \) in \( Y \), and the line passes through the point \(
\left( \bar{x},\bar{y}\right). \)

Hence if a student scores 
@pointsBelow[0] below the mean midterm score, the model predicts she will score \(
\hat{\beta} \times  @pointsBelow[0]= @ans[0] \) below the mean in the final
exam.
