BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose it is believed that the probability a patient will 
recover from a disease following medication is $prob. In a group 
of $numberText[$i] such patients, the number who recover would have 
mean and variance respectively given by  (to one decimal place):
$BR
$BR

Mean: \{ ans_rule(6) \} $BR
Variance: \{ ans_rule(6) \} $BR

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
If \(X\) is Binomially distributed with n trials and the probability of success at each trial being p, then the expectation of X is \(E (X) =np\), and the variance is \(Var(X)=np (1 - p). \) In this case 
\(
E (X) = $number[$i] \times $prob = $ans1  
\)
and 
\(
Var(X) = $number[$i] \times $prob (1 - $prob) =  $ans2.  
\)
