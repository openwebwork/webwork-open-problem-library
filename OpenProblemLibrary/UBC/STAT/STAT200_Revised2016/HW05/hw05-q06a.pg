## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The number of females selected is not a Binomial variable,
as the selection probabilities cannot be the same for each of the two
choices. In fact the number of females selected will follow a so-called
Hypergeometric distribution.
