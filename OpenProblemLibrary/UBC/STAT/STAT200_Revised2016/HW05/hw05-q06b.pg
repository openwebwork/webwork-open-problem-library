## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The number of domestic projects selected is not a Binomial
variable, as the selection probabilities cannot be the same for each of
the two project choices. In fact the number of domestic projects selected
will follow a so-called Hypergeometric distribution.
