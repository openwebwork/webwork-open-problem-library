An epidemiologist is worried about the prevalence of the flu in East Vancouver and the potential shortage of vaccines for the area. She will need to provide a recommendation for how to allocate the vaccines appropriately across the city. She takes a simple random sample of $n people living in East Vancouver and finds that $num have recently had the flu.
$PAR
The epidemiologist will recommend East Vancouver as a location for one of the vaccination programs if her sample data provide sufficient evidence to support that the true proportion of people who have recently had the flu is greater than $pnull.  A test of hypothesis is conducted.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
(i) The inference here is about the population proportion, 
\(p\) say, that recently had the flu. A null hypothesis will
assert a single value to a parameter, and so in this case the null
hypothesis is \( H_{0}:p= $pnull. \)
$BR
$BR
(ii) In the alternative, we are interested in the case where \(p>$pnull.\) Hence this set of values defines the alternative hypothesis. 
$BR
$BR
(iii) Let \(\hat{p}\) denote the sample proportion that recently had the flu. Then if \(p=$pnull,\) we have that
approximately 
\[
\hat{p}\sim N\left( $pnull, \sqrt{\frac{$pnull \left( 
1-$pnull\right) }{$n}}\right) = $mc3_answer. 
\]
$BR
$BR
(iv) The sample proportion observed is \( \hat{p}= $num/ $n.\) 
This value, if consistent with the distribution in (iii), when
standardised gives a z score of 
\[
\frac{$num/$n-$pnull}{\sqrt{\frac{$pnull\left(1-$pnull\right)}{$n}}}= $tem.
\]
Comparing the above figure with the standard Normal distribution, we
know that 95% of the distribution lies in the interval \(\left(
-1.96,1.96\right).\) We can define unusually large or small values as
being outside that range.
