## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
If the sample proportion is denoted \(\hat{p},\) then
an approximate 95% confidence interval based on a sample of size n
has width
\[
2\times 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\left( 1-\hat{p}\right) }{n}}. 
\]
If the sample size is quadrupled to \(4n,\) the width of the
confidence interval will decrease by a factor of 2. If on the other hand we
change to a 68% confidence interval, the width is now approximately
\[
2\times 0.98\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\left( 1-\hat{p}\right) }{n}}, 
\]
half the original.
