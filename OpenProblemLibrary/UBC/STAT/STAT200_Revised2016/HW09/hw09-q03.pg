## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
Two of the options do not relate to comparing
proportions, so are not appropriate. Of the other three, two relate to
proportions that are mutually dependent. For instance, the proportion of
high-income families in BC is dependent on the proportion of low-income
families.
