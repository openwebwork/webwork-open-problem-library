Prospective drivers who enrol in Smart Driver Driving School have always been taught by a conventional teaching method.  The driving school has many branches across provinces. Last year, among all students that took driving lessons from the school in a certain province, 80$PERCENT passed the provincial road test. This year, the teaching committee came up with a new teaching method. The committee randomly assigned half of its 2400 students enrolled this year to receive the conventional teaching method and the remaining half to receive the new teaching method. In a random sample of 100 students who received the conventional teaching method, @mR[0] passed the road test.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameter is the population proportion of drivers
who would pass under the conventional teaching method. The null hypothesis
is that this is unchanged from the past value of 0.80. Note that here, the
population is taken to be the 2400 learner drivers enrolled at the driving
school in the year. 
$BR
$BR
(b) It is stated that it is of interest whether the pass
rate has decreased under the conventional method. 
$BR
$BR
(c) Under the null hypothesis, the population proportion p is
0.8, and the sample proportion will be approximately Normal with mean 0.8
and standard deviation
\[
\sqrt{p\left( 1-p\right) /100}=\sqrt{0.8\times 0.2/100}.
\]
$BR
$BR
(d) This is a one-sided test, with alternative hypothesis that
p<0.8. Hence low values of the sample proportion lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis, and the P-value is found by finding the
probability to the left of @phatR[0] via the model in (c). By
software or tables, this is @pV[0]. 
$BR
$BR
(e) There is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that the proportion
passing under the conventional method has changed from the previous year.
