From previous studies, it has been generally believed that Northern
Hemisphere icebergs have a mean depth of 270 meters. An environmentalist has suggested that global
warming has caused icebergs to have greater depth. A team of
scientists visiting the Northern Hemisphere observed a random sample
of 41 icebergs. The depth of the base of the iceberg below the surface
was carefully measured for each. The sample mean and standard
deviation were calculated to be @xbarR[0] meters and @sdR[0] meters respectively.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameters of concern relate to a population of
interest, not to the data collected.
$BR
$BR

(b) The null hypothesis asserts a default value on a parameter of
interest, the default value in this case of the mean depth of icebergs in
the northern hemisphere is the previously suggested value of 270 m.
$BR
$BR

(c) It is proposed that the mean depth of the population of icebergs
may have increased over time, suggesting a one-sided, right-tailed
alternative. That is, we test \( H_{0}:\mu =270\) against \(H_{A}:\mu
>270,\) where \(\mu \) is the mean depth of northern hemisphere
icebergs.
$BR
$BR

(d) A t-test is appropriate, so the test statistic is
\[
\frac{\bar{x}-\mu }{s/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{@xbarR[0]-270}{@sdR[0]\sqrt{41
}}= @tstatR[0].
\]
$BR
$BR

(e) A t distribution is appropriate since the population standard
deviation is unknown.
$BR
$BR

(f) We compare the test statistic @tstatR[0] with the t
distribution on 40 degrees of freedom. As the test is one-sided and
right-tailed, the probability to the right of @tstatR[0] gives
the P-value, this being @pvalR[0] (from tables or software).
$BR
$BR

(g) As the P-value is less than a significance level of either 0.05 or
0.1, we would reject the null hypothesis at those two significance levels. 
$BR
$BR

(h) The relatively low P-value tells us that if indeed the mean depth
of northern hemisphere icebergs is 270 m, the sample of icebergs must have
been on average appreciably deeper than 270 m. If we reject the null
hypothesis, there is evidence that the icebergs have averaged depth greater
than 270 m.
$BR
$BR

(i) In rejecting the null hypothesis, it is possible a type I error is being
made.
