McBeans magazine recently published a news article about caffeine
consumption in universities that claims that 80$PERCENT of people at
universities drink coffee regularly. Moonbucks, a popular coffee chain, is
interested in opening a new store on UBC campus. After reading McBeans'
article, they will consider opening a store in UBC if more than 80% of the
people in UBC drink coffee regularly. A random sample of people from UBC
was taken, and it was found that 680 out of 810 survey participants
considered themselves as regular coffee drinkers. Does Moonbucks' survey
result provide sufficient evidence to support opening a store at UBC?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(i) The parameter is the population proportion of all UBC
people who drink coffee regularly. 
$BR
$BR

(ii) The claim of the article will be negated by a higher
proportion of UBC people than claimed drinking coffee regularly. Hence a
one-sided alternative is reasonable. 
$BR
$BR

(iii) The low P-value suggests data that are unlikely if the article's
claim is true. 
$BR
$BR

(iv) Since the P-value is lower than 5%, we reject the null
hypothesis at the 5% significance level.There is sufficient
evidence to support opening a store at UBC.
$BR
$BR

(v) A type II error occurs when a null hypothesis that is false is not
rejected by the test. In this scenario, a type II error would occur if the
true proportion is greater than 80% but the test does not reject the null
hypothesis of the proportion being 80%.
$BR
$BR

(vi) As the null hypothesis is rejected, we are only in danger of
making a type I error. Type II errors occur when a null hypothesis that is
false is not rejected.
