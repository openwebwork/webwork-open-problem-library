BEGIN_TEXT
 According to Statistics Canada's 2006 "Participation
and Activity Limitation Survey," out of a Canadian
population of 25.4 million aged 15 and over, 1.3 million people have some
hearing loss. The study also suggested that 19% of Canadians with some
degree of hearing loss use an assistive device such as a hearing aid. Let us
suppose that a new study takes a simple random sample of size @n[0] from all
Canadians over 15 with hearing loss and that within this sample, @m[0] people
use some assistive device.

(e) Suppose Statistics Canada repeatedly took samples of size @n[0] from the
population of Canadians over the age of 15 with hearing loss. Assuming the
conditions in (d), in approximately what percentage (to two decimal places)
of such samples would you expect to see the proportion of individuals in the
sample using assistive devices being greater than 0.25? \{ ans_rule(6) \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The proportion of Canadians over 15 who have some
degree of hearing loss and who use an assistive device for their hearing is
a parameter of interest. 
$BR
$BR

(b) We require the random sample is no larger than 10% of the
population size (the 10% rule, otherwise the sampling distribution of the
sample proportion is different from the results used here), sufficient
proportions in the sample both with and without the characteristic of
interest to satisfy the "success/failure"
assumption (which seems fine here since we have @m[0]>10  
using a hearing device, and @n[0]-@m[0]>10), and the sample
was taken at random from the population of interest. 
$BR
$BR
(c) The sample proportion is @m[0]/@n[0]. 
$BR
$BR
(d) Under the hypothesis the population proportion \(\pi\) is
0.19, the sample proportion will be approximately Normal with mean 0.19 and
standard deviation
\[
\sqrt{\pi \left( 1-\pi \right) / 150}=\sqrt{0.19\times 0.81/150}=0.03.
\]
$BR
$BR
(e) By the Normal approximation and the 68-95-99.7 rule, we can figure
this out: 0.25 is two standard deviations above the mean since \(
0.19+2\times 0.03=0.25\). So, since 95% of the time, the sample
proportion will be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 5% of the
time time it will be either less than or greater than two standard
deviations away from the mean. Since we are asked about the times that the
sample proportion will exceed 0.25, we can halve 5% and see that 2.5% of
the time when we take a sample of 150 Canadians over 15 with hearing loss,
we will get a sample that has more than 25% of the individuals using
assistive devices.
