Suppose we are looking at a large database of the English language
such as the IPhOD dictionary (Vaden \(et~al\). 2009). For any word we
select, there is an 81% probability that it starts with a consonant and a
19% probability that it starts with a vowel. If it starts with a consonant,
there is a 21% chance that the second sound is also a consonant, while if
the word starts with a vowel, there is a 99% chance that the second sound
is a consonant. (These probabilities were calculated using the
"Phonological Search" function of the
free software Phonological CorpusTools, by Hall \(et~al\). 2015). Give
answers to the following to two decimals places.

(a) Construct a tree diagram here to illustrate the outcomes and their
associated probabilities. Hence or otherwise find the percentage of words in
English having both the first two sounds as vowel sounds. \{ ans_rule(6) \}

(b) A word chosen at random is found to have a consonant as its second

 (a)  With C denoting consonant and V vowel,
we have
$BCENTER
\{

\}
$ECENTER
$BR
Hence, or otherwise, the percentage of words having their first two
sounds as vowels is 0.2%.

(b) What we want to know is the P(Sound1 is a C | Sound 2 is a C),
that is, what is the probability that
sound 1 is a consonant, given that we know that sound 2 is a consonant? We
can use Bayes' Theorem, for which we need to know the probabilities that
sound 1 is a C or V, and the conditional probabilities of {Sound2 is a C}, given either that sound 1 is a C or that sound 1 is a V. We get the basic
probabilities of sound 1's being a C or a V from the text or the diagram: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{Sound1 is a C}) &=& 0.81, \\
P(\text{Sound1 is a }V) &=& 0.19.
\end{eqnarray*}
We get the relevant conditional probabilities from reading the diagram:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{Sound2 is a C}|\text{Sound1 is a C}) &=& 0.170 \\
P(\text{Sound2 is a C}|\text{Sound1 is a V}) &=& 0.188.
\end{eqnarray*}
Then we use Bayes' Theorem to find P(Sound1 is a C} | Sound2 is a C) as follows

\begin{align*}
& \frac{P(\text{Sound2 is a C} |\text{Sound1 is a C} )\times P(
\text{Sound1 is a C})}{P(\text{ Sound2 is a C} |\text{Sound1
is a C})\times P(\text{Sound1 is a C})+P(\text{Sound2 is a C} |\text{Sound1 is a V})\times P(\text{Sound1 is a V})} \\
&= \frac{0.17\times
0.81}{0.17\times 0.81+0.188\times 0.19} \\
&= 0.84.
\end{align*}

Hence there is an 84% chance that the first sound was a consonant if
we know that the second sound is a consonant.
