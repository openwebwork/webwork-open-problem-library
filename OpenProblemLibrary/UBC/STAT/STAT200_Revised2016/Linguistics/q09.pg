BEGIN_TEXT
 It is thought that approximately 1 out of every 600 babies will be
born with an orofacial cleft (cleft lip or cleft palate; see Little \(et~al\). 2004). Suppose a study is done of 10,000 newborns whose mothers who
smoked regularly during their pregnancy, and it is found that there are 
@m[0] babies with an orofacial cleft. The researchers believe that
smoking during pregnancy may increase the chance of the mother giving birth
to a baby with an orofacial cleft.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The proportion of babies born with an orofacial cleft
whose mothers smoked regularly during their pregnancy is the parameter of
interest.
$BR
$BR

(b) The null hypothesis is that the proportion of babies born with an
orofacial cleft whose mothers smoked regularly during their pregnancy equals
1/600, the same as the proportion in the general population.
$BR
$BR

(c) The alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of babies born
with an orofacial cleft whose mothers smoked regularly during their
pregnancy is greater than 1/600, since the researchers believe that smoking
may increase the risk of the condition. 
$BR
$BR

(d) Under the hypothesis the population proportion \(\pi \) is 1/600,
the sample proportion will be approximately Normal with mean 1/600 and
standard deviation
\[
\sqrt{\pi \left( 1-\pi \right) /10000}=\sqrt{1/600\times 599/600/10000}.
\]
$BR
$BR

(e) The z-score here is the standardised value of the sample
proportion, this being
\[
\frac{@phat[0]-1/600}{\sqrt{1/600\times 599/600/10000}}=@s5[0].
\]
$BR
$BR

(f) This is a one--sided test, with alternative hypothesis that \(\pi
>1/600.\) Hence high values of the sample proportion lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis, and the P-value is found by finding the
probability to the right of @phat[0] via the model in (d). By
software or tables, this is @s6[0]. 
$BR
$BR

(g) If the P-value from (f) is greater than 0.05, we can conclude
there is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that proportion of babies born
with an orofacial cleft whose mothers smoked regularly during their
pregnancy equals 1/600. Alternatively, if the P-value is less than 0.05,
there is reason to believe the proportion of babies born with an orofacial
cleft whose mothers smoked regularly during their pregnancy is greater than
1/600.
