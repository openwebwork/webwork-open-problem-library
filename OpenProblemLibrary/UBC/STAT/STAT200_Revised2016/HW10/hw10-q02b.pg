A researcher for Agri-Giant Corporation wants to study how many pounds
of tomatoes are typically picked by a manual labourer in an 8-hour
day. The Corporation will consider using picking machines if the
labourers cannot pick at least 240 pounds, on average. The researcher
randomly sampled 100 farm labourers, found out how many pounds of
tomatoes each picked and calculated the sample mean and standard
deviation.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameters of concern relate to a population of
interest, not to the data collected. 
$BR
$BR
(b) The null hypothesis asserts a default value on a parameter of
interest, the default value of the mean weight of tomatoes picked by the
manual workers per eight hour day being 240 lbs.

$BR
$BR
(c)  It is proposed that a machine will replace the workers if they
cannot pick at least an average of 240 lbs per day, suggesting a one-sided,
left-tailed alternative. That is, we test \(H_{0}:\mu =240\) against \(
H_{A}:\mu <240,\) where \(\mu \) is the mean weight picked per
working day by the manual workers.
$BR
$BR
(d)  If we reject the null hypothesis, there is evidence that the
workers on average pick less than 240 lbs per working day.
$BR
$BR
(e) In rejecting the null hypothesis, it is possible a type I error is
being made.
$BR
$BR
(f) The relatively low P-value tells us that if indeed the mean amount
picked by the population of workers is 240 lbs, the sample of workers
performed appreciably worse than this average.
$BR
$BR
(g) As the P-value is less than a significance level of either 0.05 or
0.1, we would reject the null hypothesis at those two significance levels.
