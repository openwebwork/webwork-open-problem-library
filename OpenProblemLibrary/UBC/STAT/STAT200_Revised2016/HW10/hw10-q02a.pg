The time taken for healthy Canadian adults to complete a logic problem
is believed to be Normally distributed with mean 40 seconds and
standard deviation 4 seconds. It is of interest to investigate whether
UBC students perform better on average than healthy adult Canadians,
so the logic problem is given to a sample of 80 UBC students, and
their times to solution are recorded.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameters of concern relate to a population of
interest, not to the data collected. 
$BR
$BR
(b) The null hypothesis asserts a default value on a parameter of
interest, the default value in this case being the mean time for healthy
Canadian adults which is given as 40 secs.

$BR
$BR
(c) It is suggested that UBC students may perform better on average
than the Canadian adult population, suggesting a one-sided, left-tailed
alternative. That is, we test \(H_{0}: \mu =40\) against \(H_{A}:\mu <40,\) where \(\mu\) is the mean time to solve the problem for UBC
students.
$BR
$BR
(d) If we reject the null hypothesis, there is evidence that UBC
students over average solve problem quicker than healthy Canadian adults. 
$BR
$BR
(e) In rejecting the null hypothesis, it is possible a type I error is
being made.
$BR
$BR
(f) The relatively low P-value tells us that if indeed the mean time
to solve the problem for UBC students is 40 secs, the sample of UBC students performed appreciably better than this average.
$BR
$BR
(g) As the P-value is less than a significance level of either 0.05 or
0.1, we would reject the null hypothesis at those two significance levels.
