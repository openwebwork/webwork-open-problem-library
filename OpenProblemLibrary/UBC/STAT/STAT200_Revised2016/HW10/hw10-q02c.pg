From previous studies, it has been generally believed that Northern
Hemisphere icebergs have a mean depth of 270 meters and a standard
deviation of 20 meters. An environmentalist has suggested that global
warming has caused icebergs to have greater depth. A team of
scientists visiting the Northern Hemisphere observed a random sample
of 41 icebergs. The depth of the base of the iceberg below the surface
was carefully measured for each and the sample mean and standard
deviation were calculated.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(a) The parameters of concern relate to a population of
interest, not to the data collected. 
$BR
$BR
(b) The null hypothesis asserts a default value on a parameter of
interest, the default value in this case of the mean depth of icebergs in
the northern hemisphere is the previously suggested value of 270 m.

$BR
$BR
(c)It is proposed that the mean depth of the population of icebergs
may have increased over time, suggesting a one-sided, right-tailed
alternative. That is, we test \(H_{0}:\mu =270\) against \(H_{A}:\mu
>270,\) where \(\mu \) is the mean depth of northern hemisphere
icebergs. 

$BR
$BR
(d)  If we reject the null hypothesis, there is evidence that the
icebergs have averaged depth greater than 270 m.
$BR
$BR
(e) In rejecting the null hypothesis, it is possible a type I error is
being made.
$BR
$BR
(f) The relatively low P-value tells us that if indeed the mean depth
of northern hemisphere icebergs is 270 m, the sample of icebergs must have
been on average appreciably deeper than 270 m. 
$BR
$BR
(g) As the P-value is less than a significance level of either 0.05 or
0.1, we would reject the null hypothesis at those two significance levels.
