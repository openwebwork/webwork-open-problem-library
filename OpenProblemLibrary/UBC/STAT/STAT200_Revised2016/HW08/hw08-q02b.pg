A report says that 82$PERCENT of British Columbians over the age of 25 are high school graduates. A survey of randomly selected residents of a certain city included 1290 who were over the age of 25, and 1135 of them were high school graduates. Does the survey result provide sufficient evidence to contradict the reported value, 82$PERCENT?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(i) The parameter is the population proportion of all BC residents over 25 who are high school graduates.
$BR
$BR
(ii) The claim of the
report is negated by a proportion that is either smaller or higher than
that claimed. Hence a twoÂ-sided alternative is reasonable.
$BR
$BR
(iii) The low P-value suggests data that are unlikely if the reportÂs claim
is true.
$BR
$BR
(iv) Since the P-value is lower than 5%, we reject the null
hypothesis at the 5% significance level.
$BR
$BR
(v) Rejecting the null hypothesis does not prove the claim is false, but
does provide strong evidence against it.
$BR
$BR
(vi) A type II error occurs when a null hypothesis that is false is not
rejected by the test.
$BR
$BR
(vii) As the null hypothesis is rejected, we are only in danger of making
a type I error. Type II errors occurs when a null hypothesis that is false
is not rejected.
