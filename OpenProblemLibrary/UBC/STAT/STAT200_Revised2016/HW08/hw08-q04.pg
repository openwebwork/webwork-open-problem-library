## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
Prof. Johnson conducted a test with a two-sided alternative
hypothesis. Although the P-value reported was very low, there is no
indication as to whether the data were consistent with a proportion p 
lower or higher than 0.3. Hence from the information given it is
impossible to say whether a test with a one-sided alternative would lead to
rejection of the null hypothesis.
