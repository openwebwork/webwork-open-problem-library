BlueSky Air claims that at least 80$PERCENT of its flights arrive on time. A random sample of 
160 BlueSky Air flights revealed that 115 arrive on time. Do the data provide sufficient 
evidence to contradict the claim by BlueSky Air?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
(i) The parameter is the population proportion of all BlueSky flights arriving on time. 
$BR
$BR
(ii) The claim of the company is not sensibly
negated by a higher proportion of flights than claimed arriving on time.
Hence a one-sided alternative is reasonable.
$BR
$BR
(iii) The low P-value suggests data that are unlikely if the companys
claims are true. 
$BR
$BR
(iv) Since the P-value is lower than 1%, we reject the
null hypothesis at the 1% significance level.
$BR
$BR
(v) Rejecting the null hypothesis does not prove the claim is false, but
does provide strong evidence against it.
$BR
$BR
(vi) A type I error occurs when a null hypothesis that is true is rejected
by the test.
$BR
$BR
(vii) As the null hypothesis is rejected, we are only in danger of making
a type I error. Type II errors occurs when a null hypothesis that is false
is not rejected.
