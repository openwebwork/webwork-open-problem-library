A report says that @p[0] % of British Columbians over the age of 25 are high
school graduates. A survey of randomly selected residents of a certain
city included @n[0] who were over the age of 25, and 1012 of them were
high school graduates. Is the citys result of 1012 unusually high, low,
or neither?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
Let \(X\) denote the number of residents in the 
@n[0] that are high school graduates. Then \(\hat{p}=X/@n[0]\)
is the sample proportion of over 25's who are high school graduates,
and given that we can assume that the population proportion is 
\(p=@p[0]/100,\) 

we know by the Central Limit Theorem that \(\hat{p}\) is
approximately Normally distributed with mean @p[0]/100 = @mean[0] and
standard deviation 

\( \sqrt{\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100}\right) (\mathtt{@p[0]/100})/@n[0] }= @sd[0].\)

Then with Z denoting a standard Normal variable, the
probability that the sample proportion is less than \(1012/\texttt{@n[0]} \) is
approximately
\begin{eqnarray*}
P\left( \hat{p}\leq 1012/\mathtt{@n[0]}\right)  
&\approx & 
P\left( Z<\left( \frac{1012/\mathtt{@n[0]}-\mathtt{@p[0]/100}}
{ \sqrt{\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100}\right) (\mathtt{@p[0]/100})/@n[0]} }\right) \right)  \\
&=&P\left( Z<\mathtt{@z[0]}\right) 
\end{eqnarray*} 
which is very small. Hence the observed value of  \(1012/\texttt{@n[0]} \) is
far into the lower tail of the distribution, and looks unusually small.

$BR
Alternatively, we have that 
\(
X \sim Bin\left( \mathtt{@n[0],@p[0]/100}\right) ,
\)
and by the Normal approximation to the Binomial,
approximately \(X\) is Normal with mean \( @n[0] \times @p[0]/100=@mean2[0] \) and
variance 
\( @n[0] \times @p[0]/100 \left( 1-\mathtt{@p[0]/100}\right) =@sd2[0].\) 

Then with Z denoting a standard Normal variable,
\begin{eqnarray*}
P\left( X\leq 1012\right)  &\approx &P\left( Z<\left( \frac{1012-\mathtt{
@n[0] \times @p[0]/100}}{\sqrt{@n[0] \times @p[0]/100 \left(1-@p[0]/100\right) }}\right)
\right)  \\
&=&P\left( Z<\mathtt{@z[0]}\right) 
\end{eqnarray*}
which is very small. Hence the observed value of 1012 is far into the
lower tail of the distribution, and looks unusually small.
