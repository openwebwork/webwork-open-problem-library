TEXT(beginproblem());

#######
BEGIN_TEXT
BlueSky Air has the best on-time arrival rate with @p[0]% of
its flights arriving on time. A test is conducted by randomly
selecting @n[0] BlueSky Air flights and observing whether they arrive on time.

$PAR
What is the probability that two flights of BlueSky Air arrive late? 
(Please carry answers to at least six decimal places in intermediate steps. 
Give your final answer to the nearest three decimal places).    

$PAR
Probability (as a proportion) \{ ans_rule(6) \}

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
 Let \(X\) denote the number of flights in the \(@n[0]\)
 that arrive late. Assuming the flights are independent of each
other and each is late with probability \(1-@p[0]/100=@tem[0], \) 
then 
$BR
\(
P\left( X=2\right) =\binom{@n[0]}{2}\left( 1-@p[0]/100\right)
^{2}\left( @p[0]/100 \right) ^{@n[0]-2}=@ans[0]. 
\)
