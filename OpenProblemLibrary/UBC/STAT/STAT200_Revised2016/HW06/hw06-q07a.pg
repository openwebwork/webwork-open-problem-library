BEGIN_PGML
The weights of cans of Ocean brand tuna are supposed to have a net weight of
6 ounces. The manufacturer tells you that the net weight is actually a
Normal random variable with a mean of 5.95 ounces and a standard deviation
of 0.2 ounces. Suppose that you draw a random sample of 42 cans.

*Part i)*

Suppose the number of cans drawn is doubled. How will the standard deviation
of sample mean weight change?

[_]{$radio1}

*Part ii)*

Suppose the number of cans drawn is doubled. How will the mean of the
sample mean weight change?

[_]{$radio2}

*Part iii)*

Consider the statement: 'The distribution of the mean weight of the sampled
cans of Ocean brand tuna is Normal.'

[_]{$radio3}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The distribution of the weight of a single can of tuna is given
to be Normal with mean 5.95 oz. and standard deviation 0.2 oz.

(i) The sample mean weight of a sample of 42 such cans is a random
variable that follows the Normal distribution with mean 5.95 and standard
deviation [`0.2/\sqrt{42}`]. If we were to double the sample size to 84,
the standard deviation of the sample mean would decrease by a factor
of [`\sqrt{2}`].

(ii) Changing the sample size does not affect the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample mean, which would remain at 5.95.

(iii) The sample mean here is normally distributed, though there is no
need to apply the Central Limit Theorem for this result. Instead, the
result follows exactly since the distribution of the weights of the
individual cans is Normal.
