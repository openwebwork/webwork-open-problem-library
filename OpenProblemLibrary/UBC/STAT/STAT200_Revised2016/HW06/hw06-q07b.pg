BEGIN_TEXT
An HP laser printer is advertised to print text documents at a speed of 18 ppm (pages per minute). The manufacturer tells you that the printing speed is actually a Normal random variable with a mean of 17.57 ppm and a standard deviation of 3 ppm. Suppose that you draw a random sample of 11 printers.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
The distribution of the printing speed of a single printer is
given to be Normal with mean 17.57 ppm. and standard deviation 3 ppm. 
$BR
$BR
(i) The sample mean speed of a sample of 11 such printers is a random
variable that follows the Normal distribution with mean 17.57 and standard
deviation \( 3/\sqrt{11} \). If we were to quadruple the sample size to 44, the
standard deviation of the sample mean would decrease by a factor of 2.
$BR
$BR
(ii) Changing the sample size does not affect the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample mean, which would remain at 17.57. 
$BR
$BR
(iii) The sample mean here is normally distributed, though there is no
need to apply the Central Limit Theorem for this result. Instead, the
result follows exactly since the distribution of the printing speed of the
individual printers is Normal.
