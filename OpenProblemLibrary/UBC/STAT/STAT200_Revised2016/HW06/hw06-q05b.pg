BEGIN_TEXT
A study claims that @p[0] % of children under the age of 13 in British
Columbia have been vaccinated from the chicken pox. A survey of
randomly selected residents of a certain city included @n[0] children who
were under the age of 13, and 197 of them were not vaccinated. Is the
city's result of 197 unusually high, low, or neither?

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
 Let X denote the number of children under 13 in the 
@n[0] that are not vaccinated. Then 
\(
\hat{p}=X/@n[0]
\)
is the sample proportion who are not vaccinated, and given that we can
assume that the population proportion is 
\(
p=1-@p[0]/100,
\)
we know by the Central Limit Theorem that 
\(
\hat{p}
\)
is approximately Normally distributed with mean 
\(
1-@p[0]/100
\)
and standard deviation 
\(
\sqrt{\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100}\right) (\mathtt{@p[0]}/100) / @n[0]}=@sd[0]. 
\)

Then with Z denoting a standard Normal variable, the probability
that the sample proportion is less than 197/@n[0] is approximately

\begin{eqnarray*}
P\left( \hat{p}\geq 197/\mathtt{@n[0]}\right)  &\approx &P\left( Z>\left( \frac{
197/\mathtt{@n[0]}-\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100}\right) }
{\sqrt{\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100} \right) (\mathtt{@p[0]}/100)/@n[0]}}\right) \right)  \\
&=&P\left( Z>\mathtt{@z[0]}\right) 
\end{eqnarray*}

which is very small. Hence the observed value of 197/@n[0] is far into the
upper tail of the distribution, and looks unusually high.

Alternatively, we have that 
\(
X\sim Bin\left( \mathtt{@n[0],1-@p[0]/100}\right) ,
\)

and by the Normal approximation to the Binomial,
approximately X is Normal with mean 
\(
\texttt{@n[0]} \left( 1-\mathtt{@p[0]}/100 \right) = @mean2[0] 
\) 
and variance 
\(
@n[0] \times @p[0]/100 \left( 
1-@p[0]/100\right) = @sd2[0].
\)
Then with Z denoting a standard Normal variable,

\begin{eqnarray*}
P\left( X\geq 197\right)  &\approx &P\left( Z>\left( \frac{197-\mathtt{@n[0]}
\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100}\right) }{\sqrt{\mathtt{@n[0] \times @p[0]/100}\left( \mathtt{1-@p[0]/100}
\right) }}\right) \right)  \\
&=&P\left( Z>\mathtt{@z[0]}\right) 
\end{eqnarray*}

which is very small. Hence the observed value of 197 is far into the
upper tail of the distribution, and looks unusually high.
