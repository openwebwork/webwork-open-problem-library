## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
The sum of the residuals is always zero in a
regression fit, however well the model fits the data. It is not always easy
to decide by looking just at the scatter plot and fitted line how well the
model fits the data. The plot of residuals (against either the fitted values
or the explanatory variable, \(X\)) gives a clearer picture of the
model fit.
