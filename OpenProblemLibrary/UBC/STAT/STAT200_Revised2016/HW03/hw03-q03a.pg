## Solution (Optional but recommended)

BEGIN_SOLUTION
There is nothing in the question that suggests the model is
a good fit to the data and that, for instance, the model could sensibly be
used for prediction. Note also that the slope of the regression line tells
us nothing about the correlation other than its sign.
