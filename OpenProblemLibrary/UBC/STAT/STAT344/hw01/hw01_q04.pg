BEGIN_SOLUTION
The estimate will typically be an overestimate. Since every individual has an equal chance of being sampled, larger households are more
likely to be represented in the sample. For instance, if your household has five members while mine has only one, then it is  five times more likely that
someone from your household gets sampled than it is that someone from my
household gets sampled.
