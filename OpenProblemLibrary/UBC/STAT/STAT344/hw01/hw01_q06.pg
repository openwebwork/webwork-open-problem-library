In Ontario, public-sector employers are required to make public the
salaries of all employees earning more than $100,000 per year (this is
often referred to as the "sunshine list"). Say you have been tasked with
estimating the average salaries of employees in a segment of the public-
sector. For instance, say that all employees of Ontario universities
is your target population. To start, from basic information provided
by the universities, you know the size of your target population is $N[0]
employees. Next, you consult the sunshine list and find that $N1[0] of
these employees are listed there, with those listed having an average
salary of $$A[0] per year. Then you are able to collect information from a
simple random sample of 100 of those university employees not on the sunshine list. The mean income in those sampled is $$B[0] per year, with a
standard deviation of $7,000. Provide answers to the following to two
decimal places.

## Solution (Optional but recommended)
Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD (a) $EBOLD The population has two parts - "non-sunshine" and "sunshine".
From the survey data we estimate the mean income in the first part, 
\( \bar{y}_{P, 1} \) by the sample mean \( \bar{y}_{S, 1} = \) $$B[0], with a 95% 
confidence interval being $ (\($B[0] \pm 1.96 \times 7000/10 \)). We also have that the mean income in the whole population must be
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
\bar{y}_{P} = (1-\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times \bar{y}_{P, 1} +  (\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times \bar{y}_{P, 2} 
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR
where \( \bar{y}_{P, 1} \) is the mean salary of the "sunshine" group. So we estimate this
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
 (1-\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times \bar{y}_{S, 1} +  (\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times \bar{y}_{P, 2}
=$q1ans
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
dollars. 
$BR
$BR



$BBOLD (b) $EBOLD We can input the endpoints of the confidence interval for 
\( \bar{y}_{P,1} \) into the estimator found in (a) to yield a 95% confidence interval for \( \bar{y}_{P} \), 
$BR
$BR
$BCENTER
\(
( (1-\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times ($B[0] -1.96 \times 7000/10 ) +  (\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times \bar{y}_{P, 2},  (1-\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times ($B[0] + 1.96 \times 7000/10 ) +  (\frac{$N1[0]}{$N[0]}) \times \bar{y}_{P, 2} ) = (  $q2ans, $q3ans ). 
\)
$ECENTER
$BR
$BR

 


$BBOLD (c) $EBOLD Yes, any subset of those not on the sunshine list would have the same chance of being picked. (Though the plot thickens a bit in that you would
choose a sample size initially without knowing what the final sample size will
be, i.e., in advance you do not know exactly how many responses you will
discard.)
