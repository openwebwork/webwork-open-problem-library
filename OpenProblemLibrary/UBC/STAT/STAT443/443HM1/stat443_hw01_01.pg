At the end of 2007, a Washington State property developer was interested in predicting the demand for homes in Seattle. He considered only recent data was worth examining, and so looked at quarterly home sales in the city between 2004 and 2007 inclusive. Suppose the data are as in the file provided for download below:
$BR
$BBOLD LINK for DATA SET (\{ htmlLink($local_url, "Download the csv file here") \}) $EBOLD
$BR
$BR

$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
\{ $q1mc -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $q1mc -> print_a() \}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
Use the $BBOLD rollmean $EBOLD function to smooth the data, using a suitable lag and centering the new series. What is the third value of your smoothed series? Give your answer to two decimal places.
$BR
\{ans_rule(7)\}
$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c)  $EBOLD
Via smoothing and the estimation of any observed components in the series using the data provided, the developer estimated the quarterly home sales for 2008, and based his business plan for the year on those forecasts. Some years later, looking back on how his forecasts had been so inaccurate, he obtained data for total home sales by quarter in Seattle from 2008 to 2013. The data are available to download below:
$BR
$BBOLD LINK for DATA SET (\{ htmlLink($local_url1, "Download the csv file here") \}) $EBOLD

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BBOLD Part (a) $EBOLD
The series has no clear trend, but exhibits a seasonal effect of period 4.
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b) $EBOLD
The value is found using the following code in R
$BR
> smoothSeattle0407 <- rollmean(SeattleHomes0407$Seattle,k=4)
$BR
> smoothSeattle0407[3]
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c) $EBOLD
There had been a change in the mean of the underlying process.
The shift coincides with the property crash in the USA.
