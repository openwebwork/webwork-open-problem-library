## Setup: this is where we use Perl and PG objects (Required)

$q1mc = new_multiple_choice();
$q1mc -> qa(

"Invertible."

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$BR
$BBOLD Part (a)  $EBOLD
The series exhibits a change in behaviour around 1994, when the apparent trend appears to increase dramatically. Models encountered will not handle such situations. 

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (b)  $EBOLD
The series appears to have nonconstant variance. (1 mark, no mark deducted if possible trend mentioned, though no mark for that alone). We could add a constant then either square root or take logs. (2 marks, –1 if adding constant omitted)


$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (c)  $EBOLD
The acf is not decaying – too many significant values at high lags. It appears that there may be a seasonal effect of period twelve months. (2 marks) The pacf also does not look consistent with a stationary series, with significant values at high lags.

$BR
$BR
$BBOLD Part (d)  $EBOLD
No, the series does not appear to be stationary.
