Suppose that you have two consumption choices: good X, and good Y.  An indifference curve is the set of consumption choices with a CONSTANT utility.  For example if consuming 10X and 6Y gives me the same utility as consuming 11X and 5Y, then these are both points on the same indifference curve.  An indifference map is the set of all indifference curves with EVERY given utility.  
$PAR
Consider the indifference map given by:
$BR \(U = XY\) , where \(U\) is a measure of utility.

$PAR  A budget curve gives the set of possible consumption choices with a given income.  If you have an income of $$i and the price of good X is given by \(p_x\), and the price of good Y given by \(p_y\).  The equation for the budget line is given by: \($i = p_x X + p_y Y\).

$PAR
A utility maximizing combination of goods X and Y occurs when the budget line is tangent to a indifference curve.  

$PAR
Find X as a function of its price. (If Y represents all other goods, than this function is just a demand curve for X).

$PAR \(X = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR (Use px for \(p_x\))

$PAR Let \(X_0\) and \(U_0\) be the values for X and U when \(p_x = $px\) and \(p_y = $py\).
$BR \(X_0 = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR \(U_0 = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}

       $PAR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD Manipulate the budget line and indifference map to get them as a function of Y.  To find the point where the curves are tangent to each other, you need to find a point where both their slopes and coordinates are equal.  This will give two equations.  Manipulate these equations to isolate X as a function \(p_x\).

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Manipulating the indifference map and budget function we get:
$BR \(Y = \frac{U}{X}\)
$PAR \(Y = \frac{$i}{p_y} -\frac{p_x}{p_y}X\).

$PAR Taking the derivatives of each, we get:
$BR \(\frac{dY}{dX} = -\frac{U}{X^2}\)
$PAR \(\frac{dY}{dX} = -\frac{p_x}{p_y}\).

$PAR Now we get the two equations:
$BR \( -\frac{U}{X^2} = -\frac{p_x}{p_y}\)
$PAR \(\frac{U}{X} = \frac{$i}{p_y} -\frac{p_x}{p_y}X\).

$PAR With a little bit of algebra we get: 
$BR \(X = \frac{$i}{2 p_x} \)
$PAR \(U = \frac{$i2}{2 p_x p_y} \).

$PAR Therefore:
$BR \(X = $x\)
$PAR \(U = $u\).
