\(f(x) = $p - $ny (1+r)^{-$n1}\)

$PAR
Recall that the Newton-Raphson method is: \(r_{n+1} = r_n - \frac{f(r)}{f'(r)}\).
$BR 

Therefore:  \(r_{n+1} = r_n - \frac{Y-Y(1+r_n)^{-N}-r_nP}{NY(1+r_n)^{-N-1}-P}\) and,
$BR \(r_1 = $r1\),
$BR \(r_2 = $r2\).

$PAR 
Therefore the annual interest rate is $ans2 %.
