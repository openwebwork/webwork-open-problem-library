Shark Inc. has determined that demand for its newest netbook model is
given by \(\ln{q}-$a \ln{p} + $b p = 7\),
where q is the number of netbooks Shark can sell at a price of p
dollars per unit. Shark
has determined that this model is valid for prices \(p \ge 100\). You
may ﬁnd it useful in this
problem to know that elasticity of demand is deﬁned to be \( E(p) =
\frac{dq}{dp}\frac{p}{q}\)

$PAR
Find \(E(p) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR Your answer should only be in terms of \(p\).

$PAR
What price will maximize revenue.  If the price is less than 100, write 'NA'.
$BR \(p = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
EOT
Context()->normalStrings;

$ans1 = Formula("-($b*p -$a)");

$ans2 = Compute("((1+$a)/$b)");


if($ans2<100) {
$ans2 = Compute("NA"); }


ANS($ans1->cmp(limits=>[-100,100]));
ANS($ans2->cmp());

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Use the rules of implicit differentiation to differentiate the demand
function with respect to price to find:
$BR \(0=\frac{dq}{dp}\frac{1}{q}-\frac{$a}{p} + $b \).
$BR Subbing in the rearranged equation for elasticity you find:
$BR \(\frac{E}{p} -\frac{$a}{p} + $b = 0\), which can be rearranged
to get \(E= $a - $b p\).
$BR Revenue is maximized when \(E = -1\), which happens when \(p = $ans2\).
