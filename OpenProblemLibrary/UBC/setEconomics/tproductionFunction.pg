Suppose that a firm uses both labour (X) and capital (Y) to produce a certain good.  An isoquant is a curve made up of the set of points \((X,Y)\) that gives the same level of output.  For example, if 10 units of labour and 6 units of capital produce the same output as 11 units of labour and 5 units of capital, than (10,6) and (11,5) are on the same isoquant.  The production function is the set of all isoquants given any level of output.
  
$PAR
The Cobb-Douglas production function is a simple example:
$BR \(q = X^{\alpha}Y^{\alpha-1}\) , where \(0 \le \alpha \le 1\) .

$PAR The cost function gives the cost of using a given combination of labour and capital.   If \(p_x\) is the cost of using labour and \(p_y\) is the cost of using capital then: \(C =  p_x X + p_y Y\).  A set of points with a constant cost is known as an isocost.


$PAR
To minimize cost given a certain level of output, an isocost will be tangent to an an isoquant.  This is not the same situation as with utility maximization where the total income was fixed.  Here, you are minimizing cost for a given level of output.

$PAR
Let \(\alpha = .5\), \(p_x = $px\) and \(p_y = $py\).
$BR Suppose the firm wants to produce \(Q\) units.  Find the cost minimizing amount of labour and capital to use as a function of \(Q\).
$BR \(X = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR \(Y = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

$PAR

Now, express the cost of production as a function of output (Q).  Note that this will be the long run cost function.

$BR \(C = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

       $PAR $BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD To find the point where the curves are tangent to each other, you need to find a point where both their slopes and coordinates are equal. To find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) you will need to use the rules of implicit differentiation and the fact that \(\frac{dQ}{dx} = 0\). You will also have an expression for \(\frac{dY}{dX}\) from the cost function.  Here too you will use the fact that on an isocost \(\frac{dC}{dx} = 0\).  You need use your two expressions for \(\frac{dY}{dX}\) to isolate for a variable which you can substitute into the production function.

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Using the rules of implicit differentiation we get:
$BR \(\frac{dQ}{dx} = \alpha X^{\alpha -1}Y^{1-\alpha}+(1-\alpha)X^{\alpha}Y^{-\alpha}\frac{dY}{dX}\)
$PAR \(0 = \alpha X^{\alpha -1}Y^{1-\alpha}+(1-\alpha)X^{\alpha}Y^{-\alpha}\frac{dY}{dX}\)
$PAR \(\frac{dY}{dX} = -\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)\).

$PAR 
Similarly, we know that on an isocost \(\frac{dC}{dx} = 0\),
$BR \(C = X p_x + Y p_y\) 
$BR \(\frac{dC}{dX} = p_x + p_y \frac{dY}{dX}\)
$PAR \(\frac{dY}{dX} = - \frac{p_x}{p_y}\)


$PAR
For an isoquant curve to be tangent to an isocost their slopes have to be equal:
$BR \(\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)\)
$PAR  \(\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \frac{Y}{X}\) for \(\alpha = .5\)
$PAR \(Y = X\frac{p_x}{p_y}\)


$PAR Subbing back into the production function:
$BR \(Q = X^{.5}\left(X\frac{p_y}{p_x}\right)^{.5}\)
$BR \(X = Q\sqrt{\frac{p_y}{p_x}}\)
$BR \(X = $pypx Q\)

$PAR Using a similar argument:
$BR \(Y = Q\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)\)
$BR \(Y = $pxpy Q\)

$PAR Remember the cost function was: \(C = X p_x + Y p_y\)
$BR \(C = $pypx Q ($px) + $pxpy Q ($py)\)
$BR \(C = $c Q + $c Q\)
$BR \(C = $cxy Q\)
