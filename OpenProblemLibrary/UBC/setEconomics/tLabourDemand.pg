In this question you will derive a simple labour demand curve.

$PAR

Suppose that the number of calculators a firm can produce per hour (TP) given a certain number of workers (L), is given by:

\[TP = $a\ln(L+$b)+$c L\]

$BR The cost of using each worker is just their hourly wage (w).  So the total labour cost is \(C = w L\).

$PAR

If the price of each calculator is $$p, find the profit maximizing wage as a function of number of workers used (L).
$BR \(w = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Total profit \(P\) can be expressed by \(P = Revenue - Costs\).  Revenue is just the total number of outputs multiplied by the price of the output.  In this case \(Revenue = $p TP\).  

$PAR
So in this example:
$BR \(P = $p($a\ln(L+$b) + $c x) - wL\).

$PAR 

To find the profit maximizing level of output we need to find: \(\frac{dP}{dL} = 0\).
$BR \(\frac{dP}{dL}  = $p(\frac{$a}{L+$b}+$c)-w\)
$BR \(0 = $p(\frac{$a}{L+$b}+$c)-w\)
$PAR \(w = $p(\frac{$a}{L+$b}+$c)\).

$PAR $BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD \(\frac{d}{dL}(Revenue)\) is known as the marginal revenue product of labour.
