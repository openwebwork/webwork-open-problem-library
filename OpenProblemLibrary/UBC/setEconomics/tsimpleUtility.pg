A util is the unit of utility measuring satisfaction or happiness.  Assume that you have two consumption choices: gum and chocolate - each the same price.  Each piece of chocolate will give you 4 utils of utility.  The utility schedule of gum is given below.  If you want maximize utility how many pieces of gum should you consume per day? \{ans_rule(10)\}.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
We have to look for the point where the utility gained from an additional piece of gum (marginal utility) is less than the utility gained from a piece of chocolate (4 utils).

By inspection we can see that moving from 5-6 pieces of gum per day increases utility by 6 utils, but moving from 6-7 utils increases utility by only 3.5 utils. Therefore, in this situation, the optimum number of pieces of gum to eat per day is 6.
