BEGIN_TEXT
A force that varies linearly with time according to a relation \( F = 4t \, N \) is applied to an object traveling with a speed of \( 16 m/s \). If the force decelerates the object to a complete stop in \( 5s \), determine the object's mass. Assume the force is initially zero and the mass travels in the horizontal plane.
