BEGIN_TEXT
An insulated, vertical piston-cylinder device initially
contains \($Mass_initial\) \(kg\) of water, \($Vapor_initial\) \(kg\) of which is in the vapor phase.
The mass of the piston is such that it maintains a constant pressure
of \(200\) \(kPa\) inside the cylinder. Now steam at \(0.5\) \(MPa\) and
\(350^{\circ}C\) is allowed to enter the cylinder from a supply line until
all the liquid in the cylinder has vaporized. Determine: $BR 
$SPACE 1. the initial enthalpy in the cylinder $BR 
$SPACE 2. the final enthalpy in the cylinder $BR 
$SPACE 3. the final temperature in the cylinder $BR 
$SPACE 4. the final mass of water inside the cylinder$BR 
$SPACE 5. the mass of steam that entered the cylinder$BR
