BEGIN_PGML
In thermodynamics, the symbol [`Q`] is usually used to represent the total heat transfer associated with a non-infinitesimal process. Considering this, and standard notation for transport equations in thermodynamics...

The term [`\delta Q`] represents:

[@ $mc->buttons() @]*

The term [`\text{d} Q`] represents:

[@ $mcB->buttons() @]*

The term [`\dot{Q}`] represents:

[@ $mcC->buttons() @]*

The term [`\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}Q`] represents:

[@ $mcCC->buttons() @]*

The term [`\Delta Q`] represents:

[@ $mcD->buttons() @]*
