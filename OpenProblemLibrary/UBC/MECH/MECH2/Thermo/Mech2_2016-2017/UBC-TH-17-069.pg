BEGIN_TEXT
An insulated piston-cylinder device initially contains
\($V_in\) \(L\) of air at \($P_in\) \(kPa\) and \($T_in ^{\circ}C\). Air is now heated for
\($t\) \(min\) by a \(200\) \(W\) resistance heater placed inside the cylinder.
The pressure of air is maintained constant during this
process. Assume a constant specific heat of \(Cp = 1.02\) \(kJ/kg\cdot K\)). $BR Determine: $BR

$SPACE 1. the mass of the air inside the cylinder $BR
$SPACE 2. th electrical work done during this process $BR
$SPACE 3. the final temperature $BR
$SPACE 4. the entropy change in air $PAR
