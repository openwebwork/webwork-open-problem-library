BEGIN_PGML

Liquid water at [`T = 200\,^\circ\text{C}`] is expanded isothermally from [`P = 40\,\text{MPa}`] until it is fully vaporized, then heated isochorically. Your task is to decide how this process should be illustrated on a [`P`]-[`v`] (*Pressure*-Specific Volume) diagram. The diagram is not intended to be to scale, but the relative positioning of points should be correct (e.g. points of high [`v`] should fall to the right of points of lower [`v`]). Several candidate process lines are illustrated below.
