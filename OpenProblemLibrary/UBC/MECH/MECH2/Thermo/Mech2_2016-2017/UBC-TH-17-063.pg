BEGIN_TEXT
Air at \(10^{\circ}C\) and \($P_inlet\) \(kPa\) enters the diffuser of a jet engine steadily with a velocity of \($V_inlet\) \(m/s\). The inlet area of the diffuser is \($A_inlet\) \(m^2\). The air leaves the diffuser with a velocity that is very small compared with the inlet velocity. (Assume \(Cp = 1.005\) and air is ideal gas). $BR Determine: $BR
$SPACE 1. Specific volume of the air at diffuser inlet $BR
$SPACE 2. the mass flow rate of the air $BR
$SPACE 3. the enthalpy of the air leaving the diffuser $BR
$SPACE 4. the temperature of the air leaving the diffuser $BR
