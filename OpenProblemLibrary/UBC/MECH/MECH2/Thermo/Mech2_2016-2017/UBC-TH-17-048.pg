BEGIN_PGML

A boiler produces steam at [`P = 2\,\text{MPa}`], [`T = 350\,\text{C}`]. This steam is run through an adiabatic turbine operating at steady state. The inlet stream of the turbine has a negligible velocity, but the outlet stream has a velocity of about [`[$v]\,\text{m/s}`]. The exhaust is at the same elevation as the inlet, and the working fluid leaves as a saturated mixture at atmospheric pressure [`P = 100\,\text{kPa}`] with quality [`[$x]`].

a. What is the specific work output, [`w = \dot{W}/\dot{m}_\text{steam}`]?
b. By how much does the answer change if you neglect the kinetic energy of the material leaving the turbine?


*Answers*:

a. [`w = `][_________]{$w} [`\text{kJ/kg}`]
b. [`w_\text{ignoring $ke$} - w_\text{including $ke$} = `][_________]{$dw} [`\text{kJ/kg}`]
