BEGIN_TEXT
Refrigerant-134a enters the evaporator coils placed at
the back of the freezer section of a household refrigerator at
\(120\) \(kPa\) with a quality of \(20% \) and leaves at \(120\) \(kPa\)
and \(-20^{\circ}C\). If the compressor consumes \($W\) \(W\) of power and
the COP of the refrigerator is \($COP\), determine: $BR
$SPACE 1. the power consumed by the refrigerator  $BR
$SPACE 2. the mass flow rate of the refrigerant $BR
$SPACE 3. the change in enthalpy of the refrigerant $BR
$SPACE 4. the rate of heat rejection $BR
