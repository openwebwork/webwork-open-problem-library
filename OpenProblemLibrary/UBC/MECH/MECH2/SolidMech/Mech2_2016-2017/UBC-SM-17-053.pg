BEGIN_TEXT

A student decides to build a boiler for a model steam engine. He cuts some thin sheet metal into a strip, rolls it into a spiral, and puts on end caps, as shown in the diagram. The diameter of the cylinder \(D = $D\) \(mm\) and wall thickness \(t = $t\) \(mm\). The student has some fancy glue, and uses it to secure the spiral seam. After applying the glue, he applies a torque \(T\) to clamp the edges of the seam shut. With the torque still applied, he puts some water inside, heats the boiler, and a steam pressure \(p = $p\) \(kPa\) is created. After a while, the student notices that the heat has caused the glue to melt and run out. However, even when the cylinder is pressurized, the torque \(T\) is still sufficient to keep the seam closed so that no water leaks out. Determine the angle theta degrees that requires the minimum torque \(T\) to keep the seam closed. (Hint: use Mohr's circle). Give the answer in degrees.
