SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Reflexivity means that
\(
  m - An = m - Bn
\)
for all integers \(m, n\).  That means \(A=B\).   Symmetry then means that
\(
  m - An = n - Bm = n - Am
\),
whence 
\(
  n(1-A) = m(1-A)
\)
for all integers \(m, n\); this happens precisely when \(A=1\).  Thus the
relation becomes
\(
 (m, n) \sim (u, v) \Longleftrightarrow m-n = u-v
\).
We readily check that this is transitive, and so it is an equivalence.
