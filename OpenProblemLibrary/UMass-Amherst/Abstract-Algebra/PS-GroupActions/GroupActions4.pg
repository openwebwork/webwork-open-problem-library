BEGIN_TEXT

In this problem we work out the number of essentially different ways 
(i.e. up to orientation preseving symmetries) to color the edges of
a tetrahedron using \($n\) colors.  The main tool is Burnside's theorem:  Let \(G\) be a finite group action on a finite set \(X\); then the number distinct \(G\)-orbits is

$BR
   \[ \frac{1}{\#G} \sum_{g\in G} \# \textrm{Fix}_G(g) \]
$BR
where \( \textrm{Fix}_G(g) \) is the set of elements \( x\in X \) such that \(g(x) = x \).   
In our case,  \(X\) is the set of all possible
colorings (i.e.~ignore the requirement about essentially different).  Thus

$BR
$BR

\(\# X  = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

$BR

Upon labelling the VERTICES of the tetrahedron as 1, 2, 3 and 4, we check that the group of  orientation preserving symmetries of a tetrahedron is isomorphic to the group \(A_4\), which has order 12.  It consists of one identity 
permutation, eight 3-cycles, and three elements which are 
  product of two disjoint 2-cycles.
$BR $BR

Having  determined \(X\) and \(G\), we now compute each of the terms in
Burnside's formula.  We begin with the identity element
\( g = () \).
In Burside's formula it gives rise to the term
\(
\# \textrm{Fix}_G( \,()\, ) 
\),
which is the number of colorings in \(X\) fixed by ().  Thus
$BR$BR

\(\# \textrm{Fix}_G( \,()\, ) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

Next, consider the 3-cycle \((ijk)\).   It cyclically permutes the three vertices \(i, j, k\) and fixes the remaining vertex \(l\).  The three edges connected to \(l\) must have the same color.  Each of the three remaining edges is connected to exactly one of \(i,j,k\)  and these edges must also have the same color. Thus $BR $BR

\(\# \textrm{Fix}_G( \,(ijk)\, ) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

The same reasoning shows that $BR $BR

\(\# \textrm{Fix}_G( \,(ij)(kl)\, ) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

Combine everything and recall \((\ast \ast)\), we see that the number of essentially distinct edge-colorings is $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\}
