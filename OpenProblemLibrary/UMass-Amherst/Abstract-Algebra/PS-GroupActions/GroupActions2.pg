BEGIN_TEXT

Let \(G\) be a finite group of order \($pk\) acting on a finite set \(S\) of size \($g\).  Suppose we know that there are 
\(
  < $twop
\)
distinct \(G\)-orbits.
We now work out step-by-step the possible values for the NUMBER of orbits of this \(G\)-action. $BR $BR

We begin with a general observation.  Let \(X\) be any non-empty set.
Since the size of \(G\) is the \($k\)-th power of the prime \($p\), by the orbit-stabilizer theorem the possible values for orbit sizes of a \(G\)-action on
\(X\) are $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

Next, we specialize to the case where \(G\) acts on our given set
\(S\) of size \($g\).  We can his further limits the possible values for the
orbit size to $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

And since distinct orbits are pairwise disjoint and their union is the set \(S\), if we denote by $BR $BR

\(A = \)number of size \($p^0\) orbits $BR
\(B = \)number of size \($p^1\) orbits $BR
\(C = \)number of size \($p^2\) orbits $BR $BR

then $BR $BR

\((\ast 1)\)  
   \( \)
   \( \)
   \( \)
\($g = A \times 1 + B \times $p + C \times $pp\) $BR $BR

Don't forget the initial hypothesis

$BR$BR

\((\ast 2)\)  
   \( \)
   \( \)
   \( \)
 there are 
\(
  < $twop
\)
distinct \(G\)-orbits.

$BR$BR

We are interested in the total number of distinct \(G\)-orbits, which is 
equal to 
\(
  A + B + C
\).
Since \($g < 2\times $p^2\), it follows from \( (\ast1) \) that   $BR $BR

\((\ast 3)\)
   \( \)
   \( \)
   \( \)
\(0 \le A \le $g\), \(0 \leq B \leq $p\), and \(0 \leq C \leq 1\). $BR $BR



To finish the problem we can now proceed by brute force, taking each possible
triple of \(A, B, C\) given by \((\ast 3)\) and see if it satisfies
 \( (\ast 2) \).
Here is a more systematic approach. $BR $BR

First, if \(C=1\) then \( (\ast) \) becomes

$BR$BR

\(1 = A\times 1 + B\times 5.\)

$BR$BR

We are still subject to condition \( (\ast 3) \), so 

$BR$BR
\( \)
\( \)
\( \)
If \(C=1\) 
then
\(A\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
and
\(B\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$BR$BR


For the rest of this argument we take \(C=0\), in which case \((\ast 1)\)
and
\( (\ast 2) \)
become $BR $BR


\( \)
\( \)
\( \)
 \($g = A + B \times $p\). $BR 

\( \)
\( \)
\( \)
 \(10 > A + B.\)

 $BR 
 $BR

Consequently,

$BR$BR
\( \)
\( \)
\( \)
If \(C=0\) 
then
\(A\) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
and
\(B\) = \{ans_rule(10)\}

\(0 \le A \le $g\), \(0 \leq B \leq $p\), and \(0 \leq C \leq 1\). $BR $BR

To finish the problem we can now proceed by brute force, trying out all possible choices of \(A, B, C\) under \((\ast 2)\) and see which triples work. Here is a more systematic approach: $BR $BR

Reduce both sides modulo \($p\) and we see that $BR $BR

\((\ast 6)\)  \(A = 1 + k * $p\) for some integer \(k\). $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

(NOTE:  this implies in particular that \(k \leq $p\), and so \(A \leq $g\), which is compatible with the upper bound in \((\ast 3)\)) $BR $BR

By hypothesis there are \(< 11\) distinct orbits.  Recall \((\ast 2)\) (and that \(C=0\)) and
we get a lower bound of \(B\) in terms of \($p\) only: $BR $BR

\(B \geq\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

Don't forget that \((\ast 3)\) also gives an upper bound of \(B\).  Combine everything and we see that the number
