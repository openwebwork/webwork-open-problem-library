SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The natural action of \(G\) = Sym(Tetrahedron) on the four faces gives rise to an
isomorphism of \(G\) with \(A_4\).  Under this identification,
if \(g\) is a non-trivial element of \(A_4\) then we check that
  \(\operatorname{Fix}_G(g)\)
is the empty set.  So by Burnside's theorem, the number of essentially
different coloring in question is equal to

 (1/12) * (number of different coloring of the four faces using at most $n colors)
