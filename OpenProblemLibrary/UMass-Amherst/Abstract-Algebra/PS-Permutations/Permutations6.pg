Let \( f \) be a permutation on the set \( $LB $xList $RB \), defined as follows $BR $BR

\[ f = $fCycle1string $fCycle2string \] $BR

(a) Write the permutation \( f^{$n} \) as a product of disjoint cycles, separated by commas (e.g. \( ( 1, 2 ), ( 3, 4, 5 ), \ldots \) ). $BR
Do not include 1-cycles (e.g. \( (2) \) ) in your answer. $BR $BR
\( f^{$n} = \) \{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $BR $BR

(b) Determine the order of \( f^{$n} \). \{ ans_rule( 10 ) \} $BR $BR
