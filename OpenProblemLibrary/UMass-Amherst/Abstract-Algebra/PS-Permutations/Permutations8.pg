Let \( f \) be a permutation on the set \( $LB $xList $RB \), defined as follows $BR $BR

\[ f = $fCycle1string $fCycle2string \] $BR

(a) Write \( f \) as a product of transpositions (not necessarily disjoint), separated by commas (e.g. \( ( 1, 2 ), ( 2, 3 ), \ldots \) ). $BR $BR

\( f = \) \{ ans_rule( 50 ) \} $PAR

(b) Write \( f^{-1} \) as a product of transpositions in the same way. $PAR

\( f^{-1} = \) \{ ans_rule( 50 ) \} $PAR

Assume multiplication of permutations f,g obeys the rule (fg)(x) = f(g(x)) so \((1,3)(1,2)=(1,2,3)\) not \((1,3,2)\).
