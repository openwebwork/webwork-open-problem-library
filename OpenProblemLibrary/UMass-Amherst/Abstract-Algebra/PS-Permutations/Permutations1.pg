TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));

Let \( f \) and \( g \) be permutations on the set \( $LB $xList $RB \), defined as follows $BR $BR

\[ f = \{ display_matrix_mm( $fMatrix, left => '(', right => ')' )  \} \] $BR
\[ g = \{ display_matrix_mm( $gMatrix, left => '(', right => ')' )  \} \] $BR

Write each of the following permutations as a product of disjoint cycles, separated by commas (e.g. \( ( 1, 2 ), ( 3, 4, 5 ), \ldots \) ). $BR
Do not include 1-cycles (e.g. \( (2) \) ) in your answer. $BR $BR

(a) \( fg = \) \{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $BR $BR

(b) \( f^{-1} = \) \{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $BR $BR

(c) \( fgf^{-1} = \) \{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $PAR

Assume multiplication of permutations f,g obeys the rule (fg)(x) = f(g(x)) so \((1,3)(1,2)=(1,2,3)\) not \((1,3,2)\).
