 $PAR SOLUTION $PAR

Both the domain and range of \(\varphi\) are finite sets of size \($b\).  The number of functions between two sets of size \($b\) is \($b^{$b}\), and the number of such functions which are injective -- and hence bijective since the domain and range have the same size -- is \($b!\). Thus the number of non-bijective \(\varphi\) is \($b^{$b} - $b! = $h\).
