(i)  Since \(\varphi\) is one-to-one, the additional condition \(\varphi ($f) = $g \) means that there are \( $bb! \) choices for the remaining \( $bb \) slots.

(ii)
Since \(\varphi\) is one-to-one, the additional condition \(\varphi ($f) \neq $g \) means that there are \( $bb \) choices for \( \varphi($f) \) and \( $bb ! \) choices for the remaining slots, so all together there are \( $bb \times $bb! \) choices for \( \varphi \).
