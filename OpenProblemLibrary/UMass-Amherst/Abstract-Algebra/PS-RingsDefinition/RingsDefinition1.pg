For any set \( X \), denote by \( P^X \) the set of all subsets of \( X \) (including the empty set \( \emptyset \) and \( X \) itself). This is called the power set of \( X \). $PAR

If \( A, B \) are elements of \( P^X \), define $PAR
\[ A + B := ( A - B ) \cup ( B - A ) \] $BR
\[ A \times B := A \cap B \] $PAR

FACT:  \( P^X \) together with these two operations forms a commutative ring with a multiplicative identity. $PAR

For the rest of this exercise, take \( X \) to be the set \( $LB $xList $RB \). $BR $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$SOLUTION $BR

(a) Recall the definition of the multiplication operation on \( P^X \) and we see that to say that a subset \( E \) of \( X \) is a multiplicative identity of \( P^X \) is to say that

\[ (*) \; E \cap B = B = B \cap E \]

for every subset \( B \) of \( X \). By basic properties of sets, the second condition is equivalent to the first one, so it suffices to focus on that.  Now, \( E \cap B \) consists of all elements of \( X \) that belong to both \( E \) and \( B \).  So  \( E \cap B = B \) means that every element of \( X \) that belongs to \( B \) must also belong to \( E \); that happens if and only if \( B \) is contained in \( E \).   Since \( (*) \) holds for every subset \( B \) of \( X \),  that means \( E \) must contain every subset of \( X \), and so \( E = X \). $PAR

(b) Just like part (a), to say that a subset \( Z \) of \( P^X \) is an additive identity 
of \( P^X \) is to say that

\[ (**) \; ( Z - B ) \cup ( B - Z ) = B \]

for every subset \( B \) of \( X \).  Note that if \( B \) and \( Z \) have a common element \( x \) then \( x \) is not contained in the left side of \( (**) \) (draw a Venn diagram if this is not clear).  Thus we need \( Z \) to be disjoint from \( B \) for every subset \( B \) of \( X \).  This happens precisely when \( Z \) is the empty set. $PAR

(c) To say that a non-zero element \( A \) of \( P^X \) -- i.e. a subset of \( X \) -- is a zero-divisor is to say that we can find another subset \( B \) of \( X \) such that \( A \times B \) is equal to the zero element (additive identity) of this ring, and \( B \) is not equal to the zero element. By part (b), this means \( A \cap B = \emptyset \). This happens if and only if \( A \) and \( B \) are disjoint. Furthermore, we need \( B \neq \emptyset \), so \( A \) cannot be the whole set \( X \).
Thus the nonzero zero-divisors of \(P^X\) are precisely the non-empty proper subsets of
\(X\).
 $PAR


(d) To say that an element \( A \) of \( P^X \) -- i.e. a subset of \( X \) -- is a 
multiplicative unit is to say that we can find another subset \( B \) of \( X \) such that \( A \times B \) is equal to the multiplicative identity of \( X \). By part (a), this means \( A \cap B = X \). This happens if and only if \( A = B = X \).
