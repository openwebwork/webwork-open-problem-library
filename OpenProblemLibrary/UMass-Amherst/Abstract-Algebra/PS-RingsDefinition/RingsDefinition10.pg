TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));

Find all integers \( n \) in the set \( $LB $rangeList $RB \) such that the ring \( \{ cyclic( n ) \} \) satisifies 
the following properties: $BR $BR

(a) \( ( xy = 0 ) \Rightarrow ( x = 0 \textrm{ or } y = 0 ) \) $BR
\{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $BR $BR

(b) \( ( xy = xz \textrm{ and } x \neq 0 ) \Rightarrow ( y = z ) \) $BR
\{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $BR $BR

(c) \( ( x^2 = x ) \Rightarrow ( x = 0 \textrm{ or } x = 1 ) \) $BR
\{ ans_rule( 20 ) \} $BR $BR

Reminder:  In the ring \( \{ cyclic( n ) \} \),  \( 0 \) means \( 0 \pmod{ n } \), and equality means 
congruent modulo \( n \).

$BR

Hint for (c):  The Chinese reminder theorem could be useful here.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$SOLUTION

This problem can be done by brute force search. Alternatively: $BR $BR

(a) This is equivalent to saying that \( \{ cyclic( n ) \} \) has no zero-divisors.  This happens if and only if \( n \) is a prime. $PAR

(b) Rewrite \( xy = xz \) as \( x( y - z ) = 0 \pmod{ n } \) and we see that this reduces to (a). $PAR

(c)  To say that \( x^2 = x \) has a solution in \( \{ cyclic( n ) \} \)
is to say that there exists an integer \( x \) such that
\(
  x(x-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}
\).
If \(n\) is prime, then we must have
\(
  x\equiv 0, 1\pmod{n}
\).

$BR

Now, suppose \(n = n_1 n_2\) where \( n_1, n_2 > 1\) are coprime.  Then
for each \(i\), the equation
\(
  x(x-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{n_i}
\)
has at least two solutions, namely
\(
  x\equiv 0, 1\pmod{n_i}
\).
By the Chinese reminder theorem,
\(
  x(x-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}
\)
would have at least four solutions; in particular, there are solutions
beside 
\(  x\equiv 0, 1\pmod{n}. \)

$BR$BR




Note:  The discussion for (c) above exludes the case where \(n =p^r\)
with \(p\) prime and \(r>1\).  To handle this remaining case requires
further study of properties of integers modulo higher powers of a prime.


END_SOLUTION

COMMENT( "(i) Complete solution included.  (ii) The randomized modulus of this problem will never be p^r for some prime p and r>1, so part (c) can be solved using the Chinese remainder theorem alone." );
