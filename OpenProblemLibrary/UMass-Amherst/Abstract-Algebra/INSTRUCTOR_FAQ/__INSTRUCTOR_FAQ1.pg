These problems have some special options: $BR $BR

- You can change how finite cyclic groups (e.g. \( \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \) ) are displayed. By default, these display as \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), but you can change them to display as \( \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \) or \( C_5 \) by making a copy of algebraMacros.pl in the course directory, and changing which line is uncommented in the cyclic( ) subroutine. $BR $BR

- Similarly, you can change how dihedral groups are displayed using the same method. Some authors write \( D_n \) to represent the dihedral group of order \( n \); other authors use \( D_n \) to mean the dihedral group of order \( 2n \). You can choose whichever one you want in your copy of algebraMacros.pl. $BR

- Finally, you can change how the quaternion group is displayed using the same 
method. Some authors write \( Q_8 \); other authors use \( \mathbb{H} \).
