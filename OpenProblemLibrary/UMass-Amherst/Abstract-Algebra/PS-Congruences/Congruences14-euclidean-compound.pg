$BITALIC

In this problem we work out step-by-step the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Specifically, we will find two integers \( x, y \) so that $BR $BR

\[ $a x + $b y = \gcd( $a, $b ). \] $BR

To do this we first apply the Euclidean Algorithm to compute \( \gcd( $a, $b ) \), and then unwind the calculation to find \( x \) and \( y \).  $EITALIC $BR $HR $BR

	By unwinding the second equation from the Euclidean algorithm

		\[ $a = $b \times $q1 + $r1 \] $BR

		\[ $b = $r1 \times $q2 + $r2 \]

	we find that $BR $BR

	\[ \gcd( $a, $b ) = $r2 = $b + $r1 \times ( - $q2 ) . \quad (*) \] $BR

	Note that \( $r1 \) appears in the first equation. So let's solve for \( $r1 \) and substitute that into \( (*) \). $BR $BR

	From the first equation, $BR $BR
	
	\( $r1 = $a \times \) \{ NAMED_ANS_RULE( 'r1eq1', 5 ) \} \( + $b \times \) \{ NAMED_ANS_RULE( 'r1eq2', 5 ) \} . $BR $BR

	This completes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm in this case. In general it could take several steps to find the gcd, in which case you would need to unwind them in reversed order to find \( x \) and \( y \).
