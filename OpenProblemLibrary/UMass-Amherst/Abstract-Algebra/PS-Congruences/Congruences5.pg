#  modulus.  In the first problem the multiple is prime to the modulus, and

Solve each of the following congruences. Make sure that the number you 
enter is in the range 
\(
  [0, M-1]
\)
where \(M\) is the modulus of the congruence.
If there is more than one solution, enter the answer as a list separated by 
commas. If there is no answer, enter N.
