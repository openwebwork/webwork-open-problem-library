SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

We want to count the number of homomorphisms
\( f: \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \rightarrow \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \)
whose image has prescribed size.
For any homomorphism between finite groups, the order of the image
must divide the order of the codomain (target group) by Lagrange's
theorem, and must divide the order of the domain by the Fundamental
homomorphism theorem (i.e., the first isomorphism theorem).  In the
third and fourth cases, one of these conditions is violated, so there
are no such homomorphisms.

$PAR

If the order of the image \(d\) is a common divisor of \($m\)
and \($n\), then we need the order of 
\( 
f(1) \in \{ cyclic( $n ) \}
\) 
to be exactly \(d\).  For each element of \(\{ cyclic($n)\}\) of
order \(d\), there will be such a homomorphism, and the value of
\(f(1)\) determines the homomorphism because \(1\) generates
\(\{ cyclic( $m )\}\).

$PAR

So, when \(d\) divides \($n\), we must count the number of elements
of order \(d\).  Such an element must lie in a subgroup
of order \(d\), and
a cyclic group of order \($n\) has a unique subgroup
for each \(d\) dividing \($n\) (which must itself be cyclic).  

$PAR

This reduces us to counting the number of elements of order \(d\)
in a cyclic group of order \(d\), which is \(\varphi(d)\).  So, the
final answers are \(\varphi($q) = $q-1\), \(\varphi($pq) = ($p-1)($q-1)\),
\(0\), \(0\), and \(\varphi($p) = $p-1\).
