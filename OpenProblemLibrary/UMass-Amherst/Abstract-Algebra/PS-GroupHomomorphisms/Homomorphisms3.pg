BEGIN_TEXT

The dihedral group \( \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \) is generated by an element \(a\) of order \($n\), and an element \(b\) of order 2, satisfying the relation $BR $BR

\((\ast)\)    \( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)     \(ba = a^{$n-1}b\) $BR $BR

(i) Determine number of group homomorphisms  \(f: \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \rightarrow {\mathbb{Z}} \). $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

(ii) Determine the number of group homomorphisms \(g: \{ dihedral( $m ) \} \rightarrow {\mathbb{Q}}^\times\) $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

Hint:
$BR
What can you can about the order of \(f(x)\) vs. the order of \(x\)? 
$BR
What can you say about the order of elements of \(\mathbb{Z}\) and of \( \mathbb{Q}^\times \)?  
$BR
And for (ii): you might want to make use of the relation \((\ast)\).

    $PAR SOLUTION $PAR
      (i)  Every non-identity element of \(\mathbb{Z}\) has infinite order, whereas every element of \( \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \) has finite order.  Homomorphisms take elements of finite order to elements of finite order, so any homomorphism from \( \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \) to \(\mathbb{Z}\) must be trivial. $BR $BR

      (ii) \( \mathbb{Q}^\times \) has exactly 2 elements of finite order, namely \(\pm 1\).  Either one could be the value of \(g(b)\).  And since \(a\) in \( \{ dihedral( $m ) \} \) has order \($m\) and  \($m\) is even,  \(g(a)\) can be \(\pm 1\), and either choice is compatible with any choice of \(g(b)\) with respect to the relation \(ba = a^{$m-1}b\)  (check!).  So there are 4 choices of \(g\).
