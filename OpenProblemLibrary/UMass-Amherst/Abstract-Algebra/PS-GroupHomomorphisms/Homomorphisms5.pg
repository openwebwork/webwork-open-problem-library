BEGIN_TEXT

In this problem we determine the number of group homomorphisms $BR $BR

   \(f:  \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \rightarrow \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \) $BR $BR

such that the image of \( f\) has size exactly \($p\). $BR $BR

First, since  \($m \equiv 0\) \(\pmod{$m}\), we have $BR $BR

\[  \begin{array}{llllllll}
  0 & \equiv & f(0)
      &&
      \text{property  of  homomorphisms}
  \\
    & \equiv & f($m) 
  \\
    & \equiv & $m f(1) \pmod{$n}
      &&
      \text{property  of  homomorphisms.}
   \end{array}  \]
$BR
On the other hand, \(f(1)\) is an element of \( \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \) so
  \(0 \equiv $n f(1) \pmod{$n} \). $BR $BR

Thus $BR
\( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)     \(\gcd($m,$n) f(1) \equiv 0 \) \(\pmod{$n}\) $BR
i.e. $BR
\( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)     \( $pq f(1) \equiv 0 \) \(\pmod{$n}\) $BR
whence $BR
\( (\ast)\) \( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)     \(f(1) = $q u \)  for some \(u\) in \( \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \). $BR $BR

On the other hand, the image of \(f\) is a subgroup of the cyclic group \( \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \). But a cyclic group has at most ONE subgroup of any given order, so if the image of \(f\) has size \($p\) then the elements of the image of
\( f\)  must be \{ans_rule(20)\} (please enter your answer as an ORDERED list) $BR $BR

Combine this with \((\ast)\) and we see that in order for the image of \( f\)
 to have size \($p\),
the choices for \(f(1)\) are \{ans_rule(20)\} (please enter your answer as an ORDERED list) $BR $BR

Consequently, the number of such functions \(f\) is \{ans_rule(10)\}. Please enter your answer as a number.
