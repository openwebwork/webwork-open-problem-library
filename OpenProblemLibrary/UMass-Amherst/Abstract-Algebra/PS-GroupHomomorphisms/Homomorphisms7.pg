SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR


The second part asks us to  count the number of homomorphisms
\(
  f: \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \longrightarrow \{ cyclic( $n ) \}
\)
whose image has size \($p\). That means the order of 
\( 
f(1) \in \{ cyclic( $n ) \}
\) 
must be exactly \($p\).  It follows that \( f(1)\) is of the form
\(
  $p^2 m
\)
where \(0\le m< $p\) and  \((m, $p)=1\).  The number of such elements is 
\( \varphi($p) = $p-1 \).
The same argument shows that the number of homomorphisms
\(
  f: \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \longrightarrow \{ cyclic( $n ) \}
\)
whose image has size \($pp\) and \($ppp\) are, respectively,
 \( \varphi($pp)  = $pp-$p\)
and
 \( \varphi($ppp)= $ppp-$pp\).

$BR
In the first and third part,  the order of \(f(1)\) must be divisible
by \($q\).  But that is impossible since
\(
  f(1)\in \{ cyclic( $n ) \}
\)
and \($q\) does not divide \($n\).  So there is no such homomorphism
in the first and third part.

$BR
Finally, in the last part \(f(1)\) must have order \($ppp\)$, which means
the order of 
\( 
1 \in \{ cyclic( $m ) \}
\) 
must be divisible by \($ppp\).  But \($ppp\) does not divide \($m\), so there
is not such homomorphism.
