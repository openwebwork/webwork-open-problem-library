BEGIN_TEXT

In this problem we work out step-by-step the number of group homomorphisms from a dihedral group to a finite cyclic group. Recall that the dihedral group \( \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \) is generated by an element \(a\)  of order \($n\), and an element \(b\) of order 2, satisfying the relation $BR $BR

\((\ast)\)   \( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)   \( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)      \(ba = a^{$n-1}b\) $BR $BR

Let \(f: \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \rightarrow \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \)  be a group homomorphism. $BR $BR

Since \(a^{$n} = e\), properties of homomorphisms then imply that $BR $BR

\($n f(a) \equiv f(a^{$n}) \) (remember that \( \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) is an additive group) $BR
\(\phantom{$n f(a)} \equiv f(e) \) $BR
\(\phantom{$n f(a)} \equiv 0 \pmod{$m} \) $BR $BR


That means the possible choices for \(f(a)\) are \{ans_rule(20)\} (please answer here as a comma-separated list of integers \(\ge 0\) and \(<$m\)). $BR $BR

Similarly, from \(b^2 = e\) we see that the possible choices for \(f(b)\) are \{ans_rule(20)\} (please answer here as a comma-separated list). $BR $BR

But there is an additional restriction: the group elements \(a, b\) in \( \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \) satisfy the  relation \(ba = a^{$n-1}b\). Apply the group homomorphism \(f\) and use the fact that \( \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) is Abelian, we see that this implies \( ($n - 2) f(a)=0\). All together, we see that the number of group homomorphisms \(f: \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \rightarrow \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) is \{ans_rule(20)\}.
