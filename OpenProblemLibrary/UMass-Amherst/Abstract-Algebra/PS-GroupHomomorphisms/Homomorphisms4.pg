BEGIN_TEXT

The dihedral group \( \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \) is generated by an element \(a\) of order \($n\), and an element \(b\) of order 2, satisfying the relation $BR $BR

\((\ast)\)    \( \) \( \) \( \) \( \)     \(ba = a^{$n-1}b\) $BR $BR

(i) Determine number of group homomorphisms  \(f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \{ dihedral( $n ) \} \). $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

(ii) Determine the number of group homomorphisms \(g: \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \rightarrow \{ dihedral( $m ) \} \) $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

Hint: What can you can about the order of \(f(x)\) where \(x\) is an element of \(G\)? Also, for (ii) you might want to make use of the relation \((\ast)\).

    $PAR SOLUTION $PAR

(i)  Let \(G\) be a multiplicative group.  
For any element  \(g\in G\), we readily check that
\(
f(n) = g^n
\)
defines a group homomorphism from \(\mathbb{Z}\) to \(G\).  In particular,
there are \(\#G\) such homomorphisms. 



<br>

  (ii)
  Since \( \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) is cyclic of order \($m\), any homomorphism from \( \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) is determined 
  by its value at the generator \(1\) subject to the condition 
    \(e = g($m\times 1) = g(1)^{$m}\)
  (note that we write \($m \times 1\) since \( \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) is  an additive group, and we write \(g(1)^{$m}\)
  since  \( \{ dihedral( $m ) \} \) is a multiplicative group).
  Recall the order of elements of \( \{ dihedral( $m ) \} \) and we see that any one of the rotations
  \(a^i\) can serve as \(g(1)\).  And since \( 1 \in  \{ cyclic( $m ) \} \) has even order, the reflections \((a^j b)\) can serve as \(g(1)\)  as well.  Thus the number
of \(g\) is \($a\).
