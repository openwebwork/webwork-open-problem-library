SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Since \( \{ dihedral( n ) \} \) is generated by \(a\) and \(b\) and satisfies \(ba = a^{n-1}b\), a homomorphism from \( \{ dihedral( n ) \} \) to any group is determined by its values at \(a\) and at \(b\) provided that $BR
  \(f(a^n)=0\), $BR
  \(f(b^2)=0\), and $BR
  \(f(ba) = f(a^{n-1}b)\). $BR
Using properties of homomorphisms, this becomes $BR
(*1)   \(n f(a) = 0\),  $BR                
(*2)   \(2 f(b) = 0\), and $BR
(*3)   \(f(b) + f(a) = (n-1)f(a) + f(b)\) $BR
And since \( \{ cyclic( n ) \} \) is Abelian, this last condition plus (*1) means that $BR
(*3')  \(2 f(a) = 0\). $BR
Combine this with (*1) and we get $BR
(*4)   \(\gcd(2, n) f(a) = 0\). $BR $BR

In part (i) we have \(f(b) = 0\), which satisfies (*2),  So if \(n\) is odd then \(f(a)=0\), whence \(f\) is the trivial homomorphism, whereas if \(n\) is even then \(f(a)\) could be \(0\) or \(n/2\), so there are two choices of \(f\). $BR $BR

Turning to part (ii), we see that if \(f(b)\) is not zero then it must be \(n/2\). And if this is true, then there are again two choices for \(f(a)\), namely \(0\) and \(n/2\).  Thus if \(f(b)\) is not zero, then the number of homomorphisms is either \(0\) or \(4\), depending on whether \(f(b)=n/2\) or not.
