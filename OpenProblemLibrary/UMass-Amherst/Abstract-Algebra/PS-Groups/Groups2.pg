For each of the following operations on the set of all real numbers (including the negative ones), determine if it satisfies each of the following conditions (enter the number \(1\) if the condition is satisfied, and enter the number \(0\) if it is not).
Note:  If there is no identity, enter "0" for inverse.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR


First, consider the operation
\( x\ast y = |x+y| \).
Note that
\(
  ( (-1)\ast (-2) ) \ast 4 
  =
  | |-1-2| + 4 |
  = 7
\)
and
\(
  (-1) \ast ( (-2)\ast 4) 
  =
  | (-1) + |-2+4| | 
  =
  | -1 + 2 | = 1
\),
so this operation is not association.  Next,
\(
 x \ast y
 =
 |x+y|
 =
 |y+x|
 =
 y\ast x
\),
so it is associative.
Note that 
\(
  x \ast y
\)
is always non-negative for all \( x, y \) but \( x\) could be negative, so
there is no identity for this operation, and because of that, inverse does not
exist.


Next, consider the operation
\(
  x\ast y = xy + $a
\).
Since
\(
  x\ast (y\ast z) = x(yz+$a) + $a = xyz + $a x + $a
\)
and
\(
  (x\ast y)\ast z = (xy + $a)z + $a = xyz + $a z + $a
\),
it means that
\(
  x\ast (y\ast z) \not= (x\ast y)\ast z 
\)
if \( x\not z\).  In particular, this operation is not associative.
Next, 
\(
  x\ast y = xy + $a = yx + $a = y\ast x
\),
so it is associativity.  In order for \(\ast\) to have an identity, we
need to find a real number \(y\) such that
\(
  xy + $a = x
\)
for all real numbers.  This is not possible, and so there is no
identity element for \(\ast\), whence there is no inverse as well.


Finally, consider the operation
\(
  x\ast y = x+y+$b
\).
We have
\(
  (x\ast y)\ast z  =  (x+y+$b) + z + $b = x+y+z+2$b
\)
and
\(
  x(y\ast z)  =  x+ (y+z+$b) + $b = x+y+z+2$b
\)
so it is associative, and
\(
  x\ast y = x+y+$b = y+x+$b = y\ast x
\)
so it is commutative.  The equation
\(
  x\ast y = x
\)
is equivalent to 
\(
  x+y+$b = x
\);
it has solution \(y=-$b\) which is independent of \(x\), so \(-$b\) is an
identity. Finally, for any \(x\), the equation
\(
 x\ast y = -$b
\)
has a solution \( y = -x-2$b\), so this operation has an inverse.  This
completes the solution of the problem.


Remark:  The argument for the first operation illustrates a good principle:
  We can disprove a
statement (e.g.~associativity) by giving examples, but to prove a statement
(e.g.~commutativity) we need to examine the general case.
Note also that sometimes it is just as easy (if not easier) to
 disprove a statement by looking at the general case, as is
illustrated by the argument for the second operation.
