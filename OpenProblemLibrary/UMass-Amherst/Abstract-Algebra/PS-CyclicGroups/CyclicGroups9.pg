Let \(x\) be an element of order \($n\) in a group G (not necessarily cyclic, finite, or Abelian). How many distinct subgroups of G are contained in \(\langle x \rangle\)? $BR $BR

BEGIN_HINT 
Every group has at least two subgroups, and \($n\) is a product of \($r\) 
primes!

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR


Regardless of the group theoretic properties of \(G\),
the subgroup
\(
  \langle x \rangle
\)
is a cyclic group of order \($n\), and as such 
\(
  \langle x \rangle
\)
has as many subgroups as there are divisors of \($n\).  Since \($n\) is
the product of \($r\) distinct primes, \($n\) has \($a\) distinct divisors,
and so 
\(
  \langle x \rangle
\)
has \($a\) distinct subgroups.
