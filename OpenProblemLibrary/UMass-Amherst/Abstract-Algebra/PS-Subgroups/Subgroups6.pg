# groups are represented internally using integers 0, 1, ..., n where 0 is the identity and n is the order of the group. This simplifies programming.

# externally, the student sees the group elements as e, x1, x2, ..., xn

# NON-IDENTITY elements of the group
@elements = ( 1 .. 11 );


# list of possible groups, defined by multiplication tables. There are five groups of order 12
