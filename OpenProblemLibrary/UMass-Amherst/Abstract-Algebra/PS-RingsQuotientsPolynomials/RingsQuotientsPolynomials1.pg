SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$SOLUTION

The quotient of a commutative ring with identity by an ideal \( J \) is a field if and only if \( J \) is a maximal ideal.  Now, \( \{ cyclic( $modulus ) \} [x] \) is the ring of one-variable polynomials over the finite field \( \{ cyclic( $modulus ) \} \), which is  a PID, so the principal ideal generated by an element is maximal if and only if this element is irreducible.  So to solve this problem we need to run through all elements \( b \in \{ cyclic( $modulus ) \} \) and find the values for which \( $f \) is irreducible.
