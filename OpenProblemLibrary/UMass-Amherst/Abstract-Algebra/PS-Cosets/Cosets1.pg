BEGIN_TEXT

In this problem we work out step-by-step a complete set of left
coset representatives of a subgroup. First, let us recall how to do this in general.  Say you have a subgroup \(H\) of \(G\). Remember that for any subgroup \(H\) of a general group \(G\), $BR $BR

\((\ast)\) \(xH = yH\)      if and only if     \(x^{-1} y\) is in \(H\). $BR $BR

In particular, $BR $BR

\((\ast \ast)\) the identity \(e\) is a coset representative of the trivial coset \(H\). $BR $BR

To find representatives for all left \(H\)-cosets we proceed <i>inductively</i>. Say we have already found representatives for a collection of \(H\)-cosets. Denote by \(S\) the union of the \(H\)-cosets for which we have already found representatives. $BR $BR

  (i) If \(S = G\) then we are done; if not, $BR
  (ii) pick an element \(x\) of \(G\) not in \(S\) $BR
  (iii) add to \(S\) the elements of \(xH\), and then go back to step (i). $BR $BR

Let us now apply this to the subgroup \(\langle $b \rangle\) of \(U(56)\).  To simplify the notation, we represent each congruence class by a positive integer \(< 56\). $BR $BR

First, write down the elements of \(\langle $b \rangle\): $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(20)\} $BR $BR

Now we look for coset representatives.  For the trivial \(\langle $b \rangle\)-coset, condition \((\ast \ast\)) says that $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} is a coset represenatative for \(\langle $b \rangle\) in \(U(56)\). $BR $BR

We now apply the inductive algorithm above.   The subgroup \(\langle $b \rangle\) is a proper subgroup, so there are elements in \(U(56)\) not in \(\langle $b \rangle\).  By the algorithm above, we need to look for \(x\) in \(U(56)\) not in \(\langle $b \rangle\).  For a general group we just pick a random such element; in the case of \(U(56)\) we can be more specific, by picking the <i>smallest positive integer</i> \(x\) that represents a congruence class in \(U(56) - \langle $b \rangle\).  For the subgroup
\(\langle $b \rangle \) this integer \(x\) is $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR $BR

We check that \(S = \langle $b \rangle \cup x \langle $b \rangle \) together still do not fill up \(U(56)\); to find the next  coset representative we pick the smallest \(y\) in \(U(n) - S\). Repeat this process until we fill up \(S\) as described in the algorithm above.  In the end, this process the following list of coset representative: $BR $BR

\{ans_rule(20)\}
