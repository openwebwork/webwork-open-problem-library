SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

The subgroup \( \left< $a \right> \) of \( \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \) is also generated by \( \left< \gcd($a,$n) \right> \) and has index $BR $BR

\[ \frac{$n}{\gcd( $a, $n )} = \{ $n / gcd( $a, $n ) \} \] $BR

Thus \( \left< $a \right> \) has exactly \{ $n / $g1 \} distinct coset representatives. On the other hand, the difference of any two integers \( \geq 0 \) and \( < $g1 \) is not zero modulo \( $n \), which means any two such integers represent distinct cosets of \( \left< $a \right> \) in \( \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \). Combine the two and it follows that the integers \( \geq 0 \) and \( < $g1 \) form a complete set of coset representatives of \( \left< $a \right> \) in \( \{ cyclic( $n ) \} \).
