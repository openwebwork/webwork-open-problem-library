BEGIN_TEXT

In this problem we work out step-by-step a complete set of left
coset representatives of the subgroup \($n \mathbb{Z}\) of \(\mathbb{Z}\). First, let's recall the definition of coset representatives. $BR $BR

Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\).  Then a list of elements $BR $BR

\(g_1, g_2,...\) $BR $BR

is called a complete set of left-coset representatives of \(H\) in \(G\) if $BR
\( \)\( \)  a) for every element \(g\) in \(H\) there exists some \(g_i\) such that  \(gH = g_i H\) $BR
\( \)\( \)  b) if \(i \neq j\) then \(g_i H \neq g_j H\). $BR $BR

Now, take \(G = \mathbb{Z}\) and \(H = $n \mathbb{Z}\). Since \(G\) is an additive group, for any two elements \(x, y\) in \(G\), the coset of \(x\) and the coset of \(y\) are the same if and only if $BR $BR

\{ $radio->buttons() \} $BR $BR

\{ $mc -> print_q() \}
$BR
\{ $mc -> print_a() \}

Finally, write down a complete set of left representatives of \($n \mathbb{Z}\) in \(\mathbb{Z}\). Make sure that each representative is a non-negative integers \(< $n\). $BR
Enter your answer as a comma separated list. $BR $BR
