BEGIN_HINT
A commutative ring with multiplicative identity is a field if and only if every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. To solve this problem, express in terms of \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices what it means for an element of \( A( $d ) \) to have an inverse. This leads to a system of 4 equations, one for each entry of the \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices. Now, try to determine when this system has a unique solution.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$SOLUTION $BR

A commutative ring with multiplicative identity is a field if and only if every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, in which case the inverse must be unique. A non-zero element in \( A( $d ) \) is given by \( sI + tD \) where at least one of \( s, t \) is non-zero. To see if it has a multiplicative inverse, we try to solve the matrix equation $BR $BR

\[ (*)\quad  I = ( sI + tD ) ( uI + wD ). \] $BR

Expand the right side and we get $BR $BR

\[ I = ( su )I + ( sw + tu )D + ( tw )D^2. \] $BR

But \( D^2 \) is the diagonal matrix with \( $d \) on the diagonals, so this simplifies to $BR $BR

\[ I = ( su + $d tw )I + ( sw + tu )D. \] $BR

Of course the matrix \( D \) cannot be a scalar multiple of \( I \), so that means $BR $BR

\[ \begin{aligned}
	su +& $d tw &= 1 \\
	sw +& tu  &= 0
\end{aligned} \] $BR

Note that we can view this as a system of linear equations in the variables \( u, w \), in which case we can rewrite this using matrix notation as $BR $BR

\{ mbox( [
	'\( (**)\quad \)',
	display_matrix( [ [ '\( s \)', '\( t $d \)' ], [ '\( t \)', '\( s \)' ] ] ),
	display_matrix( [ [ '\( u \)' ], [ '\( w \)' ] ] ),
	'\( = \)',
	display_matrix( [ [ '\( 1 \)' ], [ '\( 0 \)' ] ] )
] ) \}

By general facts from linear algebra, we know that this system has a unique solution if and only if the determinant of the matrix above is not zero, i.e. if and only if \( s^2 - $d t^2 \neq 0 \), or equivalently, \( $d \neq ( s/t )^2 \) for some rational numbers \( s, t \). $BR $BR

Since \( $d = \{ sqrt( $d ) \} ^2 \), the system does not have a unique solution and so \( A( $d ) \) is not a field. The zero-divisors are described by the following analog of \( (*) \): $BR $BR

\[ 0 = ( sI + tD ) ( uI + wD ). \] $BR

Expand this matrix equation as before and we end up with the matrix equation $BR $BR

\{ mbox( [ display_matrix( [ [ '\( s \)', '\( t $d \)' ], [ '\( t \)', '\( s \)' ] ] ), display_matrix( [ [ '\( u \)' ], [ '\( w \)' ] ] ), '\( = \)', display_matrix( [ [ '\( 0 \)' ], [ '\( 0 \)' ] ] ) ] ) \}

Setting for example \( s = t = 1 \), we find that one solution is \( w = 1, u = ( \sqrt{$d} + 1 )/2 \). $BR $BR

Suppose we were dealing with \( A( d ) \) where \( d \) is NOT a perfect square. Can you find the inverse of \( I - D \) in this ring? $BR
