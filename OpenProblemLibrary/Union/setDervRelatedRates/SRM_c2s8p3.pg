$BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Let R be the unknown rate at which water is being
pumped in.  Then you know that if V is volume of water,
dV/dt = R- $flowRate.  Use similar triangles to
find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume
of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with
base radius r and height h is given by \(\displaystyle V=\frac{1}{3}\pi
r^2 h\). ";

# Main text

Context()->texStrings;
BEGIN_TEXT
Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate
of $flowRate \( {\rm m}^3{\rm /min}\).  At the same time water is
being pumped into the tank at a constant rate.  The tank has height
$height meters and the diameter at the top is $diameter meters.

If the water level is rising at a rate of $levelRate m/min
when the height of the water is $level meters, find the rate at
which water is being pumped into the tank.
$PAR
Water is being pumped in at \{ ans_rule(20) \} \( {\rm m}^3{\rm /min}\).
