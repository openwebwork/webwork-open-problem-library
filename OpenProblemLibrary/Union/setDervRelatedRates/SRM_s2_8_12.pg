# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
At noon, ship A is $a1 nautical miles due west of ship B.
Ship A is sailing west at $b1 knots and ship B is sailing north at $c1 knots.
How fast (in knots) is the distance between the ships changing at $t1 PM?
$PAR
The distance  is changing at \{ans_rule(35) \} knots.
$PAR
(Note: 1 knot is a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour.)
