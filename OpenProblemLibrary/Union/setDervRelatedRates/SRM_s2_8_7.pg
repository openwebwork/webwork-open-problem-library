# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
A street light is at the top of a $a1 foot tall pole. A 6 foot tall woman
walks away from the pole with a speed of $b1 ft/sec along a straight path.
How fast is the tip of her shadow moving when she is $c1 feet from the
base of the pole?
$PAR
The tip of the shadow is moving at \{ans_rule(20) \} ft/sec.
