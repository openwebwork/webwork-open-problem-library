BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that an object moves along an \(s\)-axis
so that its location is given by \( s(t) = $s\) at time
\(t\).  (Here \(s\) is in meters and \(t\) is in seconds.)
$PAR
(a) Find the average velocity  of the object  in meters per second over the time interval \(t=$time1\) to \(t=$time2\) seconds.
$PAR
Average velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\} m/s.
$PAR
(b) Find the instantaneous velocity  of the object  in meters per second at \(t = $time3\) seconds.
$PAR
Instantaneous velocity =  \{ans_rule(20)\} m/s.
