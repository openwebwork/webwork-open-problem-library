$FORM_INTERVAL ="$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Your answer should be a single
interval, such as (0,1), or two or more intervals separated by
${LQ}U$RQ for the union of two intervals, such as (-infinity, 2) U (3,
4).  If there are no intervals on which \(f\) is decreasing, enter
${LQ}none$RQ.";

$FORM_LIST_INF = "$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD If there are no inflection points, enter
${LQ}none$RQ. If there is more than one, enter the \(x\)-values as a
comma-separated list, e.g. 1, 2";
