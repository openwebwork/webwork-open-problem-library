BEGIN_TEXT
\{image(insertGraph($graph),width=>300,height=>300,tex_size=>900)\} $BR
$PAR
Identify the graphs A (blue), B(red) and C (green) as the graphs
of a function \(f(x)\) and its derivatives \(f'(x)\) and
\(f''(x)\).
$BR
(Clicking on the sketch will give you a version of the picture in a
separate window.)
$PAR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function, \(f(x)\) .
$BR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function's first derivative,
   \(f'(x)\) .
$BR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function's second derivative,
   \(f''(x)\) .
$PAR
$BBOLD Hint: $EBOLD
Remember that \(f'(x)\) is itself a function,
and we can find the derivative of the function \(f'(x)\),
which is called the second  derivative of the function \(f(x)\)
and denoted by \(f''(x)\).
