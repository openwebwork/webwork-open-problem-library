# Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Follow the steps below to answer the following question:
$PAR
For what values \( a \) and \( b \) is the line \( $c x + y = b \)
tangent to the curve \( y = a x^{$n} \) at the point with \( x = $d \)?
$PAR
(A) Use the limit process, as we did in class,
to find the slope of the tangent line to \( y = a x^{$n} \)
when \( x = $d \). (Your answer will contain an \(a\).)
$PAR
The slope of the tangent line to \( y = a x^{$n} \)
when \( x = $d \) is
\{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
(B) What is the slope of the line \( $c x + y = b \)?
$PAR
The slope of this line is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
(C) In order for the line \( $c x + y = b \) to be tangent to
the curve \( y = a x^{$n} \) at \( x = $d \), we need for the
slope of the tangent line to \( y = a x^{$n} \) at \( x = $d \)
to be the same as the slope of the line \( $c x + y = b \).
$PAR
Thus in comparing (A) and (B), we find that
\( a =\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
(D) Lastly, in order for the line \( $c x + y = b \) to be tangent to
the curve \( y = a x^{$n} \) at \( x = $d \), the graphs of
\( $c x + y = b \) and \( y = a x^{$n} \) must have the same \(y\)-coordinate
at \(x = $d\).
$PAR
Comparing the \(y\)-coordinates of the two graphs
tells us that
\( b =\) \{ ans_rule(20) \}
