An information technology company produces \($a \)$PERCENT of its computer chips at a plant in St. Louis and the remainder of its chips at a plant in Chicago.  It is known that \($STLdefective \)$PERCENT of the chips produced in St. Louis are defective, while \($CHIdefective\)$PERCENT of the chips produced at the plan in Chicago are defective.  What is the probability that a randomly chosen computer chip produced by this company is defective and was produced in St. Louis?
