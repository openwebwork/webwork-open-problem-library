Suppose that for retirement purposes, over the course of $time1 years, you make monthly deposits of \($payment\) into an ordinary annuity that pays an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded monthly.  After those $time1 years, you then want to make monthly withdrawals for $time2 years, reducing the balance in the account to zero dollars.

$PAR
a) Find the amount of money you have accumulated in the annuity over the first $time1 years: \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR

$PAR
b) How much should you withdrawing monthly from your account so that the balance reaches zero dollars after the final $time2 years? \{ANS_RULE(10)\}
$PAR

(${BBOLD}Note:$EBOLD Your answers should have a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
To find the amount of money in the account after $time1 years, we simply use the formula
$PAR\[
FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}
\]$PAR
and solve for FV:
$PAR\[
FV = $payment \cdot \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{$n1} - 1}{\frac{$dec}{12}} = $answer1.
\]$PAR
To find the amount that can be withdraw for the next $time2 years, we use the present value formula with \(PV = $answer1\) and solve for PMT:
$PAR\[
$answer1 = PMT \frac{1 - \left(1 + \frac{$dec}{12} \right)^{-$n2}}{\frac{$dec}{12}},
\]$PAR
which yields \(PMT = $answer2\).
