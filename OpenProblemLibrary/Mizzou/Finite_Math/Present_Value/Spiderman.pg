Starting on July 1, 2000, Peter borrows \($L\) each year for 4 years from his dear Aunt May to pay for college.  (Note: the last date that he borrows money is July 1, 2003.) From the beginning, Aunt May agreed to defer all interest on the loans until Peter finds a job; i.e. Peter's loans will not accumulate any interest until the first day he starts working.  After that, Peter will be charged $ip percent compounded semiannually, and he will pay Aunt May back with $n equal semiannual payments, the first coming 6 months after he starts his job.  Peter finds a job as a photographer for a local newspaper, and his first day of work is July 1, 2004. For tax reasons, Peter needs to compute the total amount of interest that he will pay to Aunt May in the year 2007. How much in interest did Peter actually pay in 2007?
