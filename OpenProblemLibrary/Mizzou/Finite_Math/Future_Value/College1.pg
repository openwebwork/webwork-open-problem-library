Tom and Sandy have set up a sinking fund in order to have \( $fv\) in \($t \) years for their child's college education.  How much should be paid monthly into an ordinary annuity earning \($r $PERCENT\) compounded monthly so that they reach their goal?  How much interest is earned during the last year?

-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is a simple application of 
\[
FV = PMT \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}
\]
$PAR
where \(FV = $fv, i = \frac{$dec}{12} = $i, \text{ and } n = 12 \cdot $t = $n\).  We need to solve for \(PMT\).  Plugging everything in and solving, we see that \(PMT = $ans\).
