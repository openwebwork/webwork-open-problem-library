A merchandise vendor at a sports arena is given a large uncounted pile of hats and shirts to sell at a game.  Hats cost $p1 each, and shirts sell for $p2 each.  At the end of the night, the vendor realized he forgot to keep track of how many quantities of each item he sold.  However, he does know that he sold $u total items and sold $a of merchandise.  How many hats did he sell?
