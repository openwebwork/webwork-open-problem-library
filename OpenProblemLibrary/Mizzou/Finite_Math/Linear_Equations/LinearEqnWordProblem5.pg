BEGIN_TEXT  
Eugene's financial advisor invests money for Eugene into two accounts.  Account 1 earns a simple interest rate of \($r1$PERCENT\).  Account 2 earns \($r2$PERCENT\) simple interest but is a riskier investment.  Eugene isn't told how much was invested in each account, but he knows that he invested $t total, and he earned $i in interest (before commission) after 3 years.  How much was invested in each account?

$PAR

Amount invested in Account 1 = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$BR
Amount invested in Account 2 = \{ans_rule(15)\}
