An arena held a concert and sold tickets for two types of seats: lawn seats and regular seats.  Lawn seats cost $p1 and regular seats cost $p2.  If the arena sold $u tickets, and their revenue from ticket sales was $a, how many of each type of ticket did they sell?

Number of lawn seats = \{ans_rule(5)\}

Number of regular seats = \{ans_rule(5)\}
