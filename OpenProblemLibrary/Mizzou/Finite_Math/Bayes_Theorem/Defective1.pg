BEGIN_TEXT
Factories A and B produce computers. Factory A produces $n times as many computers
as factory B. The probability that an item produced by factory A is defective is
$pda and the probability that an item produced by factory B is defective is $pdb.
$BR
A computer is selected at random and it is found to be defective. What is the 
probability it came from factory A?
$BR
Answer:\{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
