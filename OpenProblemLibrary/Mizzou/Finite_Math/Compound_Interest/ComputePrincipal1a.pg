How much do you need to invest in an account earning an annual interest rate of \($annual_interest_rate $PERCENT\) compounded $periodically, so that your money will grow to \($Amount\) in \($time\) $periods?


$PAR
The amount you need to invest is \{ANS_RULE(10)\}

(${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answers should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)

$PAR
-------------------------------
$BR   $BBOLD Solution: $EBOLD
$PAR
This is an application of the formula \(A = P(1+i)^n\) with 
\[
A = $Amount, \qquad i = \frac{r}{m} = \frac{$dec}{$compoundings_per_year}, \qquad \text{and} \qquad n = $compoundings_per_year \cdot $time.
\]
$PAR
This yields \(P = $answer\).
