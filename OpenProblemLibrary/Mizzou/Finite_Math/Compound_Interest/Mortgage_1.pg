Fifteen years ago a couple purchased a house for \( $house_value \) by paying a 
20$PERCENT down payment and financing the remaining balance with a 30-year mortgage at \($rate\)$PERCENT compounded monthly.

$PAR
Monthly Payment: \{ans_rule(10)\} (${BBOLD}Note: $EBOLD Your answer should include a dollar sign and be accurate to two decimal places)
