A biomedical research company produces \($a $PERCENT\) of its insulin at a plant in Kansas City, and the remainder is produced at a plant in Jefferson City.  Quality control has shown that \($b $PERCENT\) of the insulin produced at the plant in Kansas City is defective, while \($c $PERCENT\) of the insulin produced at the plant in Jefferson City is defective.  What is the probability that a randomly chosen unit of insulin came from the plant in Jefferson City given that it is defective?
