BEGIN_TEXT
One of two urns is chosen at random with one just as likely to be chosen as the other.  Then a ball is withdrawn from the chosen urn.  Urn 1 contains $a white and $b red balls, and urn 2 has $c white and $d red balls.
$PAR
If a white ball is drawn, what is the probability that it came from urn 1?
$PAR
\{ANS_RULE(10)\}
