BEGIN_PGML
A gas station sells [$total1] gallons of gasoline per hour if it charges $[$pp2] per gallon but only [$total2] gallons per hour if it charges $[$pp1] per gallon. Assuming a linear model


a) How many gallons would be sold per hour of the price is $[$npp] per gallon?

    [_]{$ans1}

b) What must the gasoline price be in order to sell [$total3] gallons per hour?

    $[_]{$ans2}

c) Compute the revenue taken at the four prices mentioned in this problem -- $[$pp2], $[$npp], $[$pp1] and your answer to part (b). Which price gives the most revenue?

    $[_]{$ans3}

d) What is the price that the gas station should charge to maximize revenue?

    $[_]{$ans2}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We need to find the linear model, which we will write at
[``` G(x) = m x + b ```]
where [`x`] will be the price of the gasoline and [`G(x)`] will be total number of gallons per hour gasoline is sold.

The problem gives two points [`([$pp2],[$total1])`] and [`([$pp1],[$total2])`].  We'll use these to find the slope with
[``` m= \frac{g_2 - g_1}{p_2 - p_1} = \frac{[$total2]-[$total1]}{[$pp2]-[$pp1]} = [$slope] ```]
We will use this slope and the point [`([$pp2],[$total1])`] in the model as
[``` [$total1] = [$slope] \cdot [$pp2] + b ```]
and solving for [`b`] results in [` b= [$yint] `] resulting in the model
[``` G(x) = [$slope] x + [$yint] ```]

a) To find this answer, we'll subsitute in $[$npp] into the model or [` G([$npp]) = [$slope]\cdot [$npp] + [$yint] = [$ans1] `]
