#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Including $a$PERCENT sales tax, an inn charges $price per night.
Find the nightly cost at the inn before tax is added.
$PAR
(a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let \(x\) 
represent the nightly cost before tax.
$PAR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
$PAR
$BR
(b) Solve the equation to find nightly cost before tax. (Note: Your answer should
be in the form $BITALIC $DOLLAR$string.$EITALIC)
$PAR
Answer: \{ans_rule(20) \}
