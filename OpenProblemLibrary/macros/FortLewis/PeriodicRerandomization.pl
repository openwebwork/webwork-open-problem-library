=head1 NAME

PeriodicRerandomization.pl - forced re-randomization of the 
problem every p submissions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Let p be a positive integer.  This macro provides the ability
to force a re-randomization of the question every p attempts.
For example, this macro can be used to create a practice exercise 
that provides a new version of the question every 4 attempts 
and displays a solution every fourth attempt.

The argument of C<PeriodicRerandomization()> is a number p (the period) 
that is the number of attempts allowed before the problem is 
re-randomized.  C<PeriodicRerandomization()> must be called before
any random parameters are defined.

The two arguments of C<PeriodicStatus()> are (1) the text that will 
appear on the button for a new version of the problem when the number 
of attempts is 0 mod p, and (2) a message that will appear when the 
number of attempts is not 0 mod N.  If C<PeriodicStatus()> has no 
arguments, then it will use defaults.  

There are several globally defined variables.  C<$rerand_period> is 
the period p.  C<$attempts_modp> is the total number of attempts modulo 
the period except for when the problem is first accessed, in which case
its value is -p (the rationale behind this is that the case when the 
problem is first accessed often needs to be handled separately.)  
C<$attempts_modp_remaining> is the number of attempts 
remaining before re-randomization.  C<$problem_version_number> is the 
floor function applied to the total number of attempts divided by the 
period p.  C<$newProblemSeed> is the problem seed for the current
version of the problem, whereas C<$problemSeed> is the original
problem seed (which does not change with different versions of the 
problem).  You can access the total number of attempts using
C<$envir{numOfAttempts}>, which is a sequence 0,0,1,2,3,... (not
0,1,2,3,...).
