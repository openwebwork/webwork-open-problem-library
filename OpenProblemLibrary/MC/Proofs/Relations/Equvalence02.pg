BEGIN_TEXT
Drag \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} statements from the left to the right side below, and arrange them them in the correct order to produce a proof of the following proposition.  
$PAR
$BBOLD Proposition. $EBOLD Let \(\mathbb{Z}-$LBRACE 0 $RBRACE\) denote the set of nonzero integers.  Define a relation \(R\) on \(A = \mathbb{Z} \times (\mathbb{Z}-$LBRACE 0 $RBRACE)\) by: 
$BR
\[ ((a,b),(c,d)) \in R \iff ad=bc  \]
Then \(R\) is an equivalence relation on the set \(A\).
