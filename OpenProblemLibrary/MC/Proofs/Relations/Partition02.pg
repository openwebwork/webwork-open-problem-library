BEGIN_TEXT
Among the options below there are \{ $CorrectProof->numNeeded \} different 
partitions of the set \(A = \lbrace 0, 1, 2, \dots , $n \rbrace\).  List them on the right according to the number of equivalence classes that each partition induces.
Here, \(Z_k= \lbrace 0, 1, \ldots, k-1\rbrace\).

$PAR
\{ $CorrectProof->Print \}
