$PAR
Consider the graph of
\[y = \sin(bx) \]
for some fixed value of \(b\).  Using the interactive application and properties of the sine function, estimate smallest non-zero values for \(b\) and \(a\) and determine a solution \(x\) for the equation:
\[\sin(bx) = \sin(bx+a) \]

BEGIN_HINT
$BR
To determine \(b\), from the graph first determine the period of the given curve.
$BR
To determine \(a\), notice the difference between the two points.
$BR
To get the solution \(x\), move the x value so that the two points are at the same y-value.  
Then the two expressions will be equal.
$BR
Look at the picture to determine where the sine curve reaches its maximum.  When the two points are at the same y-value, this maximum will be exactly in the middle of the points.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
$BBOLD 
SOLUTION 
$EBOLD
$BR
Only half of a cycle of the sine curve is given so $BBOLD half $EBOLD the period equals \(\frac{\pi}{$b}\) and so the whole period equals \(\frac{2\pi}{$b}\).  
$BR
Using the formula "period" = \(\frac{2\pi}{b}\) gives \(b = $b\).
$PAR
The horizontal difference between the two points is always \(d =$d\).  However, the original equation can be written as
 \[\sin(bx) = \sin(bx+a) = \sin(b(x+a/b)) = \sin(b(x+d)) \] 
and so the horizontal distance \(d\) between the points must satisfy \(d=a/b\).  Since you obtained \(b=$b\) using the period of the curve, then you can solve for 
\[a = b d = ($b)($d) = $a\]
$PAR
Finally, to get the solution \(x\), notice that one "hump" of this sine curve is symmetrical about 
\(\frac{\pi}{2b}\).  
$PAR
But, \[\sin(bx+a) = \sin(b(x+a/b) \] and so these two points must be a total of \(\frac{a}{b}\) apart.
$PAR
Taking half of this distance and adding to the lower x-value \(bx\) leaves you at the middle point of the hump.  That is
\[bx + \frac{a}{2b} = \frac{\pi}{2b}\]
Solving for x gives
\[x = \frac{\pi-a}{2b^2}\]
Using the given values for \(a = $a\) and \(b = $b\) in this problem gives 
\[x = \frac{\pi-$a}{2($b^2)} = $soln\]
