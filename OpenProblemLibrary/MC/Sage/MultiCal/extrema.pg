## PRESERVING INTERACT STATE:
## this section preserves previous the state of the browser as long as the state
## can be determined from the previous answer. Basically the method uses the saved
##  answer to reset the state of the interact.

$answer_value = ${$inputs_ref}{sageAnswer};

## As written this interact is not recording its state and there is no sageAnswer
## The interact is just used as a visual aid 
## for the student.

BEGIN_HINT
$PAR
To determine minimums, move the red dot very near the middle of one of the lightest regions.
$BR
To determine maximums, move the red dot to the darkest regions.
$BR
Saddle points occur where the contour plot rises on two opposing sides and decreases on the other two opposing sides.
$PAR
Numerically, consider using \(x = $c11\) somewhere and perhaps \(y = $c22\)
