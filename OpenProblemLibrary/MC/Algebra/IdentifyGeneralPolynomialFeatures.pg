#  Setup

Context("Numeric");

#  Degree of the polynomial.  Will do a lot but probably should not be huge.
#  Needs to be at least n=2 to keep out of trouble below.
$n = 6;

#  Create random but nice coefficients
$c[0] = non_zero_random(-9.5,9.5,1);
$pows[0] = "";

}
#  Change the second coefficient either 1 or -1 for the fun of it
$c[1] = random(-1,1,2);

#   Create a reference to the arrays c and pows for use in nicestring below.
#   Outside of pg, this would really be \@c
$coefs = ~~@c;    
$powers = ~~@pows;

#   This built-in function makes a nice looking polynomial from the part above. 
$poly = nicestring($coefs,$powers);

#   This part creates each of the monomial terms and a table for presentation

for (my $k=2;$k<=$n;$k++)

}

#   Create a table for presenting the questions and entering the answers

{
   $table = $table . row( "\[$term[$k]\]", ans_rule(10), ans_rule(10))

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
The leading term of a polynomial is the monomial with the highest power on the variable \(x\).  For this problem, that leading term is \[$c[$n]*x^{$n}\].
$PAR
The degree of the polynomial is the power of \(x\) on this leading term.  Here that would be \($n\).  
$BR
The leading coefficient is the scalar associated with the leading term.  This is  \($c[$n]\).
$PAR
The individual monomials of various degrees have coefficients and powers created in a similar manner as the leading term.
