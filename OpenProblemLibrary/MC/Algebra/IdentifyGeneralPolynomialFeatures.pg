#  Setup

Context("Numeric");

#  Needs to be at least n=2 to keep out of trouble below.

#  Change the second coefficient either 1 or -1 for the fun of it

#   Create a reference to the arrays c and pows for use in nicestring below.
#   Outside of pg, this would really be \@c

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR
The leading term of a polynomial is the monomial with the highest power on the variable \(x\).  For this problem, that leading term is \[$c[$n]*x^{$n}\].
$PAR
The degree of the polynomial is the power of \(x\) on this leading term.  Here that would be \($n\).  
$BR
The leading coefficient is the scalar associated with the leading term.  This is  \($c[$n]\).
$PAR
The individual monomials of various degrees have coefficients and powers created in a similar manner as the leading term.
