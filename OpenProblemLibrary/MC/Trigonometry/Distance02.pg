BEGIN_TEXT
$BR
The midpoint of the line segment that joins the given points is given by:
\((\)\{ans_rule(6) \},\{ans_rule(6)\}\()\).

&ANS(std_num_cmp($midy));

BEGIN_HINT
$PAR
For radius, use the Pythagorean Theorem with 
$BR
\(a = (x_2-x_1) = ($x2) - x_1\) and 
$BR
\(b = (y_2-y_1) = ($y2) - y_1\).
$BR
For midpoints, average \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) to get the x-coordinate and \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) to get the x-coordinate.
END_HINT

SOLUTION
$EBOLD
To get the distance between the points, the Pythagorean Theorem 
\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\] 
can be utilized by setting
$BR
$BCENTER 
\(a = ($x2) - ($x1)\) and \(b = ($y2) - ($y1)\).
$ECENTER
$BR
Computing these gives
$BR
$BCENTER 
\( ($xdiff)^2 + ($ydiff)^2 = $d^2\).
$ECENTER 
$BR
Therefore, the distance is \( \sqrt{ $d^2 } = $d \).
$PAR
Averaging the x-coordinates and averaging the y-coordinates gives \( ($x1\)+\($x2)/2 = $midx\) and \( ($y1\)+\($y2)/2 = $midy\).  So, the midpoint is \(($midx,$midy)\).
