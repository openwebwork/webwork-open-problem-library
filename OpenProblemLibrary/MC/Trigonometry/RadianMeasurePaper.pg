$BBOLD Writing Assignment $EBOLD
$PAR
Prepare a paper (greater than one page with 10 point font) discussing radian measure and the unit circle.  In the paper, be certain to:
$BR
$BR - use some flexible item as the definition of unit measure.  1-2 feet long is good.
$BR - draw a circle by holding one end and rotate a pen (or sidewalk chalk) along the other end
$BR - lay the flexible item along the perimeter of the circle.  One length along the circle gives an angle of one radian;  Two lengths give two radians;  1/2 of a length gives 1/2 of a radian;  etc.  In this manner, create physical examples for each of the following values.  Take a picture of your results and share these in your paper.
$BR
\{$al->print_q\}  
$PAR 

Prepare a paper, with appropriate references, and share with your instructor.
