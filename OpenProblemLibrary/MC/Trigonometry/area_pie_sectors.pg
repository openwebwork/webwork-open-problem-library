BEGIN_TEXT
You instructor is considering the installation of a circular dart board with radius \($r\) on the office wall.  instead of actually reading your papers, it has been suggested that grades be assigned by chance by dividing the board into three grade sectors and tossing a dart.
$PAR
The area of an "A" sector with central angle \($angle1\) is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
The area of a "B" sector with central angle \($angle2\) is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
The area of a "C" sector with central angle \($angle3deg ^o\) is \{ ans_rule(20) \}.
$PAR
Assume a dart is randomly thrown at the board and the grade is noted on your paper.  
List your grade in order of increasing likelihood: 
$BR   
\{ $popup_largest->menu() \}  \{ $popup_middle->menu() \}  \{ $popup_smallest->menu() \} .
$PAR
If the chance of your receiving a given grade is based upon the size of the sector divided by the size of the whole circle, determine the likelihood that you will receive an "A".  
\{ ans_rule(20) \}

SOLUTION
$EBOLD
$PAR
PAR
The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula \(A = r^2 \theta /2\).  Therefore:
$PAR
the "A" sector with central angle \($angle1\) has area \($r^2*$angle1 /2 = $area1\).
$BR
the "B" sector with central angle \($angle2\) has area \($r^2*$angle2 /2 = $area2\).
$BR
the "C" sector with central angle \($angle3\) has area \($r^2*$angle3 /2 = $area3\).  Remember you must convert degrees to radians before using the formula.  The given data is in degrees.
$PAR
Assume a dart is randomly thrown at the board and the grade is noted on your paper.  
$PAR

Ranking the areas above from largest to smallest to get the most to least likely outcome.  For your data, the correct order of likelihood is 
$popup_largest ,
$popup_middle ,
$popup_smallest
$PAR
The size of the whole circle is \(\pi ($r)^2\).  So, the ratio of area of the A sector over the area of the entire circle is \(\frac{$area1}{\pi ($r)^2} = $probA\).
