You are approaching the island of Hawaii in a small boat.  The highest
point on Hawaii is Mauna Loa at 13,677 feet.  You see it just barely
above the horizon.  The radius of Earth is 3,963 miles.  Ignoring
atmospheric effects, you figure that you are \{ ans_rule(10) \} miles
in a straight line from the top of Mauna Loa.

$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Draw the triangle whose vertices are the top of
Mauna Loa, your boat, and the center of the earth. Apply the
Pythagorean
Theorem.  A mile has 5,280 feet.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Drawing the picture as indicated in the hint gives a right triangle
where one short side is the unknown distance \(d\), and the other is
the radius of earth, \(r\). The long side is the radius of earth plus
the height of the mountain, \(r+h\) where \(r=3963\) miles and
\(h=13,677\) feet.  Of course we need to use consistent units, and so
we convert the height of th mountain to \(h = \frac{13677}{5280}\)
miles. The Pythagorean Theorem tell us that \[r^2 + d^2 = (r+h)^2.\]
We need to know \(d\).  Expanding on the right and subtracting \(r^2\)
on both sides gives the equation \[d^2= r^2+2rh+h^2-r^2 = 2rh+h^2.\]
Hence \[d=\sqrt{2rh + h^2}.\] Plugging in the values we are given
yields \(d=143.31\) miles.
