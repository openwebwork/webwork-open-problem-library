Consider a circle with center \( ($h ,$k ) \) which has a point
on the circle at \( ($x1 ,$y1) \).
$BR
First, determine the radius of the circle:  \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
$BR
Finally, an equation for the circle with center ($h,$k) and passing through ($x1,$y1) is given by:
$BR
$BCENTER
\( (x - \)\{ans_rule(2)\} \( )^2 + 
   (y - \)\{ans_rule(2)\} \( )^2 = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}.

BEGIN_HINT
$PAR
Use the distance formula to find out how far is is between the two given points.  Since one point is the center and the other is on the circle, this also happens to be the radius of the circle.
$BR
To write out the equation of the circle, use the standard formula for a circle and plug in the correct values for the center coordinates and for the radius.  Look especially at the radius and be certain to answer the question precisely as posed in this problem.

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR

SOLUTION
$EBOLD
The standard equation for a circle is given by
\[ (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \] 
Since the center \((h,k)\) is given in this problem, one must determine the radius first.  To do this, the Pythagorean Theorem 
\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\] 
can be utilized by setting
$BR
$BCENTER 
\(a = ($x1) - ($h)\) and \(b = ($y1) - ($k)\).
$ECENTER
$BR
Computing these gives
$BR
$BCENTER 
\( ($xdiff)^2 + ($ydiff)^2 = $r2\).
$ECENTER 
$BR
Of course, this is the same as using the distance formula directly if you remember that formula.  
$BR
So the radius is \[ \sqrt{ $r2 } \approx $r \]
$PAR
Finally, fill in the blanks with \( h = $h, k = $k, r^2 = $r2 \) to get
\[ (x-$h)^2 + (y-$k)^2 = $r2 \]
