BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you are given a \(30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle with hypotenuse of length \($c\).  
$BR
Determine the length of the two sides.  
$BR(Enter these below in order so that the first one is not larger than the second.)
$PAR
First leg  = \{ans_rule(10)\}
Second leg = \{ans_rule(10)\}

BEGIN_HINT
In a \(30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle, the length of the shortest leg is half that of the hypotenuse.
$BR
The Pythagorean Theorem can be used to then obtain the length of the other leg.

$PAR
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  
For a \(30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle, the length of the shortest leg is half that of the hypotenuse. 
$BR
Therefore, the shortest leg \(= $c/2 = $a \)
$BR
The other leg is \(\sqrt{3}\) longer than the shorter leg.  Indeed, by using the Pythagorean Theorem with \(a = c/2\)
\[ (c/2)^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
\[ c^2/4 + b^2 = c^2\]
Taking the first term to the other side 
\[ b^2 = c^2 - c^2/4 = 3c^2/4\]
and taking square roots gives
\[ b = \sqrt{3}c/2 = \sqrt{3}a\]

$BR
Therefore, the other leg \(= \sqrt{3}\times$a = $b \).
