BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you are given a \(45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle with hypotenuse of length \($c\).  
$BR
Determine the length of the two sides.  
$BR(Enter these below in order so that the first one is not larger than the second.)
$PAR
First leg  = \{ans_rule(10)\}
Second leg = \{ans_rule(10)\}

ANS(num_cmp($a));
ANS(num_cmp($b));

BEGIN_HINT
This is an isosceles triangle.
END_HINT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  
In an isosceles triangle, both legs are the same length.  So, both legs are of equal length, say \(a\).  
$BR
By the Pythagorean Theorem, 
\[a^2+b^2 = a^2+a^2 = 2a^2 = c^2 = $c^2\] 
Dividing by 2 and taking a square root gives \(a = \sqrt{$c^2/2} = $a = b\) 
EOT
