BEGIN_TEXT
An jet is waiting to land at a busy airport and so is flying around the airport in a perfectly circular manner with radius \($r\) miles.   They are going pretty fast and discover that they are completing \($rpms\) revolutions per minute. 
$PAR
The angle covered per minute is \{ ans_rule(20) \} radians.
$PAR
The airspeed of the plane is \{ ans_rule(20) \} miles per hour.
$PAR
A camera in the control tower is taping the plane's flight.  The speed that the camera must turn to keep up is \{ ans_rule(20) \} radians per second.
$PAR
The total angle (in radians) that the camera turns in \($time\) minutes is \{ans_rule(20)\}.

BEGIN_HINT
 $PAR
1 RPM means an angle of \(2\pi\) per minute.
$BR
Airspeed is linear velocity.   The camera rotates at a certain angular velocity. 
$BR
Be certain to consider correct units and pay attention to seconds vs minutes vs hours.

SOLUTION
$EBOLD
$BR
Traveling at \($rpms\) revolutions per minute means that the angle covered per minute is \($rpms \frac{revolution}{minute}* 2\pi\frac{radians}{revolution} = $ans1 \).
$PAR
Airspeed is linear velocity.  
Using the distance along a circular arc \(s = r*\theta\), airplane distance traveled per minute is radius times angle per minute: \($r *$rpms * 2\pi =$r*$ans1 \).  
$BR
Since the question asked for speed per hour, multiply by 60:  
This gives \($r * $rpms * 2\pi * 60 = $linear_velocity \).
$PAR
Camera rotation is angular velocity or angle per minute: \($rpms * 2\pi /60 =$ans2\).
$PAR
\($rpms\) revolutions per minute requires that the camera turn at \($rpms * 2\pi\) radians per minute.  Divide by 60 to get \($ans2\) radians per second.
