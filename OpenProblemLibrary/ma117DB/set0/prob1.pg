$c = random(2,11,1);
$d = random(2,11,1);

BEGIN_TEXT
This problem demonstrates how you enter numerical answers into WeBWorK. $PAR
Evaluate the expression \(($b )($c -$d)\)=
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR

END_TEXT


$ans = ($b)*($c-$d);

ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>"strict"));

BEGIN_TEXT
In the case above you need to enter a number, since we're testing whether you can multiply
out these numbers. (You can use a calculator if you want.) 
$PAR
For most problems, you will be able to get WeBWorK to
do some of the work for you. For example
$BR
Type the expression exactly as it appears into the answer box:$BR
 $c/$d + $a*$b \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
Now replace the * with a space: $BR
$c/$d + $a $b \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
Click on the$BBOLD Preview Answers$EBOLD button below. You will see: $BR
the answer box,$BR
parsed: this is how the computer read your answer,$BR
value: this is the number your answer is,$BR
and a nicely displayed version of your answer.$PAR
Particulary, notice what$BBOLD value$EBOLD is for these two answers.$PAR
On the Preview Answers page, click on$BBOLD Submit Answers$EBOLD to have your answers graded.
$BR
You could "Submit Answers" now, but it is a very good habit to always preview your answers.
$PAR
Click on $BBOLD Next $EBOLD at the top of the page to go to the next problem.
