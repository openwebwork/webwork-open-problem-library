TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose an object is dropped from a height \(h_0\) above the ground.
Then its height after \(t\) seconds is given by
\(h=-16t^2+h_0\), where \(h\) is measured in feet.
If a ball is dropped from $a feet above the ground, how long does
it take to reach ground level?

$BR  
Your answer is \{ ans_rule(20) \} seconds.
