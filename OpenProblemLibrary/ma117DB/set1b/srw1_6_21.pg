A plumber and his assistant work together to replace the pipes in an old 
house. The plumber charges 45 dollars per hour for his own labor and 25 
dollars for his assistant's labor. The plumber works twice as long as 
his assistant on this job, and the labor charge on the final bill is $sum. 
How long did the plumber work on this job?
