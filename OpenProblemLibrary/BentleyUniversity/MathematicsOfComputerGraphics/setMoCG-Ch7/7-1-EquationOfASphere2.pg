BEGIN_PGML
Consider a sphere with center [`([$a],[$b],[$c])`] and radius [`[$r]`].

Is the point [`([$a+$dx1],[$b+$dy1],[$cdz1str])`] on (the surface of) the sphere?  (Note that these values have been rounded to two decimal places, so you should be forgiving to one or two decimal points when you test.)

Pick your answer from here: [___]{PopUp( [ (
  '(make a choice)',
  'Yes, the point is on the sphere',
  'No, the point is not on the sphere',
  'There is not enough information to tell'
) ], ( $wrongOne == 1 ) ?
       'No, the point is not on the sphere' :
       'Yes, the point is on the sphere' )}

Is the point [`([$a+$dx2],[$b+$dy2],[$cdz2str])`] on (the surface of) the sphere?  (Again, these values have been rounded to two decimal places, so you should be forgiving to one or two decimal points when you test.)

Pick your answer from here: [___]{PopUp( [ (
  '(make a choice)',
  'Yes, the point is on the sphere',
  'No, the point is not on the sphere',
  'There is not enough information to tell'
) ], ( $wrongOne == 2 ) ?
       'No, the point is not on the sphere' :
       'Yes, the point is on the sphere' )}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We write the equation of the sphere:

[`(x-[$a])^2+(y-[$b])^2+(z-[$c])^2=[$r]^2`]

We test the point [`([$a+$dx1],[$b+$dy1],[$cdz1str])`] in the sphere equation:

[`([$a+$dx1]-[$a])^2+([$b+$dy1]-[$b])^2+([$cdz1str]-[$c])^2=[$r]^2`]

[`[$dx1]^2+[$dy1]^2+[$dz1str]^2=[$r**2]`]

[`[$lhs1str]=[$r**2]`]

[$explain1]

We test the point [`([$a+$dx2],[$b+$dy2],[$cdz2str])`] in the sphere equation:

[`([$a+$dx2]-[$a])^2+([$b+$dy2]-[$b])^2+([$cdz2str]-[$c])^2=[$r]^2`]

[`[$dx2]^2+[$dy2]^2+[$dz2str]^2=[$r**2]`]

[`[$lhs2str]=[$r**2]`]

[$explain2]
