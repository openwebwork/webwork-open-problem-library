TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_PGML
Suppose a computer program needs to apply an affine transformation to a complex three-dimensional object made up of [$npts] points. The transformation is composed of [$nmats] matrices (call them [`M_1`] through [`M_{[$nmats]}`]), so for each point [`(x, y, z)`] in the object, the following operation is performed.

[`
\left[\begin{array}{c} ~ \\ ~ M_1 ~ \\ ~ \end{array}\right] ~
\left[\begin{array}{c} ~ \\ ~ M_2 ~ \\ ~ \end{array}\right] ~
\left[\begin{array}{c} ~ \\ ~ M_3 ~ \\ ~ \end{array}\right] ~
\cdots
\left[\begin{array}{c} ~ \\ ~ M_{[$nmats-1]} ~ \\ ~ \end{array}\right] ~
\left[\begin{array}{c} ~ \\ ~ M_{[$nmats]} ~ \\ ~ \end{array}\right] ~
\left[\begin{array}{c} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1 \end{array}\right]
`]

Each multiplication of a matrix times a column vector involves 16 multiplications (of one number by another) and 12 additions, for a total of 28 arithmetic operations. Each multiplication of a matrix times another matrix involves 64 multiplications and 48 additions, for a total of 112 arithmetic operations.  (These numbers are not made up or chosen randomly; they are facts about [`4\times 4`] matrix multiplication.)

-----

The most inefficient way of applying the transformation to the [$npts] points would be to begin on the left, multiplying [`M_1`] by [`M_2`], then that result by [`M_3`], and so on along the list from left to right, and doing the same [$nmats] multiplications again for each of the [$npts] points.  How many arithmetic operations would this require for transforming one point?

Answer: [_____]{$ans1}

How many would it require in total for transforming all [$npts] points?

Answer: [_____]{$ans2}

-----

A more efficient method would be to start on the right, first multiplying [`M_{[$nmats]}`] by the column vector, then multiplying [`M_{[$nmats-1]}`] by that result, and so on, proceeding along the list from right to
left.

How many arithmetic operations would this require for transforming one point?

Answer: [_____]{$ans3}

How many would it require in total for transforming all [$npts] points?

Answer: [_____]{$ans4}

Using this method would therefore save what percentage of the time of the previous method?

Answer: [_____]{(1-$ans4/$ans2)*100}%

-----

The most efficient method would be to multiply the [$nmats] matrices together and call that result [`A`] (without yet multiplying [`A`] by any column vector). After computing [`A`] (just once of course), multiply [`A`] by each of the [$npts] points, each represented as a column vector.

How many arithmetic operations would it take to compute [`A`]?

Answer: [_____]{$nmats*112-112}

How many arithmetic operations would it require to multiply [`A`] by one point?

Answer: [_____]{28}

How many would this method require in total?

Answer: [_____]{$ans5}

Using this method would therefore save what percentage of the time of the previous method?

Answer: [_____]{100*(1-$ans5/$ans4)}%

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
To transform one point the inefficient way requires [`[$nmats-1]\times 112=[$nmats*112-112]`] for the [$nmats-1] matrix multiplications, plus another 28 for the final matrix-by-column-vector multiplication, for a total of [$ans1].

To transform [$npts] the inefficient way is that previous answer times [$npts], which is [$ans2].

-----

If we proceed from right to left instead, then each multiplication is a matrix-times-column-vector multiplication, and thus requires only 28 operations.  Since there are [$nmats] matrices, it takes [`[$nmats]\times 28=[$ans3]`] operations to transform one point.

To transform all [$npts] points, it requires [`[$ans3]\times [$npts]=[$ans4]`] operations.

To see the time percentage of this method compared to the previous, we divide [`\frac{[$ans4]}{[$ans2]}=[$ans4/$ans2]`], which is [$ans4*100/$ans2]%, for a savings of [$ans4*-100/$ans2+100]%.

-----

Multiplying the [$nmats] matrices together involves only [$nmats-1] multiplications, each of which takes 112 operations.  So the total number of operations to compute [`A`] is [`[$nmats-1]\times 112=[$nmats*112-112]`].

To apply [`A`] to a single point takes 28 operations, as the problem states.

To apply [`A`] to all [$npts] points takes [`28\times [$npts]=[$npts*28]`] operations, to which we add the [$nmats*112-112] operations we needed to compute [`A`], making the total number of operations in this method equal to [`[$npts*28]+[$nmats*112-112]=[$ans5]`].

To see the time percentage of this method compared to the previous, we divide [`\frac{[$ans5]}{[$ans4]}=[$ans5/$ans4]`], which is [$ans5*100/$ans4]%, for a savings of [$ans5*-100/$ans4+100]%.
