BEGIN_TEXT

A nutrition expert claims that the average American is overweight.
To test his claim, a random sample of $n Americans was selected,
and the difference between each person's actual weight and idea weight 
was calculated.  For this data, we have \(\bar{x} = $xbar\) and
\(s = $s\).  Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the 
expert's claim is true?  Carry out a hypothesis test at a  
$siglev$PERCENT significance level.
$PAR

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).
$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(40) \} $PAR 
$PAR
C. The p-value is \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR
