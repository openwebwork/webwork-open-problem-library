BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose that a sample has been drawn from a normal population to
conduct the hypothesis test
$PAR
$PAR
\(\displaystyle
\qquad
\begin{array}{rrcl}
H_0: & \sigma^2 & = & $var \\
H_1: & \sigma^2 & > & $var \\
\end{array}\)
$PAR
Assume that you know that the sample variance is \(s^2=$s2 \), 
the sample size is \(n = $n \), and take \(\alpha = $alpha\).  
Draw the sampling distribution, and use it to determine 
each of the following:
$PAR  

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).
$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR 
$PAR
C. The p-value is \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR

\{ $mc ->print_q() \} $BR
\{ $mc ->print_a() \}
