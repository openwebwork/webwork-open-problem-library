simple random sample is drawn from each set, this is called simple random sampling.",

"The target population is the population about which we want to draw 
inferences and conclusions, while the sampled population is the actual 
population from which the sample has been taken.",

"Self-selected samples are almost always unbiased, because the individuals 
who participate in them are less interested in the issues than the other 
members of the population.",

that exists only because of the observations that happened to be selected for the sample.",

"Two major types of errors can arise when a sample of observations is taken from a 
population: sampling error and nonsampling error.",

"Nonresponse error refers to error, or bias, introduced when responses are not 
obtained from some members of the sample.  When this happens, the sample observations 
that are collected may not be representative of the target population, resulting in bias results.",
