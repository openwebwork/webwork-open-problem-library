Three contractors (call them A, B, and C) bid on a 
project to build an addition to the UVA Rotunda.  Suppose
that you believe that Contractor A is $a times more likely 
to win than Contractor B, who in turn is $b times more likely to win
than Contractor C.  What are each of their probabilities of winning?
