"A multiple regression model has the form \(\hat{y}=b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2\).

involving 5 independent variables and 30 observations, the numerator 
and denominator degrees of freedom for the critical value of \(F\)

independent variables, \(SST=475\) and \(SSE=71.25\).  The multiple

"A multiple regression model has the form \(\hat{y}=6.75+2.25x_1+3.5x_2\).  
As \(x_1\) increases by 1 unit, holding \(x_2\) constant, then the value 
of \(y\) will increase by 9 units.",

\(x_2\) were to increase by 5 units, holding \(x_1\) and \(x_3\) 
constant, the value of \(y\) would decrease on average by 50 units.",

there are three independent variables, the null hypothesis is
