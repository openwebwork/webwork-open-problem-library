"A multiple regression model has the form \(\hat{y}=b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2\).

involving 5 independent variables and 30 observations, the numerator

As \(x_1\) increases by 1 unit, holding \(x_2\) constant, then the value 
of \(y\) will increase by 9 units.",

constant, the value of \(y\) would decrease on average by 50 units.",
