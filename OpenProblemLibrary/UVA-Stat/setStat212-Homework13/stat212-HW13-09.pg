"Excel prints a second \(R^2\) statistic, called the coefficient 
of determination adjusted for degrees of freedom, which has been 
adjusted to take into account the sample size and the number of 
independent variables.",
"T",

"In multiple regression, the standard error of estimate is defined 
by \(s_\epsilon=\sqrt{SSE/(n-k)}\),where \(n\) is the sample size 
and \(k\) is the number of independent variables.",
"F",

"In regression analysis, the total variation in the dependent 
variable \(y\) measured by \(\sum{(y_i-\bar{y})^2}\), can be 
decomposed into two parts: the explained variation, measured by 
\(SSR\), and the unexplained variation, measured by \(SSE\).",
"T",

"In multiple regression, a large value of the test statistic \(F\) 
indicates that most of the variation in \(y\) is unexplained by the 
regression equation and that the model is useless.  A small value 
of \(F\) indicates that most of the variation in \(y\) is explained 
by the regression equation and that the model is useful.",
"F",

"In multiple regression, when the response surface (the graphical 
depiction of the regression equation) hits every single point, the 
sum of squares for error \(SSE=0\), the standard error of estimate 
\(s_\epsilon=0\), and the coefficient of determination \(R^2=1\).",
"T",

"In multiple regression with \(k\) independent variables, the 
\(t-\)tests of the individual coefficients allows us to determine 
whether \(\beta_i\not=0\) for\(i=1,2,...,k\), which tells us whether 
a linear relationship exists between \(x_i\) and \(y\).",
"T",

"In multiple regression, and because of a commonly occurring problem 
called multicollinearity, the \(t-\)tests of the individual coefficients 
may indicate that some independent variables are not linearly related 
to the dependent variable when in fact they are.",
"T",

"In multiple regression, the problem of multicollinearity affects 
the \(t-\)tests of the individual coefficients as well as the \(F-\)test 
in the analysis of variance for regression, since the \(F-\)test combines 
these \(t-\)tests into a single test.",
