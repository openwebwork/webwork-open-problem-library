$PAR 
The probability that a university graduate will be 
offered no jobs within a month of graduation is 
estimated to be $a1$PERCENT.  The probability of 
receiving one, two, and three job offers has similarly 
been estimated to be $a2$PERCENT, $a3$PERCENT, and 
$a4$PERCENT, respectively.  Determine the following 
probabilities:
$PAR
A.  P(A graduate is offered fewer than two jobs) =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  P(A graduate is offered more than one job) =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
