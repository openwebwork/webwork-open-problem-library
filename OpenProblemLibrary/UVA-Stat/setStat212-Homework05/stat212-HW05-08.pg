BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
The owner of a small firm has just purchased a 
personal computer, which she expects will serve 
her for the next two years.  The owner has been 
told that she "must" buy a surge suppressor to 
provide protection for her new hardware against 
possible surges or variations in the electrical 
current, which have the capacity to damage the 
computer.  The amount of damage to the computer 
depends on the strength of the surge.  It has 
been estimated that there is a $a1$PERCENT chance 
of incurring $c1 dollar damage, $a2$PERCENT chance 
of incurring $c2 dollar damage, and $a3$PERCENT 
chance of incurring $c3 dollar damage from a surge within the next two years.  An inexpensive suppressor, 
which would provide protection for only one surge, 
can be purchased.  How much should the owner be 
willing to pay if she makes decisions on the basis 
of expected value?

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Let the random variable \( D \) be the amount of damage to the computer (in dollars) caused by a surge within the next two years.  

Then 
\[ \begin{aligned}
E[D] &= $c1 \cdot P(D=$c1) + $c2 \cdot P(D=$c2) + $c3 \cdot P(D=$c3) \\
& = $c1 \cdot $b1 + $c2 \cdot $b2 + $c3 \cdot $b3\\
& =  $ans
\end{aligned} \]
Hence the owner expects her computer to incur $DOLLAR$ans of damage from a surge in the next two years and so should be willing to pay $DOLLAR$ans for a surge protector.
