To examine the effectiveness of its four annual 
advertising promotions, a mail order company has 
sent a questionnaire to each of its customers, 
asking how many of the previous year's promotions 
prompted orders that would not have otherwise 
been made.  The accompanying table lists the 
probabilities that were derived from the questionnaire, 
where X is the random variable representing the number 
of promotions that prompted orders.  If we assume 
that overall customer behavior next year will be 
the same as last year, what is the expected number 
of promotions that each customer will take advantage 
of next year by ordering goods that otherwise would 
not be purchased?

A previous analysis of historical records found 
that the mean value of orders for promotional 
goods is $c5 dollars, with the company earning 
a gross profit of $c6$PERCENT on each order.  
Calculate the expected value of the profit 
contribution next year.

The fixed cost of conducting the four promotions is 
estimated to be $c8 dollars with a variable cost 
of $c9 dollars per customer for mailing and handling 
costs.  What is the minimum number of customers required by the company 
in order to cover the cost of promotions?  (Round your answer to the 
next highest integer.)
