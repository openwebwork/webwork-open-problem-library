$PAR
In the game of blackjack as played in casinos in Las Vegas, 
Atlantic City, Niagara Falls, as well as many other cities, 
the dealer has the advantage.  Most players do not play very well.  
As a result, the probability that the average player wins a hand is 
about $p1.  Find the probability that an average player wins

$PAR
A.  twice in 5 hands.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  $r or more times in $n hands.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
$PAR
There are several books that teach blackjack players the 
"basic strategy" which increases the probability of winning 
any hand to $p2. Assuming that the player plays the basic 
strategy, find the probability that he or she wins
