BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR A sign on the pumps at a gas station encourages 
customers to have their oil checked, and claims that 
one out of $a cars needs to have oil added.  If this
is true, what is the probability of each of the
following:

$PAR
A. One out of the next four cars needs oil.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. Two out of the next eight cars needs oil.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
C. 10 out of the next 40 cars needs oil.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
