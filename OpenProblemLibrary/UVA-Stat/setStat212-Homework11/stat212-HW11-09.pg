BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Two statistics teachers both believe that each has the smarter
class.  To put this to the test, they give the same final
exam to their students.  A summary of the class sizes, class means, 
and standard deviations is given below:
$PAR
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
n_1 = $n1, & \bar{x}_1 = $xbar1, & s_1 = $s1 \\
n_2 = $n2, & \bar{x}_2 = $xbar2, & s_2 = $s2 \\
\end{array}
\]
$PAR
Is there evidence, at an \(\alpha = $alpha\) level of significance,
to conclude that there is a difference in the two classes?  (Assume 
that the population variances are equal.)  Carry out an appropriate
hypothesis test, filling in the information requested.
$PAR

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).
$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR
