BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Two random samples are taken, one from among first-year students and the other from
among fourth-year students at a public university.  Both samples are asked if they favor modifying the student Honor 
Code.  A summary of the sample sizes and number of each group
answering ``yes'' are given below:
$PAR
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
\mbox{First-Years (Pop. 1)}: & n_1 = $n1, & x_1 = $x1 \\
\mbox{Fourth-Years (Pop. 2)}: & n_2 = $n2, & x_2 = $x2 \\
\end{array}
\]
$PAR
Is there evidence, at an \(\alpha = $alpha\) level of significance,
to conclude that there is a difference in proportions between 
first-years and fourth-years? 
Carry out an appropriate
hypothesis test, filling in the information requested.
$PAR

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).
$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR 
$PAR
C. The p-value is \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR
