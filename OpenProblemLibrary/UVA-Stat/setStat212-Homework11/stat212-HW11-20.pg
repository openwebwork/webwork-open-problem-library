BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
A marketing research firm suspects that a particular product
has higher name recognition among college graduates than among 
high school graduates.  A sample from each population is selected,
and each asked if they have heard of the product in question.  
A summary of the sample sizes and number of each group
answering ``yes'' are given below:
$PAR
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
\mbox{College Grads (Pop. 1)}: & n_1 = $n1, & x_1 = $x1 \\
\mbox{High School Grads (Pop. 2)}: & n_2 = $n2, & x_2 = $x2 \\
\end{array}
\]
$PAR
The company making the product is willing to increase marketing 
targeted at high school graduates if the difference between the
two groups is at least 5$PERCENT.
Is there evidence, at an \(\alpha = $alpha\) level of significance,
to support such an increase in marketing? 
Carry out an appropriate
hypothesis test, filling in the information requested.
$PAR

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).
$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR 
$PAR
C. The p-value is \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR

\{ $mc ->print_q() \} $BR
