$PAR
A medical researcher wants to investigate the amount of time it takes 
for patients' headache pain to be relieved after taking a new prescription 
painkiller.  She plans to use statistical methods to estimate the mean of 
the population of relief times.  She believes that the population is normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of $a minutes.  How large a sample should 
she take to estimate the mean time to within $b minutes 
with ${conlev}$PERCENT confidence?
