One of the few negative side effects of quitting smoking is weight gain.  
Suppose that the weight gain in the 12 months following a cessation in 
smoking is normally distributed with a standard deviation of $stdev pounds.  
To estimate the mean weight gain, a random sample of $n quitters was drawn 
and the sample mean was found to be $mean pounds.  Determine the ${conlev}$PERCENT 
confidence interval estimate of the mean 12-month weight gain for all quitters.
$PAR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For each confidence interval, enter your answer in the form
(LCL, UCL).  You must include the parentheses and the comma between the confidence limits.
