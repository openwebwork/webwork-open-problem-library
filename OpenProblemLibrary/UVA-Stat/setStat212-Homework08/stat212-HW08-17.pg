A medical statistician wants to estimate the average weight loss of people 
who are on a new diet plan.  In a preliminary study, he guesses that the 
standard deviation of the population of weight loss is about $a pounds.  
How large a sample should he take to estimate the mean weight loss to 
within $b pounds, with ${conlev}$PERCENT confidence?
