BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
The operations manager of a large production plant would like to estimate 
the average amount of time workers take to assemble a new electronic component.  
After observing a number of workers assembling similar devices, she guesses 
that the standard deviation is $a minutes.  How large a sample of workers 
should she take if she wishes to estimate the mean assembly time to within 
$b seconds.  Assume the confidence level to be ${conlev}$PERCENT.

Sample Size = \{ans_rule(15)\}
