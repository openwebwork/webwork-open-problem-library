The number of cars sold annually by used car salespeople is normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of $stdev.  A random sample of $n salespeople 
was taken and the mean number of cars sold annually was found to be $mean.  Find 
the ${conlev}$PERCENT confidence interval estimate of the population mean.

(LCL, UCL).  You must include the parentheses and the comma between the confidence limits.
