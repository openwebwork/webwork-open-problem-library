BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
A statistics professor wants to compare today's students with 
those 25 years ago.  All of his current students' marks are stored 
on a computer so that he can easily determine the population mean.  
However, the marks 25 years ago reside only in his musty files.  
He does not want to retrieve all the marks and will be satisfied 
with a ${conlev}$PERCENT confidence interval estimate of the mean mark 25 
years ago.  If he assumes that the population standard deviation 
is $a, how large a sample should he take to estimate the mean to within $b marks?
