Among the most exciting aspects of a university professor's life are the 
departmental meetings where such critical issues as the color the walls 
will be painted and who gets a new desk are decided.  A sample of 20 
professors was asked how many hours per year are devoted to such meetings.  
The responses are listed below.  Assuming that the variable is normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of $stdev hours, estimate the mean 
number of hours spent at departmental meetings by all professors.  Use a 
confidence level of ${conlev}$PERCENT.
