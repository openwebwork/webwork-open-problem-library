BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR A sample of 12 measurements has a mean of $mean and a standard deviation of $stdev.  
Suppose that the sample is enlarged to 14 measurements, by including two additional 
measurements having a common value of $mean each.
$PAR
A. Find the mean of the sample of 14 measurements.
$PAR
Mean = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. Find the standard deviation of the sample of 14 measurements.
$PAR
Standard Deviation = \{ans_rule(15)\}
