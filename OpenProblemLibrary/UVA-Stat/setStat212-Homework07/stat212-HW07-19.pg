$PAR
A professor of statistics noticed that the marks in his 
course are normally distributed.  He also noticed that 
his morning classes average $mu1$PERCENT with a standard 
deviation of $sigma1$PERCENT on their final exams.  
His afternoon classes average $mu2$PERCENT with a standard 
deviation of $sigma2$PERCENT.
$PAR
A.  What is the probability that a randomly selected student 
in the morning class has a higher final exam mark than a 
randomly selected student from an afternoon class?  
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}

B.  What is the probability that the mean mark of 
four randomly selected students from a morning class 
is greater than the average mark of four randomly 
selected students from an afternoon class?

Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
