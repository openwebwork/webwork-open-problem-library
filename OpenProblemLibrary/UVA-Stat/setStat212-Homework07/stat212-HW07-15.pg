$PAR
A psychologist believes that $a$PERCENT of male drivers 
when lost continue to drive, hoping to find the location 
they seek rather than ask directions.  To examine this 
belief, he took a random sample of $b male drivers and 
asked each what they did when lost.  If the belief is 
true, determine the probability that less than $c$PERCENT 
said they continue driving.
