BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
The manager of a restaurant believes that waiters 
and waitresses who introduce themselves by telling 
customers their names will get larger tips than 
those who don't.  In fact, she claims that the 
average tip for the former group is $mu1$PERCENT 
while that of the latter is only $mu2$PERCENT.  
If tips are normally distributed with a standard 
deviation of $sigma1$PERCENT, what is the probability 
that in a random sample of $n tips recorded from waiters 
and waitresses who introduce themselves and $n tips from 
waiters and waitresses who don't, the mean of the former 
will exceed that of the latter?
