The manufacturer of cans of salmon that are supposed to have 
a net weight of 6 ounces tells you that the net weight is 
actually a normal random variable with a mean of $mu ounces 
and a standard deviation of $sigma ounce.  Suppose that you 
draw a random sample of $sampnum cans.  Find the probability 
that the mean weight of the sample is less than $a ounces.
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
