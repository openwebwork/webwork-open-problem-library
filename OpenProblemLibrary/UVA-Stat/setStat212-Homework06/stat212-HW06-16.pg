BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
Because of the relatively high interest rates, most 
consumers attempt to pay off their credit card bills 
promptly.  However, this is not always possible.  An 
analysis of the amount of interest paid monthly by a 
bank's Visa cardholders reveals that the amount is 
normally distributed with a mean of $a dollars and a 
standard deviation of $b dollars.
$PAR
A.  What proportion of the bank's Visa cardholders 
pay more than $c dollars in interest? 
$PAR 
Proportion  =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  What proportion of the bank's Visa cardholders 
pay more than $d dollars in interest? 
$PAR 
Proportion  =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
C.  What proportion of the bank's Visa cardholders pay 
less than $e dollars in interest? 
$PAR 
Proportion  =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
D.  What interest payment is exceeded by only $f$PERCENT 
of the bank's Visa cardholders? 
$PAR 
Interest Payment  =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
