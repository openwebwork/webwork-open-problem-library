$PAR
The manager of a gas station has observed that the times required 
by drivers to fill their car's tank and pay are quite variable.  
In fact, the times are exponentially distributed with a mean of 
$mu minutes.  What is the probability that a car can complete the 
transaction in less than $a minutes?
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
