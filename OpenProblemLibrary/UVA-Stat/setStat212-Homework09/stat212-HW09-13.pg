$PAR
A machine that produces ball bearings is set so that the average 
diameter is $mu inch.  A sample of $samp ball bearings was 
measured with the 
results shown below.
$PAR
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc} 
$ball1 & $ball2 & $ball3 & $ball4 & $ball5 \\
$ball6 & $ball7 & $ball8 & $ball9 & $ball10
\end{array}
\]
$PAR
Assuming that the standard deviation is $sigma inch, can we 
conclude at the $sig$PERCENT significance level that the mean diameter is not $mu inch?
$PAR

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}
$PAR
$PAR

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).

$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR
