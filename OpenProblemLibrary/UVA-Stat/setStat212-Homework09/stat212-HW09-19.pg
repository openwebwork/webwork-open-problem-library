BEGIN_TEXT

A dean in the business school claims that GMAT scores 
of applicants to the school's MBA program have increased 
during the past 5 years.  
Five years ago, the mean and standard deviation of GMAT 
scores of MBA applicants were $mu0 and $sigma, respectively.  
$n applications 
for this year's program were randomly selected and the GMAT 
scores recorded.  If we assume that the distribution of GMAT 
scores of this 
year's applicants is the same as that of 5 years ago, find the 
probability of erroneously concluding that there is not enough evidence 
to supports the claim when, in fact, the true mean GMAT score is $mu1.  
Assume \(\alpha\) is $alpha.
