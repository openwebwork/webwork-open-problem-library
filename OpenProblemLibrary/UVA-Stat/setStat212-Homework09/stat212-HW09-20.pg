BEGIN_TEXT

In an attempt to reduce the number of person-hours lost 
as a result of industrial accidents, a large production 
plant installed new safety equipment.  
In a test of the effectiveness of the equipment, a random 
sample of $n departments was chosen.  The number of person-hours 
lost in the month prior to 
and the month after the installation of the safety equipment was 
recorded and the percentage change was calculated.  Find the 
probability that the test
is unable to conclude that the new safety equipment is effective 
when the mean percent reduction is actually $mu1$PERCENT.  Assume that the population standard 
deviation is $sigma$PERCENT and that \(\alpha\) is $alpha.
