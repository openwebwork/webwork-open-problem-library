Past experience indicates that the monthly long-distance 
telephone bill is normally distributed with a mean of $mu 
dollars and a 
standard deviation of $sigma dollars.  After an advertising 
campaign aimed at increasing long-distance telephone usage, a random 
sample of $samp household's bills was taken.  The data (in dollars) is below.
$PAR
\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccccccc} 
$bill1 & $bill2 & $bill3 & $bill4 & $bill5 & $bill6 & $bill7 \\

Can we conclude at the $sig$PERCENT significance level 
that the campaign was successful?  Fill in the requested information below.

A. The value of the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).

$PAR
B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic: \{ ans_rule(25) \} $PAR
