Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School 
of Medicine have determined that children under 2 years 
old who sleep with the lights on have a $a$PERCENT 
chance of becoming myopic before they are 16.  Children 
who sleep in darkness have a $b$PERCENT probability of 
becoming myopic.  A survey indicates that $c$PERCENT 
of children under 2 sleep with some light on.  Find 
the probability that a random child under 2 will become 
myopic before reaching 16 years old.
