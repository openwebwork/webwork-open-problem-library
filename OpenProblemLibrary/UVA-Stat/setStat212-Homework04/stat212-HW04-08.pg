$PAR 
A financial analyst has determined that there is a $b$PERCENT 
probability that a mutual fund will outperform the market over 
a 1-year period provided that it outperforms the market the 
previous year.  If only $c$PERCENT of mutual funds outperform 
the market during any year, what is the probability that a 
mutual fund will outperform the market 2 years in a row?
