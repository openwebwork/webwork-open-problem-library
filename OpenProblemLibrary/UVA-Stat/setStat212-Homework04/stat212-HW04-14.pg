BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
Bad gums may mean a bad heart.  Researchers discovered 
that $a$PERCENT of people who have suffered a heart 
attack had periodontal disease, an inflammation of 
the gums.  Only $b$PERCENT of healthy people have 
this disease.  Suppose that in a certain community 
heart attacks are quite rare, occurring with only 
$c$PERCENT probability.  
$PAR
A. If someone has periodontal 
disease, what is the probability that he or she 
will have a heart attack?  
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. If $a1$PERCENT of the people in a community will have 
a heart attack, what is the probability that a person 
with periodontal disease will have a heart attack?
