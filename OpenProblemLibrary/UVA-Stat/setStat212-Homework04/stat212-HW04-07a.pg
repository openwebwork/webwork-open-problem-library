$PAR 
The chartered financial analyst (CFA) is a designation 
earned after taking three annual exams (CFA I,II, and III).  
The exams are taken in early June.  Candidates who pass 
an exam are eligible to take the exam for the next level 
in the following year.  The pass rates for levels I, II, 
and III are $a, $b, and $c, respectively.  Suppose that 
3,000 candidates take the level I exam, 2,500 take the 
level II exam and 2,000 take the level III exam.  Suppose 
that one of the 7,500 candidates is selected at random.  What is the 
probability that he or she passes the exam?
