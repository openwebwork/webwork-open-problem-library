$PAR 
A foreman for an injection-molding firm admits that on 
$a$PERCENT of his shifts, he forgets to shut off the 
injection machine on his line.  This causes the machine 
to overheat, increasing the probability that a defective 
molding will be produced during the early morning run 
from $b$PERCENT to $c$PERCENT.  The plant manager randomly 
selects a molding from the early morning run and discovers 
it is defective.  What is the probability that the foreman 
forgot to shut off the machine the previous night?
