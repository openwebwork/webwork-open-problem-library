$PAR 
Suppose that at UVA, $ac$PERCENT of all undergraduates are in the College,
$ae$PERCENT are in Engineering, $acom$PERCENT are in Commerce, $an$PERCENT
are in Nursing, and $aa$PERCENT are in Architecture.  In each school, the 
percentage of females is as follows:  $fc$PERCENT in the College,
$fe$PERCENT in Engineering, $fcom$PERCENT in Commerce, $fn$PERCENT
in Nursing, and $fa$PERCENT in Architecture.  If a randomly selected student
is male, what is the probability that he's from the College?
