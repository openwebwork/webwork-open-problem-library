BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
A foreman for an injection-molding firm admits that 
on $a$PERCENT of his shifts, he forgets to shut off 
the injection machine on his line.  This causes the 
machine to overheat, increasing the probability that 
a defective molding will be produced during the early 
morning run from $b$PERCENT to $c$PERCENT.  If a molding 
is randomly selected from the early morning run  of
a random day, what is the probability that it is defective?
