BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
An aerospace company has submitted bids on two separate 
federal government defense contracts.  The company 
president believes that there is a $a$PERCENT 
probability of winning the first contract.  If they 
win the first contract, the probability of winning the 
second is $b$PERCENT.  However, if they lose the first 
contract, the president thinks that the probability of 
winning the second contract decreases to $c$PERCENT.
$PAR
A. What is the probability that they win both contracts? 
$PAR 
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. What is the probability that they lose both contracts?  
$PAR 
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
C. What is the probability that they win only one contract? 
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
