BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR 
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gathers 
data concerning the causes of highway crashes where at least one 
fatality has occurred.  From the 1998 annual study, the following 
probabilities were determined (BAC is blood-alcohol level):
$PAR
\(P(BAC = 0 | \mbox{Crash with fatality}) = $a\)
$PAR
\(P(BAC \mbox{ is between } .01 \mbox{ and } .09 | \mbox{Crash with fatality}) = $b\)
$PAR
\(P(BAC \mbox{ is greater than } .09 | \mbox{Crash with fatality}) = $c\)
$PAR
Suppose over a certain stretch of highway during a 1-year period, 
the probability of being involved in a crash that results in at 
least one fatality is $d.  It has been estimated that $e$PERCENT 
of all drivers drive while their BAC is grater than .09.  Determine 
the probability of a crash with at least one fatality if a driver 
drives while legally intoxicated (BAC greater than 0.09). 
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
