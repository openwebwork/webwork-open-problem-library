$PAR 
Three airlines serve a small town in Ohio.  Airline A 
has $a1$PERCENT of all scheduled flights, airline B 
has $a2$PERCENT and airline C has the remaining $a3$PERCENT.  
Their on-time rates are $a4$PERCENT, $a5$PERCENT, and $a6$PERCENT, 
respectively.  A flight just left on-time.  What is the probability 
that it was a flight of airline A?
