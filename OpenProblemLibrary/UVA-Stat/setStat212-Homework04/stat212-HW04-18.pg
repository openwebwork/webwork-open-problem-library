BEGIN_TEXT
Transplant operations have become routine and one common 
transplant operation is for kidneys.  The most dangerous 
aspect of the procedure is the possibility that the body 
may reject the new organ.  There are several new drugs 
available for such circumstances and the earlier the 
drug is administered, the higher the probability of 
averting rejection.  
$PAR
The New England Journal of Medicine 
recently reported the development of a new urine test to 
detect early warning signs that the body is rejecting a 
transplanted kidney.  However, like most other tests, 
the new test is not perfect.  
In fact, 20$PERCENT of people who do reject the
transplant test negative, and $a$PERCENT of people
who do not reject the transplant test positive.
Physicians know that in about 
$b$PERCENT of kidney transplants the body tries to reject 
the organ.  If the new test has a positive result (indicating 
early warning of rejection), what is the probability that 
the body is attempting to reject the kidney?
