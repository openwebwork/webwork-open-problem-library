$PAR 
Transplant operations have become routine.  One common 
transplant operation is for kidneys.  The most dangerous 
aspect of the procedure is the possibility that the body 
may reject the new organ.  There are several new drugs 
available for such circumstances and the earlier the 
drug is administered, the higher the probability of 
averting rejection.  The New England Journal of Medicine 
recently reported the development of a new urine test to 
detect early warning signs that the body is rejecting a 
transplanted kidney.  However, like most other tests, 
the new test is not perfect.  In fact, 20$PERCENT of negative  
tests and $a$PERCENT of positive tests 
prove to be incorrect.  Physicians know that in about 
$b$PERCENT of kidney transplants the body tries to reject 
the organ.  If the new test has a positive result (indicating 
early warning of rejection), what is the probability that 
the body is attempting to reject the kidney?
