$PAR 
The owner of an appliance store is interested in the 
relationship between the price at which an  item is 
sold (regular or sale price) and the customer's decision 
on whether to purchase and extended warranty.  After 
analyzing her records, she produced the following joint 
probabilities:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
                     & \mbox{Purchased} & \mbox{Did not purchase} \\ 
                     & \mbox{extended warranty} & \mbox{extended warranty} \\ \hline
\mbox{Regular Price} & $a1 & $a3 \\ \hline
\mbox{Sale Price} & $a2 & $a4 \\ 
\end{array}
\]


$PAR
A. What is the probability that a customer who 
bought an item at the regular price purchased the 
extended warranty? 
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B. What is the probability that a customer buys an extended warranty? 
$PAR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15)\}
