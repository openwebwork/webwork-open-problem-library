Data from Office on Smoking and Health, Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, indicate that 
$a1$PERCENT of adults who did not finish high school, 
$a2$PERCENT of high school graduates, $a3$PERCENT of 
adults who completed some college, and $a4$PERCENT of 
college graduates smoke.  Suppose that one individual 
is selected at random and it is discovered that the 
individual smokes.  Use the probabilities in the 
following table to calculate the probability that 
the individual is a college graduate.

Hints: This problem has all the information you need, but not in
the typical ready-to-use form.  The table above can tell you the 
proportion of people with various levels of education in the population.
Keep in mind that any degree (Associate, Bachelor, or Advanced) counts 
as graduating from college.
