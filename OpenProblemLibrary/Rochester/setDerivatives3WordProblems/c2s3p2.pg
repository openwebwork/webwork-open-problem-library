If \(f\) is the focal length of a convex lens and an object is
placed at a distance \(p\) from the lens, then its image
will be at a distance \(q\) from the lens, where \(f\), \(p\), and \(q\)
are related by the lens equation
\[ \frac{1}{f}  = \frac{1}{p}  + \frac{1}{q} \]
$PAR
What is the rate of change of \(p\) with respect to \(q\) if
\(q = $q \) and \(f = $f\)? (Make sure you have the correct sign for the rate.)
