# Remark: The ranges of values of $B, $D, $L, $M, $R$ 
# were chosen so that the problem is always well-posed 
# (that is, so that the function to be integrated is 
# always positive in the domain of interest).

# Solution: The work needed to lift the bucket itself is B*D ft-lb.
# At time t (in seconds) the bucket is x = R*t feet above its 
# original depth D feet (so t = x/R), but it now holds only 
# (M-Lt)=(M-Lx/R) pounds of water when the bucket is x feet above
# its original depth.  Moving this amount of water a distance \Delta x 
# requires (M-(L/R)x) * \Delta x foot-pounds of work.  Thus the total 
# work is the work needed to lift the water, which is the integral of 
# (M-(L/R)x) from x=0 to x=D, plus the work needed to lift the bucket,
# which is B*D.


BEGIN_TEXT

A bucket that weighs $B pounds and a rope of negligible weight are
used to draw water from a well that is $D feet deep.  The bucket is
filled with $M pounds of water and is pulled up at a rate of $R feet
per second, but water leaks out of a hole in the bucket at a rate of
$L pounds per second.  Find the work done pulling the bucket to the
top of the well.  Your answer must include the correct 
\{ helpLink('units') \}.   (You may enter
${BITALIC}lbf${EITALIC} or ${BITALIC}lb*ft${EITALIC} for
${BITALIC}ft-lb${EITALIC}.)

${BBOLD}Hint:${EBOLD} Calculate the work done lifting the bucket
(without the water) and the water (without the bucket) separately and
add them to find the total work done.  Find a function that describes
the weight of the water in the bucket when the bucket is \( x \) feet
above its starting position.
