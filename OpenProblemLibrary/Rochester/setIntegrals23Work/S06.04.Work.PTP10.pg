BEGIN_TEXT

A chain lying on the ground is $L meters long and its mass is $M
kilograms.  The chain is threaded through a pulley, which is fixed to
the ground, and pulled directly up so that it forms the shape of an L.
How much work is required to raise one end of the chain to a height of
$H meters?  Use that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 \( m/s^2
\).  You may assume that the chain slides effortlessly and without
friction along the ground as its end is lifted.  Your answer must
include the correct \{ helpLink('units') \}.

$BR$BR Work = \{ans_rule(40)\}
