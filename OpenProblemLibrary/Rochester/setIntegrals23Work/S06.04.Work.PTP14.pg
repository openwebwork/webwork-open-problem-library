BEGIN_TEXT

The ${BITALIC}spring-flex${EITALIC} exercise system consists of a
spring with one end fixed and a handle on the other end.  The idea is
that you exercise your muscles by stretching the spring from its
natural length, which is $l cm.  If a $F Newton force is required to
keep the spring stretched to a length of $L cm, how much work is
required to stretch it from $A cm to $B cm?  Your answer must include
the correct \{ helpLink('units') \}.
