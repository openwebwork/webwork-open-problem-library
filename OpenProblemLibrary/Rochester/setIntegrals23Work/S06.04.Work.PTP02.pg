BEGIN_TEXT

A circular swimming pool has a diameter of $d meters, the sides are $h meters
high, and the depth of the water is $a meters.  The acceleration due to
gravity is 9.8 \( m/s^2 \) and the density of water is 1000 \( kg/m^3
\). 

$BR How much work is required to:

$BR
(a) pump all of the water over the side?  
\{ans_rule(35)\}
$BR
(b) pump all of the water out of an outlet $c m over the side?
\{ans_rule(35)\}
$BR
Your answers must include the correct \{ helpLink('units') \}.
