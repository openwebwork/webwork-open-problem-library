BEGIN_TEXT

A rectangular tank that is $Length feet long, $Width feet wide and
$Depth feet deep is filled with a heavy liquid that weighs $Density
pounds per cubic foot.  In each part below, assume that the tank is
initially full.  Your answers must include the correct \{
helpLink('units') \}.   (You may enter
${BITALIC}lbf${EITALIC} or ${BITALIC}lb*ft${EITALIC} for
${BITALIC}ft-lb${EITALIC}.)

$BR (a) How much work is done pumping all of the liquid out over the top
of the tank?  \{ans_rule( 25) \}

$BR (b) How much work is done pumping all of the liquid out of a spout
$Spout feet above the top of the tank?  \{ans_rule( 25) \}

$BR (c) How much work is done pumping two-thirds of the liquid out over
the top of the tank?  \{ans_rule( 25) \}

$BR (d) How much work is done pumping two-thirds of the liquid out of a
spout $Spout feet above the top of the tank?  \{ans_rule( 25) \}
