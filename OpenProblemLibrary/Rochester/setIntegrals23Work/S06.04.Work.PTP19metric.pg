A rectangular tank that is $Length meters long, $Width meters wide and
$Depth meters deep is filled with a rubbing alcohol that has density $Density
kilograms per cubic meter.  In each part below, assume that the tank is
initially full, and that gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared.  
Your answers must include the correct 
\{ helpLink('units') \}.
