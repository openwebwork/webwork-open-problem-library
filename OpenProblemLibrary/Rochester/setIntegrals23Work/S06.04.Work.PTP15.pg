BEGIN_TEXT

If the work required to stretch a spring $D feet beyond its natural
length is $W foot-pounds, how much work is needed to stretch it $b
inches beyond its natural length?  Your answer must include the
correct \{ helpLink('units') \}.   (You may enter
${BITALIC}lbf${EITALIC} or ${BITALIC}lb*ft${EITALIC} for
${BITALIC}ft-lb${EITALIC}.)
