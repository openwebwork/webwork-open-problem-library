BEGIN_TEXT

A chain $L meters long whose mass is $M kilograms is hanging over the
edge of a tall building and does not touch the ground.  How much work
is required to lift the top $H meters of the chain to the top of the
building?  Use that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 meters per
second squared.  Your answer must include the
correct \{ helpLink('units') \}.

${BBOLD}Hint:${EBOLD}  Don't forget that when you lift the top $H
meters of the cable you are also lifting the bottom $C meters of the
cable, just not all the way to the top.
