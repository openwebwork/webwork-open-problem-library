 qq{The function above represents the displacement of a toy race car as it travels a
 linear track. Negative numbers mean the car is behind the starting line, positive numbers mean it is 
 in front.  Postive velocities mean it is moving forward, while negative velocities mean it is moving backwards.
 $BR
 Remember that a value which changes from -2 to -1 to 0 is increasing!
 $BR
 For each interval, enter all letters whose corresponding statements are true for that
 interval. }
