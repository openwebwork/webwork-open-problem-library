Use a graphing calculator to find the positive value of \( x \) which satisfies \( x = $a \cos(x) \).
Give the answer to 2 decimal places.\{ans_rule(30)\}

Remember to calculate the trig functions in radian mode.

qq!
$BR If you don't have a graphing calculator you can use the program Xfunctions which is
installed on most of the Macintoshes in CLARC (except for the ones in the Mac classrooms).  The
program is free and you can download it for your own computer --
see \{htmlLink( "/software/mac","Mac Software") \} -- if you have a Mac.  If you have a PC
try the CD that came with the textbook -- see if that will graph equations for you.
