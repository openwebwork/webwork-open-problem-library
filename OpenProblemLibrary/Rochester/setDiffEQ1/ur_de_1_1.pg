BEGIN_TEXT

It can be helpful to classify a differential equation, so that we can predict the techniques that might help us to find a function which solves the equation.  Two classifications are the $BBOLD order of the equation $EBOLD -- (what is the highest number of derivatives involved) and whether or not the equation is $BBOLD linear $EBOLD.
$BR 
Linearity is important because the structure of the the family of solutions to a linear equation is fairly simple.  Linear
equations can usually be solved completely and explicitly.
