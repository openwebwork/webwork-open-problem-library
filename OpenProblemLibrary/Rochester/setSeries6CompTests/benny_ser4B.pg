# We need a special problem grader on this problem, since we
# want the student to get full credit for all 3 answers correct,
# 50% credit for 2 correct, and 0% for 0 or 1 correct.
# To change this scheme, look through the following mess of code
# for the place where the variable $numright appears, and change
# that part.
# Also change the long line beginning "msg ==>", to show what will
# appear on the screen for the student.
#
# To look at the problem itself, look for the boxed comment below
# announcing the problem itself.

The three series \( \sum A_n \), \( \sum B_n \),
and \( \sum C_n \) have terms
\[ A_n = \frac{1}{n^{$a}}, \quad
B_n = \frac{1}{n^{$b}}, \quad
C_n = \frac{1}{n}. \]
Use the Limit Comparison Test to compare the following
series to any of the above series.  For each of the series
below, you must enter two letters.  The first is
the letter (A,B, or C) of the series above that it can
be legally compared to with the Limit Comparison Test.
The second is C if the given series converges, or D if it
diverges.  So for instance, if you believe the series
converges and can be compared with series C above, you
would enter CC; or if you believe it diverges and can be
compared with series A, you would enter AD.
