Here is a short review of numerical series which you may find helpful.

REVIEW OF NUMERICAL SERIES 
$BR
SEQUENCES $BR
A sequence is a list of real numbers.  It is called convergent if it
has a limit.  An increasing sequence has a limit when it has an upper bound. 


SERIES $BR
(Geometric series,rational numbers as decimals, harmonic series,divergence test)
 $BR 
Given numbers forming a sequence  \( a_1,a_2,..., \)
let us define the nth partial sum as sum of the first n of them
\( s_n  = a_1 +...+ a_n. \) $BR
The SERIES is convergent if the SEQUENCE \( s_1,s_2,s_3,... \)  is.
In other words it converges if the partial sums of the series approach a limit. $BR
A necessary condition for the convergence of this SERIES is that
a's have limit  0.  If this fails, the series diverges. $BR
The harmonic series  1+(1/2)+(1/3)+...
 diverges. $BR This illustrates that the terms \(  a_n  \)
having limit zero does not guarantee the convergence
of a series.  $BR
A series with positive terms ,i.e. \( a_n > 0 \) for all n, converges  $BR exactly when its partial sums have an upper bound. $BR
The geometric series \( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{ \infty } r^n  \) 
converges exactly when \( -1<r<1. \)  $BR

$BR 
INTEGRAL AND COMPARISON TESTS 
$BR 
(Integral test,p-series, comparison tests for convergence and divergence, limit comparison test) $BR $BR
Integral test:  Suppose \(  f(x)  \) is positive and DECREASING for
all large enough x. 
Then the following are equivalent: $BR
I. \(  \displaystyle \int_1^{ \infty } f(x)dx  \) is finite, i.e. converges. $BR
S. \( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{ \infty } \, f(n)  \) is finite, i.e. converges. $BR
This gives the p - test:
\( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{ \infty } \frac{1}{n^p}  \)  converges exactly when 
\( p > 1 .\) $BR $BR
Comparison test:  Suppose there is a fixed number K such that $BR for all sufficiently large n:
 \(  0 < a_n < K b_n . \) $BR

Convergence.  If \(  \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty  b_n  \) converges then so does 
\( \displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^\infty  a_n.  \) $BR

Divergence.  If \( \displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^\infty  a_n  \)diverges then so does 
\( \displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^\infty  b_n  \). $BR

(Positive series having smaller terms are more likely to converge.)$BR

Limit comparison test: SUPPOSE:   \( a_n > 0 \), \( b_n > 0\) and $BR 
\( \displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty } \frac{a_n}{b_n}  = R \) exists. Moreover, R is not zero. $BR 
THEN
\(  \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty  a_n  \) and \(  \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty  b_n  \) $BR
both converge or both diverge. $BR


OTHER CONVERGENCE TESTS FOR SERIES $BR
(Alternating series test, absolute convergence, RATIO TEST)
$BR
Alternating series test: Suppose the sequence \( a_1,a_2,a_3,... \) is 
decreasing and has limit zero. 
Then \(  \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty  {(-1)}^n a_n  \)   converges.
$BR This applies to (1)-(1/2)+(1/3)-(1/4)+...
$BR $BR
Absolute Convergence Test: IF
\( \displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^\infty    \vert a_n \vert \) converges, $BR
THEN \( \displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^\infty  a_n \) converges. $BR

Ratio test:$BR
SUPPOSE \( \vert { \frac {a_{n+1}}{a_n}} \vert \) has limit equal to r. $BR
IF \( r < 1 \) then \( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  a_n \) CONVERGES. $BR
IF \( r > 1 \) the  \( \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  a_n \) DIVERGES. $BR
