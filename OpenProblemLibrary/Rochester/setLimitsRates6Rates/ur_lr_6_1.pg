$BR
A rock is thrown off of a 100 foot cliff with an upward velocity of $v m/s.
As a result its height after t seconds is given by the formula:
$BR
\( h(t)=100+$v t- 5t^2 \)
$BR
What is its height after $t seconds?\{ans_rule(15)\}$BR
What is its velocity after $t seconds?\{ans_rule(15)\}$BR
(Positive velocity means it is on the way up, negative velocity means it is on the way down.)$BR
EOT

$ans1 = 100+$v*$t -5*$t*$t;
$ans2 = $v-10*$t;

ANS(num_cmp($ans1));
ANS(num_cmp($ans2));
