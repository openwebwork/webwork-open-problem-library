A factory is to be built on a lot measuring $l ft by $w ft.  A local building code specifies that a lawn of uniform width and equal in area to the factory must surround the factory.

What must the width of the lawn be? \{ ans_rule(10) \}

If the dimensions of the factory are \( A \) ft by \( B \) ft with \( A < B \), then \( A = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} and \( B = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
