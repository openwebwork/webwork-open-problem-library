BEGIN_TEXT;
You have a wire that is $length cm long.  You wish to cut it into two pieces.
One piece will be bent into the shape of a square.  The other piece 
will be bent into the shape of a circle.  Let A represent
the total area of the square and the circle.  What is the circumference of the
circle when A is a minium?
$BR$BR
The circumference of the circle is  \{ans_rule(10)\} cm.
