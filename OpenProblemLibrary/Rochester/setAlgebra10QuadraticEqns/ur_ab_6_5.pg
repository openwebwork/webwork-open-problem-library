$a = Real(random(1,6,1));
$c = Real(random(1,11-$a,1));
$b = $a+$c;
$d = $a**2 + $b**2;

$c2 = 2*$c;

BEGIN_PGML
The difference of two positive numbers is [$c] and the sum of their squares is [$d]. Find the numbers.

The bigger number is [_]{$b}{5}, and
the smaller number is [_]{$a}{5}.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let [`x`] be the bigger number.  The difference of the two numbers is [$c] so the smaller number is [`x-[$c]`]. The sum of their squares is

    [``\begin{aligned}[$d]&=x^2+(x-[$c])^2 \\
    &= x^2+x^2-[@ 2*$c @]x + [@ $c**2 @]\\
    &= 2x^2 - [@ 2*$c @]x + [@ $c**2 @] \end{aligned}``]

Subtract [$d] from both sides to obtain
    [``\begin{aligned}0&=[$f]\\&=2(x-[$b])(x-[@ $c-$b @]) \end{aligned}``]

so

    [`x=[$b]`] or [`x = [@ $c-$b @]`]

But [`x`] is supposed to be positive so it can't be [@$c-$b@].  Thus the bigger number is [`x=[$b]`], and the smaller number is [`x-[$c]=[$b]-[$c]=[@$b-$c@]`].
