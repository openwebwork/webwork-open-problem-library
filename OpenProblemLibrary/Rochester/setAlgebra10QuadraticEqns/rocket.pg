BEGIN_TEXT;
NASA launches a rocket at \(t = 0\) seconds.  Its height, in meters above 
sea-level, as a function of time is given by \(h(t) = -4.9t^2 + $v t + $h\).
$BR$BR
Assuming that the rocket will splash down into the ocean, at what time does
splashdown occur?
$BR$BR
The rocket splashes down after \{ans_rule(10)\} seconds.
$BR$BR
How high above sea-level does the rocket get at its peak?
$BR$BR
The rocket peaks at \{ans_rule(10)\} meters above sea-level.
