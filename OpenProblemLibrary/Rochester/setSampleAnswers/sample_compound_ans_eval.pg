# Here are the important lines where we build a new 
# answer evaluator using the old.  
# The new answer evaluator doesn't do much. Just adds
# the message 'experimental'.

$old_ans_eval = num_cmp($ans);

# notice that num_cmp() is a function which PRODUCES an answer evaluator 
# or technically a pointer to the answer evaluator object.  I prefer to think
# of $old_ans_eval as actually containing the answer evaluator object.

$new_eval = new AnswerEvaluator;

# now we have a new, empty answer evaluator

$new_eval->install_evaluator(sub {my $rh_ans=shift; 
                                  $rh_ans = $old_ans_eval->evaluate($rh_ans->{student_ans});
                                  $rh_ans->{ans_message}='experimental'; 
                                  $rh_ans;} 
);

# We have added a new filter to the new answer evaluator.
# The structure of a filter is that it is supposed to be a subroutine 
# which accepts an answerHash object and returns an answerHash object.
# The first problem is that an AnswerEvaluator is not subroutine 
# (it's more complicated) so one can't use
# &$old_ans_eval($answer_hash) to process an answer hash, you need to say
# $old_ans_eval->evaluate($answer_hash).  
# For this routine we wrap a subroutine around the old answer evaluator 
# so that it will behave correctly.
# [Note:  The evaluate routine in AnswerEvaluator should (IMHO) be modified 
# so it can accept filters which are answer evaluators as well as ones
# which are ordinary subroutines. This won't be too hard, only a few hours work. ] 

# Secondly, even that might not work -- most answer evaluators, the ones built 
# with all of the AnswerEvaluator tools accept either
# a string input, OR an AnswerHash input.  Some of the older answer evalatuors, 
# may not do this reliably 
# -- there has not yet been a lot of reuse of answer evaluators so 
# there has not been much testing in this area.
# That appears to be the case with num_cmp type evaluators, so 
# instead of feeding it an answerHash
# we find the student answer inside the AnswerHash and feed it that. It will 
# take some work, but 
# eventually we should be able to refit all answer evaluators 
# so that they will accept either a 
# string or an AnswerHash and can therefore be used one inside the other.
# At the moment the evaluators produced by str_cmp aren't 
# even AnswerEvaluator objects, they are subroutines!


# The final thing the filter does is to add the string 'experimental' to the 
# answer message of the AnswerHash, just to prove that we've actually done
# something.  You could do much more.

# Final note -- I often use $rh_ans, the $rh_ means it's a pointer (reference) to a 
# hash value, this way I can remember that the scalar variable holds something
# more complicated than a single value.  I also use $r_ for reference, and $ra for 
# a reference to an array.  Unfortunately I'm not consistent about this, but I use
# technique when I'm likely to get confused as to what is a value and what is a pointer.

ANS($new_eval);
