This problem demonstrates how you can write your own procedure to check answers.  
The procedure is embedded right in the problem. If you wanted to use it for several 
problems, you could put it in a file similar to "PGanswermacros.pl" and load it into
the problem.
See \{ htmlLink("http://webwork.math.rochester.edu:8088/docs/techdescription/pglanguage/anseval.html","Answer Evaluators") \}  
for documentation on how to write these procedures.$PAR

This problem asks you to enter a palindrome, a word, number, or phrase that is the same 
when read backwards or forward.  For example, madam or Hannah.  For us a standard
palindrome will ignore spaces and case, but a strict palindrome will not. So e.g. Hannah
is a standard but not a strict palindrome.  We will write a test for both types.  You can see
the code for the test by viewing the \{ htmlLink(alias("sample_myown_ans.html"),"source", q!TARGET="source"!)\} 
for this problem.
$BR $BR
Enter a standard palindrome such as "Hannah", "1234321", or "Mom". $BR
This uses std${US}palindrome${US}test $BR
\{ans_rule(60) \}

    $in = uc $in;          # Make letters uppercase  ## use ~~ inplace of perl's backslash in problems
