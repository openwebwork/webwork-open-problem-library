This problem demonstrates various WeBWorK procedures for dealing with string answers. 
See \{ htmlLink("/webwork_system_html/docs/techdescription/pglanguage/anseval.html","Answer Evaluators") \}  
for documentation on these procedures.$PAR

Enter the string ${LQ}Hi${SPACE}${SPACE}there.${RQ} without the quotes but don't 
forget the period.  Spaces before the ${LQ}H${RQ} and after the ${LQ}.${RQ} are
ignored, but otherwise you must enter the string exactly as given with 2 spaces 
between the words.  Actually, viewing this in html, you will not see the two spaces,
but they are really there.
$BR
This uses strict${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(1,30) \}
$BR $BR
END_TEXT
$ans = "Hi  there.";
ANS(strict_str_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT;
Now enter the string ${LQ}Hi${SPACE}${SPACE}there.${RQ} again.  This time all 
multiple spaces are treated as a single space. E.g. you can enter as many
spces as you want between the ${LQ}Hi${RQ} and the ${LQ}there.${RQ} 
and your answer will still be accepted as correct.

$BR
This uses std${US}cs${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(2,30) \}
$BR $BR
END_TEXT
$ans = "Hi  there.";
ANS(std_cs_str_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT;
Finally enter the string ${LQ}Hi${SPACE}${SPACE}there.${RQ} a third time.  This 
time case is ignored and all multiple spaces are treated as a single space. 
E.g. ${LQ}hi there.${RQ} and ${LQ}hI${SPACE}${SPACE}${SPACE}${SPACE}THerE.${SPACE}${SPACE}${RQ} 
are valid answers.
$BR
This uses std${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(3,30) \}
$BR $BR
END_TEXT
$ans = "Hi  there.";
ANS(std_str_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT;
Next enter the string ${LQ}A c D d B${RQ} .  All spaces are ignored so ${LQ}AcDdB${RQ} 
and ${LQ}A  c DdB${RQ} 
are valid answers.
$BR
This uses ordered${US}cs${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(4,30) \}
$BR $BR
END_TEXT
$ans = "A c D d B";
ANS(ordered_cs_str_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT;
Enter the string ${LQ}A c D d B${RQ} again.  This time spaces and case are ignored so 
${LQ}acddb${RQ} and ${LQ}A CDDB${RQ} 
are valid answers.
$BR
This uses ordered${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(5,30) \}
$BR $BR
END_TEXT
$ans = "A c D d B";
ANS(ordered_str_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT;
Enter the string ${LQ}A c D d B${RQ} once more.  Now the order and spaces are 
ignored so ${LQ}ABcDd${RQ} and ${LQ} B d D c A${RQ} 
are valid answers.
$BR
This uses unordered${US}cs${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(6,30) \}
$BR $BR
END_TEXT
$ans = "A c D d B";
ANS(unordered_cs_str_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT;
Finally enter the string ${LQ}A c D d B${RQ} one last time.  This time the order, 
spaces, and case are ignored so ${LQ}abcdd${RQ} and ${LQ} B D d C A${RQ} are 
valid answers.
$BR
This uses unordered${US}str${US}cmp $BR
\{ANS_RULE(7,30) \}
