This problem demonstrates how WeBWorK handles 
numerical answers involving units.  WeBWorK can handle all units that
are used in elementary physics courses.
See \{ htmlLink("http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/phy121/help_units.html","answers with units") \}  
for more details. $PAR

Two perpendicular sides of a triangle are $fx m and
$fy m long respectively.  
What is the length of the third side of the triangle?$BR$BR
You can answer this in terms of m's, cm's, km's, in's, ft, etc. but you must enter the units. $BR$BR
Check "Show Hint" and then "Submit Answer" if you don't remember the Pythagorean theorem.
