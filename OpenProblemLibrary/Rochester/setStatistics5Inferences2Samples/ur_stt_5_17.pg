BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you wanted to estimate the difference between two population means correct to within \($b\)
with probability \($prob\).  If prior information suggests that the popluation variances are
approximately equal to \(\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 = $sigma\) and you want to select independent random
samples of equal size from the poulations, how large should the sample sizes, \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) be?
$BR
answer: \(n_1 = n_2 = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
