BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose a group of \($n\) smokers (who all wanted to give up smoking) were randomly assigned to recieve an
antidepressant drug or a placebo for six weeks.  Of the \($n1\) patients who recieved the
antidepressant drug, \($x1\) were not smoking one year later.  Of the \($n2\) patients who
recieved the placebo, \($x2\) were not smoking one year later.  Given the null hypothesis \(H_0:
(p_1 - p_2) = 0\) and the alternative hypothesis \(H_a: (p_1 - p_2) \ne 0\), conduct a test to see
if taking an antidepressant drug can help smokers stop smoking.  Use \(\alpha = $alpha\) $BR
(a) \( \ \) The rejection region is \(|z| >\) \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
(b) \( \ \) The test statistic is \(z = \) \{ans_rule(50)\} $BR
