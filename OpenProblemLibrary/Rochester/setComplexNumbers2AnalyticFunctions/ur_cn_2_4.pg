BEGIN_TEXT
A uniformly charged infinite rod, standing perpendicular to the \(z\)-plane at the point \(z_0\),
generates an electric field at every point in the plane. The intensity of this field varies inversely as
the distance from \(z_0\) to the point and is directed along the line from \(z_0\) to the point. $PAR
If three such rods are located at the points \($x\ +\ $y i\), \( - $x\ +\ $y i\), and \(0\), find the positions of
equilibrium (i.e., the points where the vector sum of the fields is zero).\((\)Hint: \(F(z)\ =\
\frac{1}{(\overline{z}\ -\ \overline{z}_0\ ) })\)$PAR
Enter all answers in the following answer blank, separated by commas :$PAR
