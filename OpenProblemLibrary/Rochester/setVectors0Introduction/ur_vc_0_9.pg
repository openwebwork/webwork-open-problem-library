BEGIN_TEXT
Two dwarves decide to bore a tunnel through the center of the earth, connecting the mines of Moria with its
antipode. They each have identical drills. One dwarf begins drilling from Moria and the other dwarf begins
drilling from the antipode. When they meet at the center of the earth, are their two drills turning in the same
direction? Type Y if yes, N if no.
