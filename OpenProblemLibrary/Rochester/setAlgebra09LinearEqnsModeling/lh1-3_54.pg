Suppose that you are taking a course that has 4 tests. The first three tests are for 100 points each and the fourth test is for 200 points. To get an B in the course, you must have an average of at least 80 percent on the 4 tests. Your scores on the first 3 tests were \($a\), \($b\), and \($c\). What is the minimum score you need on the fourth test to get an B for the course?.
