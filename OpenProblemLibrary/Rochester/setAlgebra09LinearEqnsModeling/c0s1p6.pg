$BBOLD Remark:$EBOLD To be able to order the sizes of the windows you are going to have to calculate
the area for all five windows from knowing their widths.  Since there are several
calculations it will  save time to figure out and simplify a formula which calculates
 the area from the width
and the perimeter.
