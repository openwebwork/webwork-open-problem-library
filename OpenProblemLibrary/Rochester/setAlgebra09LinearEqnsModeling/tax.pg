Taxylvania has a tax code that rewards charitable giving.  If a person gives
\(p\)$PERCENT of his income to charity, that person pays \(($TAX - $RATE p)\) 
$PERCENT tax on the remaining money.  For example, if a person gives 10$PERCENT
of his income to charity, he pays $example1 $PERCENT tax on the remaining money.
If a person gives $example2 $PERCENT of his income to charity, he pays no tax on
the remaining money.  A person does not receive a tax refund if he gives more 
than $example2 $PERCENT of his income to charity.  Count Taxula earns $DOLLAR
$INCOME.  What percentage of his income should he give to charity to maximize 
the money he has after taxes and charitable giving?
$BR $BR
The count should give \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT to charity.
$BR $BR
If the count did receive a tax refund for giving more than $example2 $PERCENT 
of his income to charity, how much should he give to charity?
$BR $BR
The count should give \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT to charity.
