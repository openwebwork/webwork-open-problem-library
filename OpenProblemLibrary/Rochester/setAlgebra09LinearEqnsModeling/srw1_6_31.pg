TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The radiator in a car is filled with a solution of $antifr per cent
antifreeze and $water per cent water.  The manufacturer of the
antifreeze suggests that for summer driving, optimal cooling of the
engine is obtained with only 50 per cent antifreeze.  If the capacity
of the raditor is $cap liters, how much coolant (in liters) must be
drained and replaced with pure water to reduce the antifreeze
concentration to 50 per cent?
