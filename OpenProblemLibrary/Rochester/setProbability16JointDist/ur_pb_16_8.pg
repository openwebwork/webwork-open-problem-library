$one[$tag1]'s bowling scores are approximately normally distributed with mean \($m1\) and standard deviation \($d1,\) while $two[$tag2]'s
scores are normally distributed with mean \($m2\) and standard deviation \($d2.\) If $one[$tag1] and $two[$tag2] each bowl one game, then
assuming that their scores are independent random variables, approximate the probability that the total of their scores is above \($score.\)
