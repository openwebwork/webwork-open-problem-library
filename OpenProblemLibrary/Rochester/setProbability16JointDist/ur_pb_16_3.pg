A man and a woman agree to meet at a cafe about noon. If the man arrives at a time uniformly distributed between \(11:$a\)
and \(12:$b\) and if the woman independently arrives at a time uniformly distributed between \(11:$c\) and \(12:$d\), what
is the probability that the first to arrive waits no longer than \($m\) minutes?
