BEGIN_TEXT

Two points are selected randomly on a line of length \( $l \) so as to be on opposite sides of the midpoint of the line. In
other words, the two points \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent random variables such that \(X\) is uniformly distributed over
\( [0,$a) \) and \(Y\) is uniformly distributed over \( ($a,$l] \). Find the probability that the distance between the two
points is greater than \($b\).

answer: \{ans_rule(20)\}
