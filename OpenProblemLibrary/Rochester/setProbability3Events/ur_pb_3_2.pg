$PAR

Two fair dice are tossed, and the up face on each die is recorded. 
Find the probability of observing each of the following events: $PAR

\(A: $LEFT_BRACE \) $squest[0] \( $RIGHT_BRACE \) $BR

\(B: $LEFT_BRACE \) $squest[1] \( $RIGHT_BRACE \) $BR

\(C: $LEFT_BRACE \) $squest[2] \( $RIGHT_BRACE \) $PAR

\(P(A)= \) \{ans_rule(5)\} 
\( \ \ \ \ \ P(B)= \) \{ans_rule(5)\} 
\( \ \ \ \ \ P(C)= \) \{ans_rule(5)\}
