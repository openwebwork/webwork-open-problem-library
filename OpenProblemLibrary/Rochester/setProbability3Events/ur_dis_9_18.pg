BEGIN_TEXT
A five-card poker hand is dealt at random from a standard 52-card deck. 
$BR Note the total number of possible hands is C(52,5)=2,598,960. $BR
Find the probabilities of the following scenarios: $BR
(a) What is the probability that the hand contains exactly one ace? $BR 
Answer=\( \frac{\alpha}{C(52,5)}, \) where \( \alpha= \) \{ ans_rule(30)
\}
$PAR
(b) What is the probability that the hand is a flush? (That is all the
cards are
of the same suit: hearts, clubs, spades or diamonds.) $BR
Answer=\( \frac{\beta}{C(52,5)}, \) where \( \beta= \) 
\{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
(c) What is the probability that the hand is a straight flush? $BR
Answer=\( \frac{\gamma}{C(52,5)}, \) where \( \gamma= \) 
\{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
