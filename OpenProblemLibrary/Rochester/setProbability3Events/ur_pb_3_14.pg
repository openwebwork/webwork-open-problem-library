An instructor gives his class a set of $n problems with the information that the next quiz will consist of a random
selection of $k of them. If a student has figured out how to do $m of the problems, what is the probability the he or she
will answer correctly $BR

(a) all $k problems? \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

(b) at least $l problems? \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
