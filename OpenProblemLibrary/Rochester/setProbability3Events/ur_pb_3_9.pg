The number \( $n \) is written as a sum of three natural numbers 
\[ $n = a + b + c\]
(the triple \( (a,b,c) \) is ordered; e.g., the decompositions \( $n = 1 + 1 + $m \) and 
 \( $n = 1 + $m + 1 \) are different.$BR
Also, assume that all the decompositions have equal probability.) $BR

What is the probability that there exists a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)? \( \ \)
