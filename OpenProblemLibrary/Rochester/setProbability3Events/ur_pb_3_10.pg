BEGIN_TEXT
In a study by the Department of Transportation, there were a total of $a drivers that were pulled over
for speeding.  Out of those $a drivers, $b were men who were ticketed, $c were
men who were not ticketed, $d were women who were ticketed, and $e were women who
were not ticketed.  Suppose one person was chosen at random.
