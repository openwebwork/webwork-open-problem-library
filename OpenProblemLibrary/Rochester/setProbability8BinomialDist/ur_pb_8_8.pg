A man claims to have extrasensory perception (ESP). As a test, a fair coin is flipped \($n\) times, and the man is asked to predict the outcome in
advance. He gets \($k\) out of \($n\) correct. What is the probability that he would have done at least this well if he had no ESP? $BR

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Let \(X\) be the random variable that gives the number of correct guesses the ma
n would make without ESP.  Then \(X\) is a binomial random variable with paramet
ers \( n = $n\) and \(p = 0.5\) (since that is the probability of successfully g
uessing whether a fair coin will land on heads or tails.  Hence the probability 
he would do at least as well without ESP is
\[ P( X\geq $k ) = \sum_{i=$k}^{$n} {$n \choose i}(0.5)^{i}(0.5)^{n-i} = (0.5)^{
$n} \sum_{i=$k}^{$n} {$n \choose i}  \approx  $ans4dec.\]
