$BR

The Census Bureau reports that 82$PERCENT of Americans over the age of 25 are high school graduates.
A survey of randomly selected residents of certain county included $n who were over the age of 25, 
and $s of them were high school graduates. $BR

(a) \( \) Find the mean and standard deviation for the number of high school graduates in groups of $n Americans over the age of 25. $BR

Mean = \{ans_rule(15)\} $BR

Standard deviation = \{ans_rule(15)\} $BR

(b) \( \) Is that county result of $s unusually high, or low, or neither? $BR

(Enter HIGH or LOW or NEITHER) \{ans_rule(15)\}
