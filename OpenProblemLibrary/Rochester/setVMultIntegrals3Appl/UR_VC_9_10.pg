BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
You are getting married and your dearest relative has baked you a cake which
fills the volume between the two planes, \( z=0 \) and \( z=${a}x + ${b}y + c
\), and inside the cylinder \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).  You are to cut it in half by
making two vertical slices from the center outward.  Suppose one of the slices
is at \( \theta = 0 \) and the other is at \( \theta = \psi \).
$PAR
What is the limit, \( \displaystyle \lim_{c \rightarrow \infty} \psi \)?
