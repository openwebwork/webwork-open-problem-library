Suppose the Total Sum of Squares for a completely randomzied design with \(p = $p\) treatments and \(n =
$n\) total measurements (SS(Total))is equal to \($ss\).  In each of the following cases, conduct an
\(F\) -test of the null hypothesis that the mean responses for the \($p\) treatments are the same.  Use
\(\alpha = $alpha[0]\). $BR
(a) Sum of Squares for Treatment (SST) is \($sperc[0]\)$PERCENT of SS(Total) $PAR
