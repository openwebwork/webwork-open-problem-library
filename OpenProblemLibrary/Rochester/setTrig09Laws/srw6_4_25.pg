TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The path of a satellite orbiting the earth causes it to pass directly over 
two tracking stations A and B, which are $c miles apart. When the satellite 
is on one  side of the two stations, the angles of elevation at A and B are 
measured to be 87 degrees and 84 degrees, respectively, see the graph
