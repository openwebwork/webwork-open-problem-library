# array 'one' is for choosing sin or cos as the first trig func value;
# the reason, the sin is repeated twice:
# when i have chosen sin or cos using $choice_one, i needed to
# refer to the one that was not chosen. i did it by
# referring to it as $one[$choice_one+1]. for this
# i needed to have another sin after the cos.
