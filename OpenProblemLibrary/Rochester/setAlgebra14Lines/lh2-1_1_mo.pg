#  Setup

# Define the graph

# Here are the basic colors
@colors = ("blue", "red", "green");
# Slice will contain the numbers 1,2,3 in some permuted order
@slice = NchooseK(3,3);
# The slice of the color list (sc) contains the colors in a new order defined by the ordering in @slice.
# This construction @array[@slice] is the way to apply a permutation to a list.
@sc = @colors[@slice];  #scrambled colors

# Now we scramble the letters labeling the graphs using the same permutation.
# These list will contain the correct answers in the proper order.

# Now that we have permuted colors in @sc and permuted letters in @sa we are ready to define the function.

# So $fpRef->rule points to the method which will calculate the value of the function.

# create labels for each function
