The geometric series can be used to approximate the reciprocal of a 
number by using a nearby number whose reciprocal is known.  For example,
\( \displaystyle \frac1{24} = \frac1{25}\frac1{1-\frac1{25}} \) = $BR
\( \displaystyle \frac1{25} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac1{25} \right) ^n \) $BR
leads to the approximation 
\( \displaystyle \frac1{25}\left(1 + \frac{1}{25}\right) \) of \(\displaystyle \frac1{24}\) by truncating
the series.$BR
This approximation to \( \displaystyle \frac{1}{24}\)  is easily expressed as a decimal: 
\( .04(1+.04) = .0416. \)$BR

Use the fact that $p is near 100 to get a similar four place decimal approximation of 
\(\displaystyle \frac1{$p}.\)$BR

The error in  approximating a number A by a  number a is e = a-A. The
relative error is e/A.  The relative percent error is 100e/A. $BR
Find
the relative percent error in the approximation of \( \frac{1}{$p}\) described above. $BR
