This problem demonstrates WeBWorK procedures for grading 
multipart problems.  This problem will be graded by an ad hoc grading procedure written 
in the code of the problem.
In this three part question, the procedure gives 50 per cent of the weight to part 1 and 25 
per cent to parts 2 and 3.  It also outputs a message to the student telling them how the 
problem will be graded.
