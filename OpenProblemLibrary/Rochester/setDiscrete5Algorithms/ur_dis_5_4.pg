BEGIN_TEXT
You are the head of a division of a big Silicon Valley company and have
assigned one of your engineers, Jim, the job of devising an algorithm to
sort through an English text of \(n\) words and convert it into an
Esperanto document.  Jim comes up with an algorithm which takes
\(2n^2+2^n\) bit operations to handle an input text with n words.  Suppose the
computers in your business can handle one bit operation every nanosecond (\(1\)
nanosecond \(= 10^{-9}\) seconds).  $BR
(a) How many nanoseconds would it take Jim's algorithm to convert a text with \($a\)
words on these computers? $BR 
\{ans_rule(15)\} $BR
(b) How many HOURS would it take Jim's algorithm to convert a text with \($b\) words on
these computers?( Do not round your answers for WeBWorK.) \{ans_rule(15)\}$PAR
