BEGIN_TEXT
Now reverse this formula and given the expanded version find the version with just one term.
This involves solving a pair of equations -- $BR
in order to get \( A\cos(x) + B\sin(x) = R\sin(x+b) = R\sin(b)\cos(x)  + R\cos(b)\sin(x)    \)
what values must you choose for \( R \) and \( b \)? (Match coefficients.)
$BR
$PAR By convention we'll assume that the
amplitude (the first coefficient on the left hand side) is positive.
$PAR
 \{ans_rule(7)\}\(\cos(${a} x + \) \{ans_rule(7)\}\(  ) = \) \(${A}\cos(${a}x)\) + \(${B} \sin(${a}x ) \)
$PAR
 \{ans_rule(7)\}\(\sin(${c} x + \) \{ans_rule(7)\} \( ) = \) \(${C}\cos(${c}x)\) + \(${D} \sin(${c}x ) \)
$PAR

The upshot of this exercise is that we can always rewrite the sum of  multiples of  sin() and  cos() as a single
sin() function with a given amplitude and phase shift. We could also write it as a single cos(), but it would have a different
phase in that case.  We'll use this many times in interpreting results.
