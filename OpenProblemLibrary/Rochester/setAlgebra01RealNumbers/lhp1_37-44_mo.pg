#  Setup

Context("ABCD")->strings->add(E=>{},e=>{alias=>"E"}); # now we have ABCDE

# Make a new match list
$ml = new_match_list();
$a = random(1,30);
$b = random(1,31);

# enter questions and matching answers
$ml->qa (
"All \( x \) in the interval \( (-$a,$b)\)" => "\( -$a<x<$b \)",
"All \( x \) in the interval \( (-$a,$b]\)" => "\( -$a<x\leq $b \)",
"All \( x \) in the interval \( [-$a,$b)\)" => "\( -$a\leq x<$b \)",
"All \( x \) in the interval \( [-$a,$b]\)" => "\( -$a\leq x\leq $b\)",
"\( x \) is no more than \($b\)" => "\( x\leq $b \)",
"\( x \) is greater than \(-$a\)" => "\( -$a<x \)",
"\( x\) is nonnegative" => "\( x\geq0\)"
);

# Choose four of the question and answer pairs at random.
$ml->choose(4);

#
#  Text

# Now print the text using $ml->print_q for
# the questions and $ml->print_a to print the answers.

BEGIN_TEXT
This exercise is concerned with operations with inequality and interval notations. $BR
Match the sets and the inequalities by placing the letter of the inequality next to each set listed below: $BR
\{ $ml -> print_q \}
$PAR
\{ $ml -> print_a \}
