# which parts of the matching question have been answered correctly.
# Do not show partial correct answers
$showPartialCorrectAnswers = 0;

# Make a new match list
$ml = new_match_list();

# Choose four of the question and answer pairs at random.
$ml ->choose(5); 
# Using choose(7) would choose all eight questions,
# but the ord6r of the questions and answers would be
# scrambled.

# Now print the text using $ml->print_q for
# the questions and $ml->print_a to print the answers.

BEGIN_TEXT

This exercise concerns with operations with inequality and interval notations. $BR
Match the sets and the inequalities by Placing the letter of the inequality next to each set listed below: $BR
\{ $ml -> print_q \}
$PAR
\{$ml -> print_a \}
