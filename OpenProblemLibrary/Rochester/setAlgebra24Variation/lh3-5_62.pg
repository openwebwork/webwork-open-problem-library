BEGIN_TEXT

A company has found that the demand for its product varies inversely as the price of the product. When the price \(x\) is \($a\) dollars, the demand \(y\) is \($b\) units. Find a mathematical model that gives the demand \(y\) in terms of the price \(x\) in dollars. $BR
Your answer is \(y=\)\{ans_rule(30)\}

Approximate the demand when the price is \($c\) dollars.
$BR
Your answer is: \{ans_rule(20)\}
$BR
END_TEXT
