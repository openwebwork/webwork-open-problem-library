The stopping distance \(d\) of an automobile is directly proportional to the square of its speed \(v\). A car required \($a\) feet to stop when its speed was \($b\) miles per hour. Find a mathematical model that gives the stopping distance \(d\) in terms of its speed \(v\). $BR
Your answer is \(d=\)\{ans_rule(30)\}

Estimate the stopping distance if the brakes are applied when the car is traveling at \($c\) miles per hour.
$BR
Your answer is: \{ans_rule(20)\}
