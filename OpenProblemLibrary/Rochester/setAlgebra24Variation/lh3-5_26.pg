BEGIN_TEXT

State sales tax \(y\) is directly proportional to retail price \(x\). An item that sells for \($a\) dollars has a sales
tax of \($b\) dollars. Find a mathematical model that gives the amount of sales tax \(y\) in terms of the retail price
\(x\). 
$BR
Your answer is \(y=\)\{ans_rule(30)\}
$BR 
What is the sales tax on a \($c\) dollars purchase.
