BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose you have just poured a cup of freshly brewed coffee with temperature \($temp0^{\circ} C\) in a room where the
temperature is \($room^{\circ} C\). 
$BR
Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the temperature difference between
the object and its surroundings. Therefore, the temperature of the coffee, \(T(t)\), satisfies the differential equation 
\[ \frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-T_{\rm room}) \]
where \(T_{\rm room}=$room\) is the room temperature, and \(k\) is some constant. 
$BR
Suppose it is known that the coffee cools at a rate of \($rate_per_minute^{\circ} C\) per minute when its temperature is
\( $room_plus_diff^{\circ} C\).  
$BR
$BR
A. What is the limiting value of the temperature of the coffee? 
$BR
\( \displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} T(t) = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
B. What is the limiting value of the rate of cooling? 
$BR
\( \displaystyle \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{dT}{dt} = \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
$BR
C. Find the constant \(k\) in the differential equation. 
$BR 
\(k=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}. 
$BR
$BR
D. Use Euler's method with step size \(h=$step\) minutes to estimate the temperature of the coffee after \($time\)
minutes. $BR
\(T($time)=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}.
