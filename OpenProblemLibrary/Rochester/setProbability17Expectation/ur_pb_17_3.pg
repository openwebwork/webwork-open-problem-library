BEGIN_TEXT

Consider \(n=$n\) independent flips of a fair coin. Say that a changeover
occurs whenever an 
outcome differs from the one preceding it. For
example, if \(n=6\) and the outcome is \( T \ H \ T \ T \ H \ T, \) 
then there is a total 
of 4 changeovers. Find the expected number of
changeovers for  \( n=$n\).
