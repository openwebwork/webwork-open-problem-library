BEGIN_TEXT

\( $n \) people arrive separately to a professional dinner. Upon arrival, each person looks to see if he or she has any friends among those
present. That person then either sits at the table of a friend or at an unoccupied table is none of those present is a friend. Assuming that each
of the \( {$n}\choose{2} \) pairs of people are, independently, friends with probability \($p,\) find the expected number of occupied tables. 
$PAR
(Hint: One possible approach is to define, for example, \(X_3\) to be the random variable whose value is 1 if the third person to arrive sits at an unoccupied table and 0 otherwise.)
$PAR
Answer:  The expected number of occupied tables is \{ans_rule(30)\}

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
For \(1\leq i \leq $n\), let \(X_i\) be the random variable whose value is 1 if the \(i\)th person to arrive sits at a previously unoccupied table and 0 otherwise.  The first person to arrive definitely sits at an unoccupied table, so \(X_1 =1\) with probability 1.  For \(i>1\), note that \(P(X_i=1)\) is the probability that the \(i\)th person to arrive is not friends with any of the \(i-1\) people already there.  Thus, by independence of the pairwise friendships, \(P(X_i = 1) = ($q)^{i-1}\), so 
\[E[X_i] = 0\cdot  (1-($q)^{i-1}) + 1\cdot ($q)^{i-1} = ($q)^{i-1}.\]
Note:  \(X_i\) is in fact a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \(($q)^{i-1}\).
$PAR

Now, let \(X = \sum_{i=1}^{$n} X_i\).  Then the value of \(X\) is equal to the total number of guests who sit at unoccupied tables upon arrival at the dinner, and this is equal to the total number of occupied tables at the dinner.  Hence we are looking for \(E[X]\).
\[ \begin{aligned}
E[X] & = E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{$n} X_i\right]  = \sum_{i=1}^{$n}E[X_i] \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^{$n} ($q)^{i-1} = 1 + ($q) + ($q)^2 + \cdots + ($q)^{$nsub1} \\
& = \frac{1-($q)^{$n}}{1-$q} = \frac{1-($q)^{$n}}{$p}.
\end{aligned} \]
