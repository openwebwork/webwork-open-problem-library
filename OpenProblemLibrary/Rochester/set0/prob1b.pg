BEGIN_TEXT
This problem will help you learn the rules of precedence, i.e. the order in which
mathematical operations are performed. You can use parentheses (and also square brackets
[ ] and/or curly braces $LB $RB) if you want to change the normal way operations work.$PAR

So first let us review the normal way operations are performed.$PAR

The rules are simple.  Exponentiation is always done before multiplication 
and division and multiplication and division are always done before addition 
and subtraction. (Mathematically we say exponentiation takes precedence over 
multiplication and division, etc.). For example what is 1+2*3? $BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = 7;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));


BEGIN_TEXT
$BR and what is \( 2\cdot 3^2 \)? $BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = 2*3**2;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT

$BR
Now sometime you want to force things to be done in a different way. This is
what parentheses are used for.  The rule is: whatever is enclosed in 
parentheses is done before anything else (and things in the inner most
parentheses are done first). 

For example how do you enter \[ \frac {1+\sin(3)}{2+\tan(4)}\quad ? \] Hint: this is a good place to use
[ ]'s and also to use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button. $BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = (1+sin(3))/(2+tan(4)) ;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR
Here are some more examples:

(1+3)9 =36, (2*3)**2 = 6**2 = 36, 3**(2*2) = 3**4 = 81, (2+3)**2 = 5**2 = 25, 3**(2+2) = 3**4 = 81

$BR
(Here we have used ** to denote exponentiation and you can also use this instead of a ${LQ}caret${RQ} if you want).  Try entering some of these and use the "Preview" button to see the result.  The "correct"
result for this answer blank is 36, but by using the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button, you can enter whatever 
you want and use WeBWorK as a hand calculator.$BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}

END_TEXT

$ans =36;

ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

There is one other thing to be careful of.  Multiplication and division have the 
same precedence and there are no universal rules as to which should be done first.
For example, what does 2/3*4 mean?  (Note that / is the "division symbol", which 
is usually written as a line with two dots, but unfortunately, this "line with
two dots" symbol is not on computer keyboards. Don't think of / as the horizontal
line in a fraction. Ask yourself what 1/2/2 should mean.) WeBWorK and most other
computers read things from left to right, i.e. 2/3*4 means (2/3)*4 or 8/3, IT DOES 
NOT MEAN 2/12.  Some computers may do operations from right to left.  If you 
want 2/(3*4) = 2/12, you have to use parentheses.  The same thing happens with
addition and subtraction. 1-3+2 = 0 but 1-(3+2) = -4. This is one case where using
parentheses even if they are not needed might be a good idea, e.g. write (2/3)*4
even though you could write 2/3*4. This is also a case where previewing your answer
can save you a lot a grief since you will be able to see what you entered. 

$BR
Enter 2/3*4 and use the Preview button to see what you get.$BR
\{ ans_rule(25) \}
END_TEXT

$ans = 8/3;
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
