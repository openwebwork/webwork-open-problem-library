This problem demonstrates a WebWork Matching question. $PAR Match the
statements defined below with the letters labeling their equivalent
expressions. $BR You must get all of the answers correct to receive
credit.  $BR

ANS(str_cmp([ @ALPHABET[&invert(@shuffle)] ] ) );
     ##the correct answers are obtained by applying
     ##the inverse (adjoint) permutation to the captions.

TEXT(<<EOT);

For this problem WebWork only tells you that all your answers are
correct or that at least one is wrong.  This makes the problem harder
and is usually used only for T/F and matching questions.  The idea is
to encourage you to think rather than to just try guessing.  $PAR If
you are having trouble reading the mathematics on the screen, this
means that you are using ${LQ}text${RQ} mode.  If you are using
Netscape or MSIE then you can get an easier to read version of the
equations by returning to the problem list page (use the button at the
top of this page) and choosing ${LQ}formatted-text${RQ} or
${LQ}typeset${LQ} instead of ${LQ}text${RQ}. Sometimes there is a
15-20 second delay in viewing a problem in ${LQ}typeset${RQ} mode the
first time.
