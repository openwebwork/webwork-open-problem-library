BEGIN_TEXT
This problem demonstrates how you enter numerical answers into WeBWorK. $PAR
Evaluate the expression \(3($a )($b -$c -2($d ))\):
 \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR

END_TEXT

$ans = 3*($a)*($b-$c-2*($d));

ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>"strict"));


BEGIN_TEXT

In the case above you need to enter a number, since we're testing
whether you can multiply out these numbers. (You can use a calculator
if you want.)  $PAR For most problems, you will be able to get WeBWorK
to do some of the work for you.  For example
$BR
Calculate ($a) * ($b): \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

END_TEXT


$ans = $a*$b;

ANS(num_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT

The asterisk * is what most computers use to denote multiplication and
you can use this with WeBWorK.  But WeBWorK will also allow you to use
a space to denote multiplication.  You can either \($a * $b\) or
\{$a*$b\} or even \($a \ $b\).  All will work. Try them.

$PAR

Now try calculating the sine of 45 degrees ( that's sine of pi over 4
in radians and numerically sin(pi/4) equals \{1/sqrt(2)\} or, more
precisely, \(1/\sqrt{2} \) ).  You can enter this as sin(pi/4), as
sin(3.1415926/4), as 1/sqrt(2), as 2**(-.5), etc. This is because
WeBWorK knows about functions like sin and sqrt (square root).
Exponents can be indicated either by a caret ${CARET} or by two
asterisks **. Try it.$BR \( \sin(\pi/4) = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR

Here's the \{
htmlLink(qq!http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Available_Functions!,"list
of the functions") \} which WeBWorK understands.  WeBWorK ALWAYS uses
radian mode for trig functions.

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp(sin(pi/4)));

BEGIN_TEXT

You can also use juxtaposition to denote multiplication. For example,
enter \( 2\sin(3\pi/2) \).  You can enter this as 2*sin(3*pi/2) or
more simply as 2sin(3pi/2).  Try it: $BR \{ ans_rule(20) \}$PAR

END_TEXT


ANS(num_cmp(2*sin(3*pi/2)));

BEGIN_TEXT

Sometimes you need to use ( )'s to make your meaning clear. For
example, 1/2+3 is 3.5, but 1/(2+3) is 0.2 Why?  Try entering both and
use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ} button below to see the difference.  In
addition to ( )'s, you can also use [ ]'s and ${MYEMPTYSET}'s.  $BR 

\{ans_rule(20)\}

$PAR

END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp(.2));

BEGIN_TEXT

You can always try to enter answers and let WeBWorK do the
calculating.  WeBWorK will tell you if the problem requires a strict
numerical answer.  There is no penalty for getting an answer wrong,
and you may attempt a problem as many times as you want before the due
date.  For complicated answers, you should use the ${LQ}Preview${RQ}
button to check for syntax errors and also to check that the answer
you enter is really what you think it is.
