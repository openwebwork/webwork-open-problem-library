TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
This problem demonstrates a WeBWorK Matching question. $PAR
Match the statements defined below with the letters labeling their
equivalent expressions.	$BR
You must get all of the answers correct to receive credit.

TEXT(
&match_questions_list(@questions[@slice]),
&OL(@answers[@slice[@shuffle]])

ANS(str_cmp([ @ALPHABET[&invert(@shuffle)] ] ) );
     ##the correct answers are obtained by applying
     ##the inverse (adjoint) permutation to the captions.

TEXT(<<EOT);
For this problem WeBWorK only tells you that all your answers are correct or that at least one is wrong. 
This makes the problem harder and is usually used only for T/F and matching questions.  
The idea is to encourage you to think rather than to just try guessing.
$PAR
If you are having trouble reading the mathematics on the screen, this means that you are using "text" mode.  
If you are using Netscape or MSIE then you can get an easier to read version of the equations by returning to the 
problem list page (use the button at the top of this page) and choosing "formatted-text" or "typeset" instead 
of "text". Sometimes there is a 15-20 second delay in viewing a problem in "typeset" mode the first time.
