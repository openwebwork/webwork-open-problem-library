BEGIN_TEXT

This problem demonstrates how you enter function answers into
WebWork. $PAR First enter the function \(\sin\; x\). When entering the
function, you should enter sin(x), but WebWork will also accept sin x
or even sinx. If you remember your trig identities, sin(x) =
-cos(x+pi/2) and WebWork will accept this or any other function equal
to sin(x), for example, sin(x) + sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 - 1 (or sin(x)
+ sin${CARET}2(x) + cos${CARET}2(x) - 1) $BR\{ans_rule(35) \}

END_TEXT

$ans = "sin(x)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR We said you should enter sin(x) even though WebWork will also
accept sin x or even sinx because you are less likely to make a
mistake.  Try entering sin(2x) without the parentheses and you may be
surprised at what you get. Use the Preview button to see what you get.
WebWork will evaluate functions (such as sin) before doing anything
else, so sin 2x means first apply sine, which gives sin(2), and then
mutiply by x.  Try it.  $BR\{ans_rule(35) \}

END_TEXT


$ans = "sin(2*x)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR Now enter the function \(2\cos t\).  Note this is a function of
\(t\) and not \(x\). Try entering 2cos x and see what happens.  $BR
\{ans_rule(35) \}

END_TEXT

$ans = "2*cos(t)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans, vars=>'t'));
