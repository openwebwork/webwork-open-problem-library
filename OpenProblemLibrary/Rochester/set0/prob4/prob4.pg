##DESCRIPTION
##  Goal: Identify that a line represents an increasing, decreasing or constant function
##  or is not the graph of a function (when the line is vertical).

 qq! This problem demonstrates a WeBWorK problem involving graphics. $PAR
 The simplest functions are the linear (or affine) functions ---
  the functions whose graphs are 
 a straight line. They are important because many functions (the so-called
 differentiable functions) ${LQ}locally$RQ look like straight lines.
  (${LQ}locally$RQ means that 
 if we zoom in and look at the function at very powerful magnification 
 it will look like a straight line.)  $PAR

This is another problem where you aren't told if some of your answers are right. (With
matching questions and true false questions, this is the standard behavior -- otherwise
it is too easy to guess your way to the answer without learning anything.)
