This problem demonstrates a WebWork question that requires you to
enter a number or a fraction. $PAR Evaluate the expression
\(\frac{|$a-$b|}{|$c|}\).  Give your answer in decimal notation
correct to three decimal places or give your answer as a fraction.
$BR $BR \{ANS_RULE(1,10) \} $BR

END_TEXT

$ans = abs($a-$b)/abs($c);
ANS(num_cmp($ans, mode=>"arith"));

$PAR

Now that you have finished you can use the ${LQ}Prob. List${RQ} button
at the top of the page to return to the problem list page.  You'll see
that the problems you have done have been labeled as correct or
incorrect, so you can go back and do problems you skipped or couldn't
get right the first time.  Once you have done a problem correctly it
is always listed as correct even if you go back and do it incorrectly
later.  This means you can use WebWork to review course material
without any danger of changing your grade.
