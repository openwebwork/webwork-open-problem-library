BEGIN_TEXT
This problem demonstrates how you enter function answers into WeBWorK. $PAR
First enter the function \(\sin\; x\). When entering the function, you should enter
sin(x), but WeBWorK will also accept sin x or even sinx. If you remember your trig 
identities, sin(x) = -cos(x+pi/2) and WeBWorK will accept this or any other function 
equal to sin(x), 
e.g. sin(x) +sin(x)**2+cos(x)**2-1
$BR\{ans_rule(35) \}

END_TEXT

$ans = "sin(x)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans));

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR
We said you should enter sin(x) even though WeBWorK will also accept sin x or even sinx because you
are less likely to make a mistake.  Try entering sin(2x) without the parentheses and you may be surprised
at what you get. Use the Preview button to see what you get.  WeBWorK will evaluate functions (such
as sin) before doing anything else, so sin 2x means first apply sin which gives sin(2) and then
mutiple by x.  Try it.
$BR\{ans_rule(35) \}

END_TEXT


$ans = "sin(2*x)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$PAR Now enter the function \(2\cos t\).  Note this is a function of \( t\) and not \( x\). Try entering
2cos x and see what happens. 
$BR \{ans_rule(35) \}
EOT

$ans = "2*cos(t)";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans, vars=>'t'));
