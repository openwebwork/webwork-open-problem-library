Readme file for using modifying and using the TA evaluation form

1. You can use the files in this subdirectory as samples when writing your own 
questionnaires.

2. TA_evaluation_spring06.pg is a standard pg problem file except that answers 
are emailed to the desinated email address(es).

3. If you want to use this sample .pg problem with minimal changes

    a) You should modify the list of courses and TA's on lines 55-65, 80-160, 
    and 164-240. Note that the TA's are listed as 1,2,3, ... but the $TA_buttons 
    array is indexed 0,1,2, ... so that e.g. Lauren Burr (TA number 1) 
    corresponds to $TA_buttons[0]. This means you have to be careful where you 
    put in the course names on lines 164-240.
    
    b) Modify lines 394 ... entering correct email address(es) and subject line 
    for the email. The student responses will be emailed to these address(es).

4. You also have to modify the following section of the file global.conf which 
you will find in the directory .../webwork2/conf/

# AllowedRecipients defines addresses that the PG system is allowed to send mail
# to. this prevents subtle PG exploits. This should be set in course.conf to the
# addresses of professors of each course. Sending mail from the PG system (i.e.
# questionaires, essay questions) will fail if this is not set somewhere (either
# here or in course.conf).
$mail{allowedRecipients}     = [
	#'prof1@yourserver.yourdomain.edu',
	#'prof2@yourserver.yourdomain.edu',
	'apizer@math.rochester.edu',
	'gage@math.rochester.edu',
];
to enable email.

You can also do this directly from the web by using "Course Configuration". 
Select "E-mail" and edit the section  "E-mail addresses which can recieve e-mail 
from a pg problem". However, if you do it this way, you will have do this for 
every course individually.

5. The script compile_TA_results_spring06.pl compiles the results and produces 5 
files.  This script will have to be modified (see item 8 below).



 The required inputs to the script compile_TA_results_spring06.pl are the html 
 source of the questionnaire, a file containing all the email responses 
 concatenated into one file, and a base file name [e.g. spring06_TA_results] 
 (without an extension) for the five output files. The five output files will be 
 e.g. spring06_TA_results_summary.html, spring06_TA_results_short.html, 
 spring06_TA_results.html, spring06_TA_results.xls, and spring06_TA_results.txt.

 spring06_TA_results_summary.html is a small file containing a summary of the 
 sponses of question 5 which is the overall evaluation and for question C 
 "Would you take a recitation with this TA again?"

 spring06_TA_results_short.html is a file containing the responses to question 
 5 (overall evaluation) and question C ("Would you take a recitation with this 
 TA again?") along with all student written comments.  The comments are 
 ordered in the approximate order of from better to worst.

 spring06_TA_results.html is a large file containing detailed information on 
 each TA along with all student written comments. The comments are ordered in 
 the approximate order of from better to worst.

 TA_evalation_fall02.xls is a large file suitable for importation to a 
 spreadsheet program such as Excel. It contains all numerical data.

 TA_evalation_fall02.txt is a large file suitable for importation to a 
 spreadsheet program such as Excel. It contains all written comments.  The 
 numerical and written data are keyed to each other. 
 

 6. The required html source of the questionnaire (not the .pg file 
 TA_evaluation_fall02.pg!) can be easily obtained by viewing the questionnaire 
 in a browser and saving the html source (e.g. in FireFox use "View" and select 
 "Page Source").
 
 
 7. The file containing all the email responses can be obtained by selecting all 
 the responses in your email client and saving them to a file. E.g. in Eudora, 
 select all the responses then use "save as" under the File drop down menu. 
 Obviously, it is convenient to use a filter to direct all the responses to a 
 single mailbox.

 8. IMPORTANT:  the script compile_TA_results_spring06.pl uses the html source 
 of the questionnaire to obtain data and formatting information.  If you modify 
 the structure of the questionnaire (by modifying the .pg file 
 TA_evaluation_spring06.pg), you may have to modify 
 compile_TA_results_spring06.pl as well.  Check the following:
 a. $semester in line 58
 b. lines 108-133.  This is where the data (course names, TA names and 
    recitation times) is obtained from the html source of the questionnaire. If 
    you change the questionnaire, the format of this data may change and you may 
    have to modify the code accordingly.
 c. lines 153-158.  Your email client, spam filter, etc. may add extraneous 
    lines to the email you recieve. If so, you may have to edit these lines so 
    that these extraneous lines are skipped.

 9.  Run the script by issuing the following command from a directory that 
   contains the script and required input files.
   
   perl ./compile_TA_results_spring06.pl
   
   This will prompt you for the required inputs.
