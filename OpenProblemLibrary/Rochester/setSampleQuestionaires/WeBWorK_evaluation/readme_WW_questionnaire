Readme file for using modifying and using the WeBWorK evaluation form 
WeBWorK_questionnaire_spring06.pg

1. You can use the files in this subdirectory as samples when writing your own 
questionnaires.

2. WeBWorK_questionnaire_spring06.pg is a standard pg problem file except that 
answers are emailed to the desinated email address(es).

3. If you want to use this sample with minimal changes

    a) You should modify the list of courses on lines 69 - 78.
    b) Modify lines 637-639 entering correct email addresses and subject line 
       for the email. Uncomment lines if you want to send the results to multiple 
       people.

4. You also have to modify the following section of the file global.conf which 
you will find in the directory .../webwork2/conf/

# AllowedRecipients defines addresses that the PG system is allowed to send mail
# to. this prevents subtle PG exploits. This should be set in course.conf to the
# addresses of professors of each course. Sending mail from the PG system (i.e.
# questionaires, essay questions) will fail if this is not set somewhere (either
# here or in course.conf).
$mail{allowedRecipients}     = [
	#'prof1@yourserver.yourdomain.edu',
	#'prof2@yourserver.yourdomain.edu',
	'apizer@math.rochester.edu',
	'gage@math.rochester.edu',
];
to enable email.

You can also do this directly from the web by using "Course Configuration". 
Select "E-mail" and edit the section  "E-mail addresses which can recieve e-mail 
from a pg problem". However, if you do it this way, you will have do this for 
every course individually.

5. The script compile_questionnaire_results_spring06.pl compiles the results and 
produces 4 files.

 The required inputs to the script compile_questionnaire_results_spring06.pl are 
 the html source of the questionnaire, a file containing all the email responses 
 concatenated into one file, and a base file name [e.g. spring06_WW_evaluation] 
 (without an extension) for the four output files. The four output files will be 
 e.g. spring06_WW_evaluation_full.html, spring06_WW_evaluation_numeric.html, 
 spring06_WW_evaluation.txt and spring06_WW_evaluation.xls.

 spring06_WW_evaluation_full.html contains the full data including all student 
 comments --- this is the most interesting page to look at.

 spring06_WW_evaluation_numeric.html is a subset of 
 spring06_WW_evaluation_full.html containing only the numeric data.

 spring06_WW_evaluation.txt and spring06_WW_evaluation.xls are files containing 
 the student comments and numerical data in a form that can be analyzed to your 
 heart's content in any spreadsheet program.


 6. The required html source of the questionnaire (not the .pg file WeBWorK_questionnaire_spring06.pg!)
 can be easily obtained by viewing the questionnaire 
 in a browser and saving the html source (e.g. in FireFox use "View" and select 
 "Page Source").
 
 7. The file containing all the email responses can be obtained by selecting all 
 the responses in your email client and saving them to a file. E.g. in Eudora, 
 select all the responses then use "save as" under the File drop down menu. 
 Obviously, it is convenient to use a filter to direct all the responses to a 
 single mailbox.
 
 8. IMPORTANT:  the script compile_questionnaire_results_spring06.pl uses the html source of the questionnaire
 to create its output.  If you modify the structure of the questionnaire (by modifying the .pg file
 WeBWorK_questionnaire_spring06.pg), you may have to modify compile_questionnaire_results_spring06.pl as well.

 9. Run the script by issuing the following command from a directory that 
   contains the script and required input files.
   
   perl ./compile_questionnaire_results_spring06.pl
   
   This will prompt you for the required inputs.
