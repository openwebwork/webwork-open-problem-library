Physicians at a clinic gave what they thought were drugs to \($n\) asthma,
ulcer, and herpes patients.  Although the doctors later learned that the drugs
were really placebos, \($a\) $PERCENT of the patients reported an improved
condition.  Assume that if the placebo is ineffective, the probability of a
patients condition improving is \($p\).  For the hypotheses that the proportion
of improving is \($p\) against that it is \(>$p\), find the p-value.$PAR
\( p =\) \{ans_rule(10)\}
