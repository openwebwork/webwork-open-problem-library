BEGIN_TEXT
A sample of \($n\) measurements, randomly selected from a normally distributed
population, resulted in a sample mean, \(\overline{x} = $mean\) and sample
standard deviation \(s = $s\).  Using \(\alpha = $alpha \), test the null
hypothesis that the mean of the population is \($mu\) against the alternative
hypothesis that the mean of the population, \(\mu < $mu\) by giving the
following:$BR
(a) \( \ \) the degree of freedom \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR
(b) \( \ \) the critical \(t\) value \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\}$BR
(c) \( \ \) the test statistic \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
