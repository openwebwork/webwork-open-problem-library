Consider the exponential equation
\[1.1^x = 2\]
Let \(N\) and \(N+1\) be the two INTEGERS which bracket the
solution (ie. \(1.1^N<2\) and \(1.1^{N+1}>2\)). Then
$BR
\(N\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR

Now consider the exponential equation
\[1.1^y = 3\]
Let \(N\) and \(N+1\) be the two INTEGERS which bracket the
solution (ie. \(1.1^N<3\) and \(1.1^{N+1}>3\)). Then
$BR
\(N\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR

Using the integers \(N\) as approximations to the actual solutions
\(x\) and \(y\) of the exponential equations above we find that the
exponential equation
\[2^z =3\]
has approximate solution \(z\approx\frac{m}{n}\) where
$BR
\(m\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

and \(n\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR

To see how good an approximation \(\frac{m}{n}\) is to the actual
solution we compute
$BR
\(2^{\frac{m}{n}}\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
and check how close it is to 3.
$PAR

This problem illustrates John Napier's (1550-1617) approach to solving
exponential equations and how he came to discover natural logarithms.
Note that computing INTEGER powers of 1.1 can be done easily by hand,
as multiplication by 1.1 requires only shifting and adding.
