<P>
The following example illustrates Project 1 and furnishes
additional directions how to proceed.
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="problem.htm">Problem</A>
    <UL><LI>A WeBWorK problem assignment similar to Project 1 with correct
        answers submitted</UL>
<LI><A HREF="table1.htm">Table 1</A>
    <UL><LI>Table 1 of the spreadsheet for given given problem showing x
        values from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.1
        <LI>The x values and corresponding y=F(x) values asked for in
            WeBWorK are highlighted in red.
    </UL>
<LI><A HREF="table1f.htm">Table 1 Formulas</A>
    <UL><LI>The spreadsheet formulas used to calculate Table 1. Only the
            first two rows have to be entered by hand. The rest can be
            entered with the "Fill Down" command in the spreadsheet.
        <LI>To display formulas in the spreadsheet, rather than the numerical
            results of the formulas (as in Table 1 above) either use the
            following <A HREF="images/options.gif">Options dialog</A> or
            (in the Windows version of Excel) type Control-Backquote (`).
    </UL>
<LI><A HREF="table2.htm">Table 2</A>
    <UL><LI>Table 2 of the spreadsheet for given given problem showing x
        values from 0 to -10 in increments of -0.1
        <LI>The x values and corresponding y=F(x) values asked for in
            WeBWorK are highlighted in red.
        <LI>You can obtain this table by pasting the contents of Table 1
            into a new spreadsheet, then changing the value of the B1 cell
            from 0.1 to -0.1
    </UL>
<LI><A HREF="table2f.htm">Table 2 Formulas</A>
    <UL><LI>The spreadsheet formulas used to calculate Table 2.
    </UL>
<LI><A HREF="table31.htm">Table 3 - Step 1</A>
    <UL><LI>Table 3 is used to plot the graph of y=F(x) over the entire
            range from x=-10 to x=10
        <LI>The first step is to paste the contents of both Table 1 and
            Table 2 into Table 3. It is important to use the "Paste Special"
            menu command<BR>
            <IMG SRC="images/paspec0.gif"><BR>
            rather than the regular "Paste" command. Then check "Values"
            in the subsequent <A HREF="images/paspec.gif">Paste Special Dialog</A>.
        <LI>Note that we omitted the first row of Table 1 when pasting into
            Table 3. This is because the same first row occurs in Table 2.
     </UL>
<LI><A HREF="table32.htm">Table 3 - Step 2</A>
     <UL><LI>We now have deleted the middle columns from Table 3, leaving just
             the two outermost columns. The first column now contains x values
             and the second column contains y=F(x) values.
         <LI>If you get error messages after deleting the middle columns, this
             means you didn't use "Paste Special" in the previous step as instructed.
     </UL>
<LI><A HREF="table33.htm">Table 3 - Step 3</A>
     <UL><LI>We now have to sort Table 3 so that the x values in the first column
             are in increasing order. Highlight the entire table, then use the
             "Sort" menu command with the following <A HREF="images/sort.gif">sort options</A>.
     </UL>
<LI><A HREF="images/chart.gif">y=F(x) graph</A>
      <UL><LI>Now invoke the "Chart Wizzard" from the Toolbar using the following
              <A HREF="chartwiz.htm">options</A>
          <LI>You will then have a new spreadsheet with a chart showing the (approximate)
               graph of y=F(x). You can then fine tune the appearance of your graph by
               clicking on various areas of the graph (eg. the x or y axes) and setting
               various options at that point.
