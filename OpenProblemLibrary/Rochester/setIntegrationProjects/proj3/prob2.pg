Again referring to the diagram above (click on it for a better view)
we see that the distance that the hawk has flown in time \(t\)
is given by the integral \(\int_c^d F dx\) where
$BR
\(c\) = \{ ans_rule() \}
$BR
\(d\) = \{ ans_rule() \}
$BR
(Hints: Note that this integral computes the length of a curve. Also 
recall that the hawk's initial position is at \((a,0)=($a,0)\). )
$BR
and
$BR
\(F\) = \{ ans_rule() \}
$BR
(Use \(p\) to denote \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) in your last answer above.)

BEGIN_TEXT
On the other hand the hawk is flying at a constant speed of $w for time \(t\).
Hence the total distance it has flown is \{ ans_rule()\}. If we equate this
to the distance we just computed and solve for \(t\) we obtain
\[t = \int_c^d G dx\]
where \(G\) = \{ ans_rule() \}
$BR
(Remember to use \(p\) to represent \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).)
