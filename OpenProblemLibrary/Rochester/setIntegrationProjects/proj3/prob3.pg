BEGIN_TEXT
Equating the two expressions for \(t\) from Problems 1 and 2 we obtain the
integral equation
\[k(x,y,p) = \int_c^d G dx\]
To get rid of the integral, we differentiate both sides of the equation
with respect to \(x\). On the left hand side of the resulting equation
we obtain the following expression (which might involve \(x\), \(y\),
\(p=\frac{dy}{dx}\) and \(q=\frac{dp}{dx}=\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\)
$BR
\{ ans_rule() \}
$BR
(remember to separate different variables in a product with spaces or
multiplication signs)
$BR
while on the right hand side (after applying the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus) we obtain
$BR
\{ ans_rule() \}
$PAR

ANS(fun_cmp($ans1, vars=>["x","y","p","q"]));

$ans2 = "-sqrt(1+p^2)/$w";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans2, vars=>["x","y","p"]));


BEGIN_TEXT
The resulting differential equation we obtained above is a separable
differential equation in the variables \(p\) and \(x\). We can rewrite
it in the form
\[K(p)dp = L(x)dx\]
(with all numerical factors moved to the right hand side of the equation so
that L(1)=$v/$w.)
where
$BR
\(K(p)\) = \{ ans_rule() \}
$BR
\(L(x)\) = \{ ans_rule() \}
