TEXT(beginproblem());
BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that a hawk, whose initial position is \((a,0)=($a,0)\)
on the \(x\)-axis, spots a pigeon at \((0,$b)\) on the \(y\)-axis.
Suppose that the pigeon flies at a constant speed of $v ft/sec in
the direction of the \(y\)-axis (oblivious to the hawk), while
the hawk flies at a constant speed of $w ft/sec, always in the
direction of the pigeon.
$PAR

The problem is to find an equation for the flight path of the
hawk (the curve of pursuit) and to find the time and place where
the hawk will catch the pigeon. Assume that in this problem all
distances are measured in feet and all times measured in seconds.
Leave out all dimensions from your answers.

$PAR
Consider the diagram above (click on it for a better view)
which represents the situation at an arbitrary
time \(t\) during the pursuit. The points \(P\) and \(Q\) represent
the positions of the hawk and pigeon respectively at that time instant
\(t\), with \(y=f(x)\) representing the flight path of the hawk.


$PAR
The pigeon's position \(Q=(0,g(t))\) is given by the following function of time
$BR
\(g(t)\)  = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
END_TEXT

$ans1 = "$b+$v*t";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans1, vars=>"t"));

BEGIN_TEXT
The fact that the hawk is always headed in the direction of the pigeon
means that the line \(PQ\) is tangent to the pursuit curve \(y=f(x)\).
This tells us that \(\frac{dy}{dx}=h(x,y,t)\) where
$BR
\(h(x,y,t)\)   = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
(Your answer must involve the three variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\).)
$PAR
END_TEXT

$ans2 = "(y- $b- $v*t)/x";
ANS(fun_cmp($ans2, vars=>["x","y","t"]));

BEGIN_TEXT
If we solve the equation
\[p = h(x,y,t),\]
where \(p=\frac{dy}{dx}\), for time we obtain that \(t=k(x,y,p)\)
where
$BR
\(k(x,y,p)=\) = \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
(Your answer must involve the three variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(p\), where
\(p\) stands for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). )
