BEGIN_TEXT
There are a total of \( $T \) foreign language students in a high school where they offer
Spanish, French, and German.  There are \( $T2 \) students who take at least 2 languages at
once.  If there are \( $Ta \) Spanish students, \( $Tb \) French students, and \( $Tc \) German
students, how many students take all three languages at once?
$PAR
Answer: \{ans_rule(5)\}
