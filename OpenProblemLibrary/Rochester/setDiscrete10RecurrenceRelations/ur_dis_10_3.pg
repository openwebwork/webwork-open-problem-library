BEGIN_TEXT
We will find the solution to the following lhcc recurrence:$BR
\( a_{n} = $coeff1 a_{n-1} + $coeff2 a_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2 \) 
with initial conditions \( a_0 = $ic1 , a_1 = $ic2 \).

The first step in any problem like this is to find the characteristic 
equation by trying a solution of the "geometric" format \( a_n = r^n \).
(We assume also \( r \neq 0 \)). In this case we get:

\[ r^n = $coeff1 r^{n-1} + $coeff2 r^{n-2}. \]
Since we are assuming \( r \neq 0 \) we can divide by the smallest 
power of r, i.e., \( r^{n-2} \) to get the characteristic equation: 
\[ r^2 = $coeff1 r + $coeff2. \] 
(Notice since our lhcc recurrence was degree 2, the characteristic
equation is degree
2.) $BR

Find the two roots of the characteristic equation \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \). 
When entering your answers use \( r_1 \leq r_2 \): $BR
\( r_1 = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}, \( r_2 = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
$PAR

Since the roots are distinct, the general theory (Theorem 1 in section
5.2 of Rosen) tells us that the general solution to our lhcc recurrence
looks like:

\[ a_n = \alpha_1 (r_1)^n + \alpha_2 (r_2)^n \]
for suitable constants \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \). $BR

To find the values of these constants we have to use the initial 
conditions \( a_0 = $ic1, a_1 = $ic2 \). These yield by using 
n=0 and n=1 in the formula above:

\[ $ic1 = \alpha_1 (r_1)^0 + \alpha_2 (r_2)^0 \]
and
\[ $ic2 = \alpha_1 (r_1)^1 + \alpha_2 (r_2)^1 \]

By plugging in your previously found numerical values for \( r_1 \) 
and \( r_2 \) and doing some algebra, find \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \): $BR
[Be careful to note that \( (-x)^n \neq -(x^n) \) when n is even, 
for example \( (-3)^2 \neq -(3^2) \).] $BR

\( \alpha_1 = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} $BR
\( \alpha_2 = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
Note the final solution of the recurrence is:

\[ a_n = \alpha_1 (r_1)^n + \alpha_2 (r_2)^n \]
where the numbers \( r_i, \alpha_i \) have been found by your work.
This gives an explicit numerical formula in terms of n for the \( a_n \).
