BEGIN_TEXT
On a \( 8 \times 8 \) chessboard, the squares are colored alternately 
white and black. Thus there are \{ ans_rule(10) \} white squares 
and \{ ans_rule(10) \} black squares. Each row/column of the 
chessboard has \{ ans_rule(10) \} squares.
$BR
It is thus possible to tile this chessboard with dominoes (1 x 2 pieces) 
by laying say 4 dominoes per column. (tile means lay the dominoes, so that
they cover the chessboard, no two dominoes overlapping.)

BEGIN_TEXT
Now suppose we remove two squares from the chessboard, from DIAGONALLY 
opposite corners. Suppose one of the squares we remove is white. Now 
there are \{ ans_rule \} white squares left and \{ ans_rule \} 
black squares left.

"Q: Is it possible to cover the modified chessboard (with the two
diagonally
opposite corners removed) with dominoes? Why?",
"No. Since every time we lay down a domino it covers one white square and
one black square. Thus since the number of white squares is not equal to 
the number of black squares on the modified chessboard, it is
impossible."
);

$mc -> extra(
"No. Since the total 
number of remaining squares on the chessboard is odd and 
every domino covers 2 squares and hence can only be used to tile a
region with an even number of squares.",
"Yes. It is possible to tile the modified chessboard by placing dominoes, 
alternating between horizontal and vertical placements in a suitable
way.",
"Yes. Since there are an equal number of white and black squares remaining
on the modified chessboard, one can tile the modified chessboard with
dominoes each covering one white and one black square."
