$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD You can get full credit for this problem by just answering the
last question correctly. The initial questions are meant as hints towards
the final answer and also allow you the opportunity to get partial credit.
$PAR
Find the area bounded by the two curves:
\[x = 100000\left($b \sqrt{y} -1\right)\]
\[x = 100000\left(\frac{$b \sqrt{y} -1}{$a \sqrt{y}}\right)\]
$PAR
The appropriate definite integral for computing this area has integrand
$BR
\{ ans_rule(60)\};
$BR
lower limit of integration = \{ ans_rule()\};
$BR
and upper limit of integration = \{ ans_rule()\}
$PAR
This definite integral has value
 =  \{ ans_rule()\}
$BR
This is the area of the region enclosed by the two curves.

the appropriate integral for computing this area has the general
form
\[\int_a^b |f(y) - g(y)|\,dy\]
