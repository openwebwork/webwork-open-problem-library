BEGIN_TEXT
Using diaries for many weeks, a study on the lifestyles of visually impaired students was conducted.  The students
kept track of many lifestyle variables including how many hours of sleep obtained on a typical day.  Researchers
found that visually impaired students averaged \($mu\) hours of sleep, with a standard deviation of \($sigma\)
hours.  Assume that the number of hours of sleep for these visually impaired students is normally distributed.
$PAR
(a) \( \) What is the probability that a visually impaired student gets less than \($a\) hours of sleep? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \) What is the probability that a visually impaired student gets between \($b\) and \($c\) hours of sleep? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \) $event[$tag] percent of students get less than how many hours of sleep on a typical day? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} hours
