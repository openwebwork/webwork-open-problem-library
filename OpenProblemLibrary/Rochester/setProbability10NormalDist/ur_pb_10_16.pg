BEGIN_TEXT

Healty people have body temperatures that are normally distributed with a mean of 
\( 98.20^{\circ}F\) and a standard deviation of \( 0.62^{\circ}F \) . $BR

(a) \( \) If a healthy person is randomly selected, what is the probability that he or she has a 
temperature above \($t^{\circ}F\)? $BR

answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

(b) \( \) A hospital wants to select a minimum temperature for requiring further medical tests. 
What should that temperature be, if we want only  $p $PERCENT  of healty people to exceed it? $BR

answer: \{ans_rule(10)\}
