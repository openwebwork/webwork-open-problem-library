The combined math and verbal scores for females taking the SAT-I test are 
normally distributed with a mean of 998 and a standard deviation of 202 
(based on date from the College Board). If a college includes a minimum score of $s
among its requirements, what percentage of females do not satisfy that requirement? $BR
