BEGIN_TEXT
The extract of a plant native to Taiwan has been tested as a possible treatment for Leukemia.  One of
the chemical compounds produced from the plant was analyzed for a particular collagen.  The collagen
amount was found to be normally distributed with a mean of \($mu\) and standard deviation of
\($sigma\) grams per mililiter. $PAR
(a) \( \) What is the probability that the amount of collagen is greater than \($a\) grams per mililiter? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \) What is the probability that the amount of collagen is less than \($b\) grams per mililiter? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \) What percentage of compounds formed from the extract of this plant fall within \($c\) standard
deviations of the mean? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PERCENT
