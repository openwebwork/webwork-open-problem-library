BEGIN_TEXT
The physical fitness of an athlete is often measured by how much oxygen the athlete takes in (which is
recorded in milliliters per kilogram, ml/kg).  The mean maximum oxygen uptake for elite athletes has been found to
be \($mu\) with a standard deviation of \($sigma\).  Assume that the distribution is approximately normal. $PAR
(a) \( \) What is the probability that an elite athlete has a maximum oxygen uptake of at least \($a\) ml/kg? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \) What is the probability that an elite athlete has a maximum oxygen uptake of \($b\) ml/kg or lower? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \) Consider someone with a maximum oxygen uptake of \($c\) ml/kg.  Is it likely that this person is an elite athlete? 
Write "YES" or "NO." $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\}
