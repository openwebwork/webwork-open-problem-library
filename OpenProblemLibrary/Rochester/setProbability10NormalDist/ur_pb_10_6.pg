BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose that the readings on the thermometers are normally distributed with a mean of 
\( 0^{\circ} \) and a standard deviation of \( 1.00^{\circ} C \). $BR 
If  $p$PERCENT of the thermometers are rejected because they have readings that are 
too $high_low, but all other thermometers are acceptable, find the reading that separates 
the rejected thermometers from the others. $BR
