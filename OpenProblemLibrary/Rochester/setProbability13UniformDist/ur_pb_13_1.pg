A manager of an apartment store reports that the time of a customer on the second floor must wait for the
elevator has a uniform distribution ranging from \($a \) to \($b \) minutes.  If it takes the elevator
\( $c[$tag] \) seconds to go from floor to floor, find the probability that a hurried customer can reach the first
floor in less than \($d\) minutes after pushing the elevator button on the second floor. $PAR
