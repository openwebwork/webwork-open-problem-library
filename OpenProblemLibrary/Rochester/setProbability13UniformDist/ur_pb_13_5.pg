BEGIN_TEXT
The weather in Rochester in December is fairly constant.  Records indicate that
the low temperature for each day of the month tend to have a uniform
distribution over the interval \(15^{\circ}\) to \(35^{\circ}\)F.  A business
man arrives on a randomly selected day in December. $PAR
(a) \( \) What is the probability that the temperature will be above
\($a^{\circ}\)? $BR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \) What is the probability that the temperature will be between
\($b^{\circ}\) and \($c^{\circ}\)? $BR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \) What is the expected temperature? $BR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\}
