Consider the function \( f(x) = $a1  x^3 - $b1 x\) on the interval \( [ -$c1 , $c1 ] \).
Find the average or mean slope of the function on this interval. \{ans_rule(20) \}

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
By the Mean Value Theorem, we know there exists at least one \( c \) in the open interval
\( ( -$c1 , $c1 ) \) such that \( f'( c) \) is equal to this mean slope.  $BR
For this problem, there are two values of \( c \) that work.  The smaller one is \{ans_rule(20) \}
EOT
$ans = -$c1/sqrt(3);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and the larger one is \{ans_rule(20) \}
EOT
$ans = $c1/sqrt(3);
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
