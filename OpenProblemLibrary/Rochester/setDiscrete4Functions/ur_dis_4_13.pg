BEGIN_TEXT
You are the head of a division of a big Silicon Valley company and have assigned one
of your engineers, Jim, the job of devising an algorithm to sort through an English
text of \(n\) words and convert it into an Esperanto document.$PAR Jim comes up with an algorithm which takes \(2n^2+2^n\) bit operations to handle an
input text with n words. $PAR Suppose the computers in your business can handle one bit operation every nanosecond
(\(1\) nanosecond \(= 10^{-9}\) seconds).$PAR How many nanoseconds would it take Jim's algorithm to convert a text with \(10\) words
on these computers?\{ans_rule(15)\}$PAR How many DAYS would it take Jim's algorithm to convert a text with \(50\) words on these
computers?( Do not round your answers for WeBWorK.) \{ans_rule(15)\}$PAR
