BEGIN_TEXT
 $BR
Suppose a list of increasing integers is 1,3,4,5,8,9,11. $BR
Suppose we conduct the binary search algorithm on this list 
where we search for 8. $BR

In the language of Algorithm 3 in the book, enter the correct 
values for the following variables for this particular search: $BR

\( x = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \} 
\( n = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( a_2 = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( a_4 = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR

After the first iteration of the while loop, what are the values of 
the following variables? $BR

\( i = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( j = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( m = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp( 8 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 7 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 3 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 5 ) );

ANS(num_cmp( 5 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 7 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 4 ) );

$cmc = new_checkbox_multiple_choice();

$cmc -> qa (
"\( S \) has the following elements:",
"8",
"9",
"11"
);

$cmc -> extra(
"1",
"3",
"4",
"5"
);

BEGIN_TEXT
Intuitively, after the first iteration of the while loop, 
we have cut down our search to a set S of roughly half of the original
numbers on the list. Check the numbers that are in the set S after 
the first iteration of the while loop: $BR
\{ $cmc -> print_q \}
$PAR
\{ $cmc -> print_a \}
END_TEXT

ANS(checkbox_cmp( $cmc -> correct_ans ) );

BEGIN_TEXT
After the second iteration of the while loop, some of the
variables have 
altered values. Enter the values of the following variables after the 
second while loop iteration: $BR
\( i = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( j = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( m = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp( 5 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 6 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 6 ) );

BEGIN_TEXT
After the third iteration of the while loop, some of the
variables have 
altered values. Enter the values of the following variables after the 
third while loop iteration: $BR
\( i = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( j = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
\( m = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp( 5 ) );
ANS(num_cmp( 5 ) );

BEGIN_TEXT
After the 3rd iteration of the while loop, 
the while loop terminates and the variable `location' is computed. 
Enter the value for this variable in this case: $BR
\( location = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$PAR
