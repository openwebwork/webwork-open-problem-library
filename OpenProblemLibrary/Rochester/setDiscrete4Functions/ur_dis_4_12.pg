BEGIN_TEXT
There are many methods to calculate 
\[ x^{2^k} \] 
for some positive integer k and given x. $BR
The first DIRECT METHOD, just multiplies \( x \) with itself to find 
\( x^2 \) and then multiplies \( x \) with \( x^2 \) to find \( x^3 \) 
and keeps going like this till \( x^{2^k} \) is found. $BR
Thus for example to find \( x^4 \) it requires 3 multiplications:
( \( x \) with itself to find \( x^2 \), \( x \) with \( x^2 \) to find \(
x^3 \) 
and finally \( x \) with \( x^3 \) to find \( x^4 \).) $BR
$PAR
On the other hand there is also a second method, the SQUARING METHOD, 
where we at each stage multiply the last number with itself. $BR
For example to find \( x^4 \), one first multiplies \( x \) with itself 
to get \( x^2 \), then one multiplies \( x^2 \) with itself to get 
\( x^4 \). $BR
Notice this second method only took 2 multiplications to find \( x^4 \).
$BR
Answer the following questions: $BR
To calculate \( x^{$a} \) with the first direct method takes 
\{ ans_rule(10) \} multiplications. $BR
To calculate \( x^{$a} \) with the second, squaring method takes
\{ ans_rule(10) \} multiplications. $BR
