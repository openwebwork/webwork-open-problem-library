The axis of a light in a lighthouse is tilted, but the light shines
perpendicular to its axis. When the light points east, it is
inclined upward at $theta $d1. When it points north, it is inclined upward
at $psi $d2. What is its maximum angle of elevation?

Consider the ground to be the \(xy\)-plane, with the positive $x$-axis
pointing east and the positive \(y\)-axis pointing north.
Let \(v=<a,b,1>\) be a vector pointing in the direction of the axis of
the lighthouse.  Then this is perpendicular to the light coming out
of the lighthouse.   When the light shines eastward, it is parallel
to the vector \(<1,0,\tan($theta^\circ)>\), and when it shines northward,
it is parallel to the vector \(<0,1,\tan(\psi^\circ)>\).  Since the
dot product of perpendicular vecters is 0, we have that the axis
of the lighthouse is in the direction of \(v=<-\tan($theta^\circ),
-\tan($psi^\circ), 1>\).
$PAR
Now let \(\theta\) denote the angle \(v\), the axis of the lighthouse,
makes
with the \(xy\)-plane (the ground).  Then the maximum angle for the
light is \(90^\circ-\theta\) (drop a perpendicular from the this vector
to the ground -- then look at the picture in the plane determined by 
the axis and this perpendicular).  Moreover, the projection of \(v\)
to the ground is \(<-\tan($theta^\circ),-\tan($psi^\circ)>\) which
has length \(\sqrt{\tan^2($theta^\circ)+\tan^2($psi^\circ)}\).
Considering the triangle formed by \(v\) and its perpendicular to the
ground, we get \[\tan(\theta)=1/\sqrt{\tan^2($theta^\circ)+
\tan^2($psi^\circ)},\] 
so 
\[\tan(90^\circ-\theta) = \sqrt{\tan^2($theta^\circ)+
\tan^2($psi^\circ)}.\]
Finally, taking care of degrees/radians conversions, the desired angle
is
\[ \arctan\left(\sqrt{\tan^2($theta\cdot \pi/180)+
\tan^2($psi\cdot \pi/180)}\right)\cdot \frac{180}{\pi}. \]
