Four buses carrying \($total\) high school students arrive to Montreal. The buses carry, respectively, \($a\), \($b\), \($c\), and \($d\)
students. One of the students is randomly selected. Let \(X\) denote the number of students that were on the bus carrying this randomly
selected student. One of the \(4\) bus drivers is also randomly selected. Let \(Y\) denote the number of students on his bus. Compute the
expectations of \(X\) and \(Y\):
$BR

\(E(X)=\)\{ans_rule(30)\} $BR

\(E(Y)=\)\{ans_rule(30)\}
