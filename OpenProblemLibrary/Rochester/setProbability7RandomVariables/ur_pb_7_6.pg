$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
(a)  Let \(W\) be the amount of money (in dollars) won by an entry.  Then 
\[ \begin{aligned}
E[W]  = &$p1mil\cdot P(W = $p1mil) + $p2th \cdot P(W = $p2th) +  $p3th \cdot P(W = $p3th)\\
& + \, $p4th \cdot P(W = $p4th) +$p5 \cdot P( W = $p5) + $p6 \cdot P( W = $p6)\\
 & = \frac{$p1mil}{$c1mil} + \frac{$p2th}{$c2mil} + \frac{$p3th}{$c3mil} + \frac{$p4th}{$c4mil} + \frac{$p5}{$c5th} + \frac{$p6}{$c6th} \\
&= $ans1
\end{aligned} \]
So the expected value of the amount won by one entry in the sweepstakes is about $centswon cents.
$PAR
(b) Let \(X\) be the net earnings from one entry into the sweepstakes.  Then \(X = W - $cost_of_stamp\), so 
\[ E[X] = E[W- $cost_of_stamp] = E[W] - $cost_of_stamp = $ans2.\]
Hence, taking into account the cost of postage, there is an expected $loss of about $netloss cents from one entry into the sweepstakes.
