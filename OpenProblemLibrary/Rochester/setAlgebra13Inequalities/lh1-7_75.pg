BEGIN_TEXT

Find the interval on the real number line for which the radicand is nonnegative (greater than or equal to zero) so that the radical
 \[ \sqrt{$a x ? {$b}} \] 
defines a real number. Write your answer in interval notation. 
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, U. 
If needed enter \(\infty\) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
$BR
For example, you may write (-infinity, 5] for the interval \((-\infty,5]\) and (-infinity, 5]U(7,9) for \((-\infty,5]\cup(7,9)\).
$BR $BR 
Your answer: \{ans_rule(35) \}
