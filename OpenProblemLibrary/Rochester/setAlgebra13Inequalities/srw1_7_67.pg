Solve the following inequality. Write the answer in interval notation. 
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
If the answer includes more than one interval write the intervals separated by the "union" symbol, U. 
If needed enter \(\infty\) as $BITALIC infinity $EITALIC and \(-\infty \) as $BITALIC -infinity $EITALIC .
\[ $a \le \frac{5}{9}(F-32) \le $b \]
$BR
Answer:  \{ans_rule(40)\}

$ans1 = 9*$a/5+32;
$ans2 = 9*$b/5+32;
ANS(interval_cmp("[$ans1,$ans2]"));
