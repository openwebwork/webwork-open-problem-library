BEGIN_TEXT
Fuzzy Logic is used in artificial 
intelligence. In fuzzy logic, a proposition has a truth value that is a 
number between 0 and 1 inclusive. A proposition with a truth value of 0 
is false and one with truth value of 1 is true. Truth values that are
between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of truth. For instance, the
truth value \{ $a \} can be assigned to the statement "Fred is happy." 
since Fred is happy most of the time, and the truth value \{ $b \} can be
assigned to the statement "John is happy." since John is happy
slightly less than half the time. $BR
$PAR The truth value of the negation of a proposition in fuzzy logic is 
1 minus the truth value of the proposition. The truth value of a
conjunction of two propositions
in fuzzy logic is the minimum of the truth values of the two propositions.
$BR

(a) ``Fred and John are happy.'' $BR
