BEGIN_PGML
In this problem [`T`] is a transformation from one vector space to another.

* [`P_n`] refers to the vector space of polynomials [`f(t)`] of degree [`\leq n`] with real coefficients,

* _the space of infinite sequences_ is the space of infinite sequence of real numbers,
 
* [`C^{\infty}`] is the space of infinitely differentiable real-valued functions [`f(t)`] defined for all [`-\infty < t < \infty`], and
 
* [`\mathbb{C}`] refers to the complex numbers.  
 
Each space, including [`\mathbb{C}`], should be viewed as a vector space over the real numbers [`\mathbb{R}`], in other words [`\mathbb{R}`] is the set of scalars.  

*Question:* From the following list, select the transformations [`T`] that are *linear*. There may be more than one correct answer. Be sure you can justify your answers.
