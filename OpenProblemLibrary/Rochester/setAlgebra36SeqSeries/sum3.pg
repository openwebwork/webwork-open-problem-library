Evaluate the following sum without writing out all the terms:

\[\sum_{n=$j}^{$k} $term \]
$BR
The sum is \{ans_rule(10)\}.

$HINT $BR
You definitely don't want to calculate all the terms and them add them up.  That
could take a long time.
$BR$BR
You should know how to evaluate each of the following series.  If not, look in 
your textbook.
$BR
\[\sum\limits^{$k}_{n=$j} n^2\]
\[\sum\limits^{$k}_{n=$j} n\]
\[\sum\limits^{$k}_{n=$j} 1\]
$BR
Think about how you can use those sums to find the one you've been asked for.
