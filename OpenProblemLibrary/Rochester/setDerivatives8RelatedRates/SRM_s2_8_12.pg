At noon, ship A is $a1 nautical miles due west of ship B.  Ship A is sailing
west at $b1 knots and ship B is sailing north at $c1 knots.
How fast (in knots) is the distance between the ships changing at $t1 PM? (Note: 1 knot is a
speed of 1 nautical mile per hour.) $BR
\{ans_rule(50) \}
$BR
Note: Draw yourself a diagram which shows where the ships are at noon and where they are "some time" later on.  You will need to use geometry to work out a formula which tells you how far apart the ships are at time t, and you will need to use "distance = velocity * time" to work out how far the ships have travelled after time t.
