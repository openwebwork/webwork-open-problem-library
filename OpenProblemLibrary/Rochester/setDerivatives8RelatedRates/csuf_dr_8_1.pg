Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a rate of \($a \mbox{cm}^3\mbox{/s}\). 
How fast is the surface area of the balloon increasing when its radius is \($b \mbox{cm}\)? 
Recall that a ball of radius \(r\) has volume \(\displaystyle V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) and surface area \(S=4\pi r^2\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
Solve \( S=4\pi r^2\) for \(r\): 
$BR $BR 
\(\displaystyle r= \left(\frac{S}{4\pi}\right)^{1/2} = \frac{S^{1/2}}{2 \pi^{1/2}} \) 
$BR $BR Then 
\(\displaystyle V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{S^{3/2}}{2^3 \pi^{3/2}} = 
\frac{S^{3/2}}{6\pi^{1/2}} \)
$BR $BR 
Now differentiate both sides of \(\displaystyle V = \frac{S^{3/2}}{6\pi^{1/2}} \) 
with respect to time \((t)\): 
$BR $BR 
\(\displaystyle V' = \frac{\frac{3}{2} S^{1/2} S'}{6\pi^{1/2}} = 
\frac{S^{1/2} S'}{4\pi^{1/2}} \) 
$BR $BR We are given that \(V'=$a\). 
$BR $BR Also, if \(r=$b\), then \(S=4\pi\cdot $b^2 = $s\pi\).  
$BR $BR Thus we have 
\(\displaystyle $a = \frac{$sq \pi^{1/2} S'}{4\pi^{1/2}} = \frac{$sq S'}{4} \)
$BR $BR \(\displaystyle S' = \frac{$a\cdot 4}{$sq} = $ans\)
