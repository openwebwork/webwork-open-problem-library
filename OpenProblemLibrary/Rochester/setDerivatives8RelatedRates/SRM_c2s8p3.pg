TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of \(!{$flowRate:%5.1f}
\)
cubic centimeters per min at the same time that water is being pumped
 into the tank at
a constant rate.  The tank has height \(!{$height:%5.1f}\) meters and the diameter at
the top is \(!{$diameter:%5.1f}\) meters.  If the water level is rising at a rate of
\( !{$levelRate:%5.1f}\) centimeters per minute when the height of the water is
\(! {$level:%5.1f}\) meters,
find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank in cubic
centimeters per minute.

$BR
Note: Let "R" be the unknown rate at which water is being pumped in.  Then you know that if \(V\) is volume of water, \(\frac{dV}{dt}=R-!{$flowRate:%5.1f}\).  Use geometry (similar triangles?) to find the relationship between the height of the water and the volume of the water at any given time.  Recall that the volume of a cone with base radius r and height h is given by \(\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\).
