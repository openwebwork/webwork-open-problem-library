TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The altitude of a triangle is increasing at a rate of \(!{$altSpeed:%5.3f} \)
centimeters/minute while the area of the triangle is increasing at a rate
of \(!{$areaSpeed:%5.3f}\) square centimeters/minute.  At what rate is the base
of the triangle changing when the altitude is \(!{$alt:%5.3f}\) centimeters and
the area is \(!{$area:%5.3f}\) square centimeters?

$BR
Note: The "altitude" is the "height" of the triangle in the formula "Area=(1/2)*base*height".  Draw yourself a general "representative" triangle and label the base one variable and the altitude (height) another variable.  Note that to solve this problem you don't need to know how big nor what shape the triangle really is.
