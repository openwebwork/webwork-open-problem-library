BEGIN_PGML
The Manhattan distance [`D_M`] between the points [` (x_1,y_1) `] and
[` (x_2, y_2) `] is defined to be

    [`D_M = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1-y_2| `]

The Manhattan distance between [`([$x1], [$y1])`] and [`([$x2], [$y2])`]
is [_]{$distance}{15}.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
[`D_M = |[$x1] - [$x2]| + |[$y1] - [$y2]| = [$distance] `]
END_PGML_SOLUTION
