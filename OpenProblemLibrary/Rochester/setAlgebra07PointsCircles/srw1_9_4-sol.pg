SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR

Recall that for two points \(P(x_1, y_1)\) and \(Q(x_2,y_2)\), the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) is
\[ |PQ|=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2} \]
and the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment that joins \(P\) and \(Q\) are
\[ x_m = \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \ \ \ \ \ y_m = \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} \]

Therefore the distance between \( ($x1 ,$y1 )\) and \( ($x2 ,$y2 )\) is
\[ d=\sqrt{($x2 - $x1)^2+($y2 - $y1)^2} = \sqrt{$dsq} = $len1 \]

and the coordinates of the midpoint are

\[ x_m = \frac{$x1+$x2}{2} = $midx, \ \ \ \ \ y_m = \frac{$y1+$y2}{2} = $midy \]

Note: if you did not know the formulas for the coordinates of the midpoint, you could just draw a
coordinate system, plot the given points, and find the midpoint of the segment joining them. You would
see from the picture what are the coordinates of the midpoint.
