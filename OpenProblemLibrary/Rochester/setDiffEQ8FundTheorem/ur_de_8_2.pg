BEGIN_TEXT

This problem involves using the uniqueness property (from the Fundamental Theorem of ordinary differential equations.) It can't be graded by WeBWorK, but is to be handed in at the first class after the due date. 

$PAR

A. Using the same technique as in the previous problem show that if a function \(y_1(t)\) satisfies: (1) \(y_1(0)\) = 1 and (2) \(y'(t) = y(t)\) then
\[ \left(y_1(t)\right)^r = y_1(rt) \]
$HR

B. Explain in words how this relates to another law of exponents.
