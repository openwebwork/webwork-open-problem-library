BEGIN_TEXT

This problem involves using the uniqueness property (from the Fundamental Theorem of ordinary
differential equations.)  It can't be graded by WeBWorK, but is to be handed in at the first
class after the due date. 


$PAR

Use the same ideas as in the previous problems.
$PAR
A. Suppose that \(y_1(t)\) satisfies the equation \( y''+y=0\) and \(y_1(0) = 0 \)and \(y_1'(0)=1\). Such a function exists because of the fundamental theorem. (We all know that it is \(sin(t)\), but you should not use that fact in answering the questions below.)
$PAR
Show that \(y_2(t)=y_1'(t)\) also satisfies the equation \( y''+y=0\) and that \(y_2(0)=1\) and \(y_2'(0)=0\).
$HR
B. If \(y_3(t)=y_2'(t)\) show, using the uniqueness property, that \(y_3(t)=-y_1(t)\)
$HR
C. State the uniqueness property for solutions to second order differential equations (or equivalently to a system of two  first order differential equations).
$HR

D. Use the uniqueness property to show that \(y_1(t+a)=y_1'(a)y_1(t) + y_1(a)y_2(t) = y_2(a)y_1(t) + y_1(a)y_2(t)\)
$HR

The formulas for the sin of sums of angles can be calculated completely from the one fact that it satisfies a differential equation. This is a general fact. Any solution of a differential equation has the potential for obeying certain "laws" which are dictated by the differential equation.
