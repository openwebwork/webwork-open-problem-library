BEGIN_TEXT

This problem involves using the uniqueness property (from the Fundamental Theorem of ordinary differential equations.)  It can't be graded by WeBWorK, but is to
be handed in at the first class after the due date.
$PAR

A. State the uniqueness property of the fundamental theorem.
$HR
B. Show directly using the differential equation, that if \( y_1(t) \) is a solution to the differential equation \(y'(t)= y(t)\), then \(y_2(t)=y_1(t+a) \) is also a solution to the differential equation. (You will need to use the known facts about \(y_1\) to calculate that \( y_2'(t) = y_2(t) \) ).  (We know that the solution is the exponential function, but you will not need to use this fact.)
$HR
C. Describe the relationship between the graphs of \( y_1 \) and \(y_2 \) and using a sketch of the direction field explain why it is obvious that if \( y_1 \) is a solution then \(y_2 \) has to be a solution also.
$HR
D. Describe in words why if \( y_1(t) \) is any solution to the differential equation \( y'=f(y) \) then \( y_2(t) = y_1(t+a)  \) is also a solution.
$HR
E. Show that if \( y_1(t) \) solves \( y'(t)= y(t) \), then \( y_2(t) = Ay_1(t) \) also solves the same equation.
$HR
F. Suppose that \( y_1(t) \) solves \( y'(t)= y(t) \) and \( y(0)=1\).  (Such a solution is guaranteed by the fundamental theorem.).  Let \( y_2(t) = y_1(t+a) \) and  let \( y_3(t)=y_1(a)y_1(t) \).  Calculate the values \(y_2(0)\) and \( y_3(0) \).  Use the uniqueness property to show that \( y_2(t) = y_3(t) \) for all \( t \).
$HR
G. Explain how this proves that any solution to \(y' = y\) must be a function which obeys the law of exponents.
$HR
H. Let \( z=x + iy \).  Define \( \exp(z) \) ( or \( e^z \) ) using a Taylor series.  Show that
if \( z=x+iy \) is a constant, then
 \[ \frac{d}{dt} \exp(tz) = z \exp(tz) \]
by differentiating the power series.
$HR
I. Use your earlier results to show that \( \exp(z+w)=\exp(z)\exp(w) \).  This method of checking the law of exponents is MUCH easier than expanding the power series.
