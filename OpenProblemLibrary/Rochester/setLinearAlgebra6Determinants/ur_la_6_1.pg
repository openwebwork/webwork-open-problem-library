BEGIN_TEXT 

Consider the following general matrix equation:
$BR
\{ mbox( display_matrix($A), '\(=\)', display_matrix($M), display_matrix($X) ) \}
$BR
which can also be abbreviated as:
$BR
\[ A = M X \]
$BR
By definition, the determinant of \(M\) is given by \[ \det\,(M) = m_{11}m_{22}-m_{12}m_{21} \]
$BR
The following questions are about the relationship between the determinant of M and the ability 
to solve the equation above for A in terms of X or for X in terms of A.
$BR
Check the boxes which make the statement correct:
