# TEXT( ... , ... , )
# Is the simplest way of printing text, each string in the input is immediately printed.
# It does not do any of the simplifying and evaluating tricks performed by the BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT construction.

# beginproblem() is a macro which outputs the string 
# which contains the number
# of points the problem is worth.

# Putting these two ideas together prints the standard opening line of a problem.
# We will use this construction routinely at the beginning of all subsequent problems.

# Make a new match list
$ml = new_match_list();

# $ml now "contains" the match list object.  (Actually $ml is a scalar variable which contains a pointer to 
# the match list object, but you can think of the match list object as being shoe horned into the variable $ml.
# You need to remember that $ml contains (a pointer to) an object, and not ordinary data such as a number or string.

# Some people use the convention $o_ml to remind them that the variable contains an object, but for short problems
# that is probably not necessary.

# An object contains both data (in this case the list of questions and answers) and subroutines (called methods)
# for manipulating that data.


# Insert some  questions and matching answers in the q/a list by calling on the objects qa method.
# using the construction $ml ->qa(..list of alternating questions and matching answers ...).
# Think of this as asking the object $ml to store the  matching questions 
# and answers given in the argument to the method qa.

$ml -> qa (
"\( \sin(x) \)",        # Notice the use of the LateX construction for math mode: \\( ...  \\)
"\( \cos(x) \)",        # and the use of TeX symbols such as \\sin and \\tan
"\( \cos(x) \)",        # Use " ... " to enter a string
"\( -\sin(x) \)",
"\( \tan(x) \)",
"\( \sec^2(x) \)"       # Remember that in these strings we are only specifying typography, 
                        # via TeX, not any calculational rules.

# Calculate coefficients for another question
$b=random(2,5);

# Store the question and answers in the match list object. 
$ml -> qa (

$b2=random(2,5);

# Choose two of the question and answer pairs at random.
$ml ->choose(2);  # Using choose(3) would choose all three questions, but the order of the questions and answers would be 
                  # scrambled.
