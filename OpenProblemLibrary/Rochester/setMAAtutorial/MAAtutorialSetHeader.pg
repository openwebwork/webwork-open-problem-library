The primary purpose of WeBWorK is to let you know that you are getting the correct answer or to alert
you if you are making some kind of mistake. Usually you can attempt a problem as many times as you want before
the due date.  However, if you are having trouble figuring out your error, you should
consult the book, or ask a fellow student, one of the TA's or
your professor for help.  Don't spend a lot of time guessing -- it's not very efficient or effective.
$PAR
Give 4 or 5  significant digits for (floating point) numerical answers.
For most problems when entering numerical answers, you can if you wish
enter elementary expressions such as \( 2\wedge3 \) instead of 8, \( sin(3*pi/2) \)instead
of -1, \( e\wedge (ln(2)) \) instead of 2,
\( (2+tan(3))*(4-sin(5))\wedge6-7/8 \) instead of 27620.3413, etc.
 Here's the 
\{ htmlLink(qq!http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/docs/docs/pglanguage/availableFunctions.html!,"list of the functions") \}
 which WeBWorK understands.
$PAR
You can use the Feedback button on each problem
page to send e-mail to the professors.
