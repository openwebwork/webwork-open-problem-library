# At the moment there is no easy way to change the weight of the lines being drawn.  To do so one would want
# to incorporate some of the code in Fun.pm into WWPlot.pm itself.  The code involves gdBrushed.  
# Since GD  has
# gone through many revisions since the WWPlot.pm code was written it may now be possible to write some of 
# this code more efficiently.
