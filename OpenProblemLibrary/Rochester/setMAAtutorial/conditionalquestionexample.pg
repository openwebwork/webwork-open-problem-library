# so that you can  refer to them later.  Look also at the pod documentation in

# least) these entries:
#       $ans_hash{score}        -- a number between 0 and 1
#       $ans_hash{correct_ans}  -- The correct answer, as supplied by the instructor
#       $ans_hash{student_ans}  -- This is the student's answer
#       $ans_hash{ans_message}  -- Any error message, or hint provided by
#                                                          the answer evaluator.
#       $ans_hash{type}   -- A string indicating the type of answer evaluator.
#                                         -- Some examples:
#                                               'number_with_units'
