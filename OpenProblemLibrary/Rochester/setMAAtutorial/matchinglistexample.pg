# Since this is a matching question, we do not usually wish to tell students
# which parts of the matching question have been answered correctly and which
# areincorrect.  That is too easy.  To accomplish this we set the following
# flag to zero.
$showPartialCorrectAnswers = 0;

# Make a new match list
$ml = new_match_list();
# enter questions and matching answers
$ml -> qa (
"\( \sin(x) \)",        # Notice the use of the LateX construction
"\( \cos(x) \)",                # for math mode: \\( ...  \\) and the use of TeX
"\( \cos(x) \)",        # symbols such as \\sin and \\tan.
"\( -\sin(x) \)",
"\( \tan(x) \)",
"\( \sec^2(x) \)",      # Remember that in these strings we are 
                                                # only specifying typography,via TeX,
"\( x^{20} \)",         #not any calculational rules.
"\( 20x^{19} \)",
"\( \sin(2x) \)",
"\( 2\cos(2x) \)",
"\( \sin(3x) \)",
"\( 3\cos(3x) \)"

# Calculate coefficients for another question
$b=random(2,5);
$exp= random(2,5);
$coeff=$b*$exp;
$new_exp = $exp-1;

# Store the question and answers in the match list object.
$ml -> qa (
    '\( ${b}x^$exp \)',

# Add another example

$new_exp2 = $exp-1;
$ml -> qa (
"\( ${b2}x^$exp2 \)",

);

# Choose four of the question and answer pairs at random.
$ml ->choose(4); 
# Using choose(8) would choose all eight questions,
# but the order of the questions and answers would be
# scrambled.

# The following code is needed to make the enumeration work right within tables
# when LaTeX output is being used.
# It is an example of the powerful tools of TeX and perl which are available
# for each PG problem author. 
# Once we figure out the best way to protect enumerated lists automatically
# we will include it in the tables macro.  Meantime, it is better to have
# have to do it by hand, rather than to have the wrong thing done automatically.

# End of code for protecting enumerated lists in TeX.

# Now print the text using $ml->print_q for
# the questions and $ml->print_a to print the answers.

BEGIN_TEXT
$PAR

Place the letter of the derivative next to each function listed below: $BR
\{ $ml -> print_q \}
$PAR
\{$ml -> print_a \}
$PAR
END_TEXT

ANS(str_cmp( $ml->ra_correct_ans )   ) ;
# insist that the first two questions (labeled 0 and 1) are always included
$ml ->choose([0,1],1);
BEGIN_TEXT
Let's print the questions again, but insist that the
first two questions (about sin and cos) always be included.
Here is a second way to format this question, using tables:
$PAR
\{begintable(2)\}
\{row(protect_enumerated_lists( $ml->print_q, $ml -> print_a) )\}
\{endtable()\}
$PAR
And below is yet another way to enter a table of questions and answers:
$PAR
END_TEXT
ANS(str_cmp( $ml->ra_correct_ans )   ) ;
# Finally add a last answer
$ml ->makeLast("The derivative is $BR not provided");
BEGIN_TEXT
    \{ begintable(2) \}
    \{ row(   protect_enumerated_lists($ml->print_q, $ml ->print_a))\}
    \{endtable()\}
END_TEXT
# Enter the correct answers to be checked against the answers to the students.
ANS(str_cmp( $ml->ra_correct_ans )   ) ;
