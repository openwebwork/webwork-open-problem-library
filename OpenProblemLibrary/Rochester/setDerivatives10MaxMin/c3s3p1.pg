TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
The  function
\[ f(x) = $A3 x^3 + $A2 x^2 + $A1 x + $A0 \]
is decreasing on the interval ( \{ans_rule(5)\} , \{ans_rule(5) \}  ).
$BR
It is increasing on the interval ( \(-\infty\), \{ans_rule(5) \} ) and the
interval ( \{ans_rule(5) \}, \(\infty \)  ).
$BR
The function has a local maximum at \{ans_rule(10) \}.

EOT

ANS(num_cmp([$a,$b,$a,$b,$a], relTol=>.1));

$A22 = $A2*2; 

$apb = $a + $b; 
$ab = $a*$b; 

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOF'));
$SOL $BR
To find the intervals of increase and decrease, we have to find the intervals where the derivative is positive and where it is negative.  
$BR \(f'(x) = $c x^2 + $A22 x + $A1\). 
$BR The derivative is \(0\) when \( $c x^2 + $A22 x + $A1 = 0\). 
$BR \( $c ( x^2 - $apb x + $ab) = 0 \) 
$BR \( $c (x- $a)(x- $b) = 0 \) 
$BR We have two roots: \(x=$a\) and \(x=$b\). 
$BR It is easy to check that \(f'(x)\) is negative (and therefore \(f(x)\) is decreasing) on the interval \(($a,$b)\). 
$BR \(f'(x)\) is positive (and therefore  \(f(x)\) is increasing) on the interval 
\( (-\infty, $a) \) and on the interval \( ($b, \infty) \). 
$BR Since \(f'(x)\) changes from positive to negative at \($a\), \(f(x)\) has a local maximum at \($a\).
