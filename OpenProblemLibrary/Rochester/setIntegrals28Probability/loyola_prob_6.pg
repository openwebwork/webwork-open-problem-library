At a particular fast-food restaurant, food is often made in advance, and then it is placed under a heater until it is sold.  The distribution function for the number of minutes that passes between when a cheeseburger is made and when it is sold is given by
\[ f(t) = \begin{cases}
 \frac{2}{$D} - \frac{2}{$e}t & \text{if} \;\; 0\leq t \leq $D\\
 0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
Find the median number of minutes that a cheeseburger sits under the heater.
