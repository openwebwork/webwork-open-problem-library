Use the computer to check the steps for you as you go along.
There is partial credit on this problem.
$BR $BR 
A recent college graduate borrows \($P\) dollars at an (annual) interest
rate of \($i\) per cent. Anticipating steady salary increases, the buyer
expects to make payments at a monthly rate of \( $a (1+t / $b) \) dollars per
month, where \(t\) is the number of months since the loan was made.
$BR $BR 
Let \(y(t)\) be the amount of money that the graduate owes \(t\) months
after the loan is made. $BR 
\(y(0) = \) \{ans_rule(15) \} (dollars)
END_TEXT

ANS(num_cmp($P) );

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR $BR 
With \( y \) representing the amount of money in dollars  at time \(t\) (in months) write a
differential equation which models this situation.
$BR \(y' = f( t , y ) = \)  \{ans_box(3,60)\}.$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use \( y \) rather than \( y(t) \) since the latter confuses the computer.
Remember to check your units, but don't enter units for this equation -- the computer won't
understand them. 
END_TEXT

ANS(fun_cmp($mydiffeq ,var => ['t','y'],limits=>[[0,50],[100,8000]], numPoints => 10 ) );

BEGIN_TEXT
$BR
$BR
Find an equation for the amount of money owed after \(t\) months.
$BR
\( y(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(70) \}
\{ANS(fun_cmp($mysolution, var =>'t', numPoints => 30,limits=>[0,10]  ) );"";\}
$BR $BR 
Next we are going to think about how many months it will take until
the loan is paid off.  Remember that \(y(t)\) is the amount that is
owed after \(t\) months. The loan is paid off when
\(y(t)\) = \{ans_rule(15) \}
\{ANS(num_cmp(0) ); ''\}
$BR $BR
Once you have calculated how many months it will take to pay off the
loan, give your answer as a decimal, ignoring the fact that in real
life there would be a whole number of months. To do this, you should
use a graphing calculator or use 
\{htmlLink(
("http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/applets/applets_on_webwork.html"),
"a plotter on this page"
)\}
to estimate the root. If you use the
\{htmlLink(
("http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/applets/applets_on_webwork.html"),
"the xFunctions plotter,"  
)\}
then once you have launched xFunctions,
pull down the Multigaph Utility from the menu in the upper right
hand corner, enter the function you got for \(y\) (using \(x\) as the
independent variable, sorry!), choose appropriate 
ranges for the axes, and then eyeball a solution.$BR
$BR
The loan will be paid off in \{ans_rule(20) \} months.
\{ANS(num_cmp($monthstopayoff , tol =>1)); ''\}
$BR $BR
If the borrower wanted the loan to be paid off in exactly \(20\) years, with
the same payment plan as above, how much could be borrowed?
$BR
Borrowed amount = \{ ans_rule( 40 ) \}
\{ANS(num_cmp($borrow20years , reltol => 1)); ''\}
