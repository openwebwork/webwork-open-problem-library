BEGIN_TEXT

Here is a somewhat realistic example.
You should use the
phase plane plotter to look at some solutions graphically before you start solving this problem and
to compare with your analytic answers to help you find errors.  You will probably be surprised to find
how long it takes to get all of the details of solution of a realistic problem right,
even when you know how to do each of the steps.  
$BR $BR 
There are  \($initial_amount\) dollars in the bank account at the beginning of January 1990, and  money is added
and withdrawn from the account at a rate which follows a sinusoidal pattern, peaking in January and in July
with money being added at a rate corresponding to \($max_deposit_rate\) dollars per year, while maximum withdrawals take
place at the rate of \($max_withdrawal_rate\) dollars per year in April and October.
$BR $BR 
 The interest rate remains constant
at the rate of \( $r100 \) percent per year, compounded continuously.
$BR $BR 
Let \( y(t) \) represents the amount of money at time \( t \)  (\(t\) is in years). $BR 
\(y(0) = \) \{ans_rule(5) \} (dollars)
\{ANS(num_cmp($initial_amount) ); ''\}
$BR $BR 
Write a formula for the rate of deposits and withdrawals (using the functions sin(), cos() and constants):$BR
\( g(t) \) = \{ ans_rule(50) \}
\{ ANS(fun_cmp($forcing_eq , var => 't') ); ''; \}
$BR $BR 
The interest rate remains constant at \( $r100\) percent per year over this period of time.$BR
With \( y \) representing the amount of money in dollars  at time \(t\) (in years) write a
differential equation which models this situation.
$BR \(y' = f( t , y ) = \)  \{ans_box(3,60)\}.$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use \( y \) rather than \( y(t) \) since the latter confuses the computer.
Don't enter units for this equation.
\{ ANS(fun_cmp($diffeq ,var => ['t','y'],limits=>[[-5,5],[-5,5]], numPoints => 5 )); ''; \}
$BR $BR 
Find an equation for the amount of money in the account at time \(t \)  where \( t \) is the number of years since
January 1990.
$BR
\( y(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(50) \}
\{  ANS(fun_cmp( $solution_eq,  var => ['t'],limits=>[-log($C),0],reltol=>.1)  ); '';\}
$BR $BR 
Find the amount of money in the bank at the beginning of January 2000 (10 years later):
\{ans_rule(40) \}
\{ ANS(num_cmp(  $final_amount, format =>'%0.8g',reltol=>.1 )   ); '';   \}
$BR $BR 
Find a solution to the equation which does not become infinite (either positive or negative) over time:
$BR
\( y(t) = \) \{ ans_rule( 40 ) \}
\{ ANS(fun_cmp($equilibrium_solution, var =>['t'],reltol=>.1 ) );"";  \}
$BR $BR 
During which months of the year does this non-growing solution have the highest values?
\{  pop_up_list(0 => 'January and July', 1 => 'February and August', 2 => 'March and September', 3=> 'April and October',
4 => 'May and November', 5 => 'June and December')\}
\{ ANS(num_cmp( round(  ($cycle )*12) ) ); '';  \}
