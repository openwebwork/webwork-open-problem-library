BEGIN_TEXT

Susan finds an alien artifact in the desert, where there are
temperature variations from a low in the 30s at night to a high in the
100s in the day. She is interested in how the artifact will respond to 
faster variations in temperature, so she kidnaps the artifact, 
takes it back to her lab (hotly pursued by the military police
who patrol Area 51), and sticks it in an "oven" -- that is,
a closed box whose temperature she can control precisely.
$BR $BR 
Let \(T(t)\) be the temperature of the artifact.
Newton's law of cooling says that \(T(t)\) changes at a rate
proportional to the difference between the temperature of 
the environment and the temperature of the artifact. This says that there
is a constant \(k\), not dependent on time, such that 
\( T' = k(E - T) \), where \(E\) is the temperature of the environment
(the oven).
$BR $BR   
Before collecting the artifact from the desert, Susan measured its
temperature at a couple of times, and she has determined that for 
the alien artifact,  \(k = $k\).  
$BR $BR 
Susan preheats her oven to \($E\) degrees 
Fahrenheit (she has stubbornly refused to join the metric world). 
At time \( t = 0\) the oven is at exactly \($E\) degrees and is heating up, 
and  the oven runs through a temperature cycle every \(2 \pi \)
minutes,  in which its temperature varies by \($V\) degrees above and \($V\) 
degrees below \($E\) degrees.
$BR $BR 
Let \(E(t)\)  be the temperature of the oven after \(t \) minutes.
$BR
\( E(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(70) \}
$BR $BR 
At time \(t = 0\), when
the artifact is at a temperature of \($starttemp\) degrees, she puts it in
the oven. Let \( T(t)\) be the temperature of the artifact at
time \( t\). Then \(T(0) = \) \{ans_rule(15) \} (degrees)
$BR $BR 
Write a differential equation which models
the temperature of the artifact.
$BR \(T' = f( t , T ) = \)  \{ans_box(3,60)\}.$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use \( T \) rather than \( T(t) \) since the latter confuses the computer.
Don't enter units for this equation. $BR $BR 
Solve the differential equation. To do this, you may find it helpful
to know that if \(a\) is a constant, then $BR
\[ \int \sin(t)e^{at} dt = \frac{1}{a^{2}+1} e^{at} (a \sin(t) - \cos(t)) + C.\]
$BR
\( T(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(70) \}
$BR $BR 
After Susan puts in the artifact in the oven,
the military police break in and take her away. Think about
what happens to her artifact as \( t \rightarrow \infty \) and fill in
the following sentence:
$BR $BR
For large values of \(t\), even though the oven temperature varies
between $envirolow and $envirohigh degrees, the artifact varies from
\{ans_rule(15) \}
to
\{ans_rule(15) \}
degrees.$BR
