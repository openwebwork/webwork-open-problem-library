BEGIN_TEXT

A body of mass \($mass\) kg is projected vertically upward with an initial 
velocity \( $initial_v \) meters per second.
$BR $BR 
The gravitational constant is \( g = 9.8  m/s^2 \).  The air resistance is equal
to \( k|v| \) where \( k \) is a constant.  
$BR $BR 
Find a formula for the velocity at any time ( in terms of \(k\) ):
$BR
\( v(t) = \) \{ans_rule(60) \}
$BR $BR 
Find the limit of this velocity for a fixed time \(t_0 \) as the air 
resistance coefficient \(k\) goes to \(0\). (Write \(t_0\) as t0 in your answer.)
$BR
\( v(t_0) = \) \{ ans_rule(60) \}
$BR $BR 
How does this compare with the solution to the equation for velocity when there is no air resistance?
$BR $BR 
This illustrates an important fact, related to the fundamental theorem of ODE and called 'continuous 
dependence' on parameters and initial conditions.  What this means is that, for  a fixed time,
changing the initial conditions slightly, or changing the parameters slightly, only slightly changes
the value at time \(t\).  
$BR $BR 
The fact that the terminal time \(t\) under consideration is a fixed, finite number is important.  
If you consider 'infinite' \(t\), or the 'final' result you may get very different answers.  
Consider for example a solution to \(y'=y\), whose initial condition is essentially zero, 
but which might vary a bit positive or negative.  If the initial condition is positive the "final" 
result is plus infinity, but if the initial condition is negative the final condition is negative infinity.
