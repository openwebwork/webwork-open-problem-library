BEGIN_TEXT

Let \( P(t) \) be the performance level of someone learning a skill as a function of the training time \(t\).
The derivative \( \displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt} \) represents the rate at which performance improves. If \(M\)
is the maximum level of performance of which the learner is capable, then a model for learning is given by the
differential equation 
\[ \frac{dP}{dt} = k(M-P(t)) \] 
where \(k\) is a positive constant. 
$BR
Two new workers, $name[$tag1] and $name[$tag2], were hired for an assembly line. 
$name[$tag1] could process \($a\) units per minute after one hour and \($b\) units per minute after two
hours. $name[$tag2] could process \($c\) units per minute after one hour and \($d\) units per minute after two
hours. Using the above model and assuming that \(P(0)=0\), estimate the maximum number of units per minute
that each worker is capable of processing.
