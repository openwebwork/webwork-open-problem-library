A tank contains \($a\) L of  pure water.  A solution
that contains \($b\) kg of sugar per liter enters the 
tank at the rate \($c\) L/min. The solution is mixed and drains
from the tank at the same rate. $PAR

\(y(0) = \) \{ans_rule(5) \} (include units)

(b) With \(S \) representing the amount of sugar (in kg) at time t (in minutes) write a
differential equation which models this situation.
$BR \(S' = f(t,S) = \)  \{ans_box(3,60)\}.$BR
