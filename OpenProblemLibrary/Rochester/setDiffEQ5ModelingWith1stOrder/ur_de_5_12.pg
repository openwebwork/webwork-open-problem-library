BEGIN_TEXT

Another model for a growth function for a limited population is given by the Gompertz function, which is a solution of
the differential equation 
\[ \frac{dP}{dt} = c \ln \left( \frac{K}{P} \right) P \]
where \(c\) is a constant and \(K\) is the carrying capacity. 
$BR $BR 
(a) Solve this differential equation for \(c=$c\), \(K=$K\), and initial population \(P_0=$init\). $BR
\(P(t)=\) \{ans_rule(50)\}. 
$BR $BR
(b) Compute the limiting value of the size of the population. $BR 
\( \displaystyle \lim_{t\to \infty} P(t) = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}. 
$BR $BR 
(c) At what value of \(P\) does \(P\) grow fastest? $BR 
\(P=\) \{ans_rule(20)\}.
