BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR 
Note that \( x^2 + $b x + $c\)  is an irreducible quadratic since 
\( b^2 - 4ac = ($b)^2-4($c) = $d <0 \). $BR
Since the denominator factors in the linear term \(x-$f \) repeated three times, and in an irreducible quadratic, the correct form  of the partial fraction is: 
\[\displaystyle \int \left( \frac{A}{x - $f} + \frac{B}{(x - $f)^2} + \frac{C}{(x - $f)^3} + \frac{Dx + E}{x^2 + $b x + $c} \right)\, dx \]
Thus the correct answer is $BBOLD \{ $mc->correct_ans\} .$EBOLD
