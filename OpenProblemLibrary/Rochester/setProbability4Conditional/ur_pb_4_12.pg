In a certain community, $dog$PERCENT of the families own a dog, and $d_c$PERCENT of the families that own a dog also own
a cat. It is also known that $cat$PERCENT of all the families own a cat. $BR

What is the probability that a randomly selected family $quest1[$tag1] \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR

What is the conditional probability that a randomly selected family $quest2[$tag2] \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
