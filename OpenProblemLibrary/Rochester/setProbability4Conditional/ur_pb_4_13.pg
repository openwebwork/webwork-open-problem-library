BEGIN_TEXT

Urn  A  has $aw white and $ar red balls. Urn  B  has $bw white and $br red balls. We flip a fair coin. If the outcome is
heads, then a ball from urn A is selected, whereas if the outcome is tails, then a ball from urn B is selected. Suppose
that a $color[$tag] ball is selected. What is the probability that the coin landed heads?
