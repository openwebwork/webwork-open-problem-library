BEGIN_TEXT
Scoring a hole-in-one is the greatest shot a golfer can make.  Once \($b\) professional golfers each
made holes-in-one on the \($c^{th}\) hole at the same golf course at the same tournament.  It
has been found that the estimated probability of making a hole-in-one is \(\frac{1}{$a}\)for
male professionals.  Suppose that a sample of \($b\) professional male golfers is randomly selected.
$PAR
(a) \( \) $sevent[0] $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR
(b) \( \) $sevent[1] $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(20)\}
