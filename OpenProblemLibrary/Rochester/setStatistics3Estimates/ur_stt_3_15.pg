BEGIN_TEXT
Astronaunts often report that there are times when they become disoriented as they move around in
zero-gravity.  Therefore, they ususally rely on bright colors and other visual information to help them
estabish a top-down orientation.  A study was conducted to assses the potential of using color as body
orienting.  \($n\) college students, reclining on their backs in the dark, found it difficult to
establish orientation when positioned on under a rotating disk.  This rotating disk was painted half black
and half white.  Out of the \($n\) students, \($a\) believed they were right side up when the white was on
top.  $PAR
Use this information to estimate the true proportion of subjects who use the white color as a
cue for right-side-up orientation.  That is, construct a $sconf[0] confidence interval for the true
proportion.  $BR
\{ans_rule(20)\} \( \leq p \leq \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
