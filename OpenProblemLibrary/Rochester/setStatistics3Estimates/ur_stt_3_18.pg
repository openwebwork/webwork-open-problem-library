BEGIN_TEXT

College officials want to estimate the percentage of students who carry a gun, knife, or
other such weapon. How many randomly selected students must be surveyed in order to be 
\( $perc\)$PERCENT  confident that the sample percentage has a margin of error of 
\( $e \) percentage points? $PAR

(a) \( \ \) Assume that there is no available information that could be used as an estimate 
of \( \hat{p} \). $PAR

Answer: \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PAR

(b) \( \ \) Assume that another study indicated that \( $a\)$PERCENT  of college 
students carry weapons.

Answer: \{ ans_rule(15) \} $PAR
