BEGIN_TEXT
Studies have suggusted that twins, in their early years, tend to have lower IQs and pick up language
more slowly than nontwins.  The slower intellectual growth might be caused by benign parental neglect. 
Suppose it is desired to estimate the mean attention time given to twins per week by their parents.  A
sample of \($n\) sets of 2 year old boys is taken, and after 1 week the attention time received
was recorded.  The data (in hours) calculated the mean at \($mean\) and the standard deviation at
\($sd\).  Use this information to contruct a \($sperc[0]\)$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean attention time given to al twin boys by their parents. $PAR
\{ans_rule(20)\} \( < \mu < \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
