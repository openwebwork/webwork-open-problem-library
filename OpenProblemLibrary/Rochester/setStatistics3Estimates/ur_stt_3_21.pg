According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a cup of coffee contains on average \($a\) miligrams (mg) of
caffeine, with the amount per cup ranging from \($r1\) to \($r2\) mg.  Suppose you want to repeat the FDA experiment

confidence.  How many cups of coffee would have to be included in your sample? $PAR
