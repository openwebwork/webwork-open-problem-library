BEGIN_TEXT
The EPA wants to test a randomly selected sample of \(n\) water specimens and estimate the mean daily
rate of pollution produced by a mining operation.  If the EPA wants a $sconf[0] confidence interval with
a bound of error of \($b\) milligram per liter (mg/L), how many water specimens are required in the
sample?  Assume prior knowledge indicates that pollution readings in water samples taken during a day
have been approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of \($sigma\) (mg/L). $PAR
\(n = \) \{ans_rule(20)\}
