BEGIN_TEXT

Among drivers who have had a car crash in the last year, $n  were randomly selected 
and categorized by age, with the results listed in the table below. 

\{begintable(5)\}
\{row('Age', 'Under 25', '25-44', '45-64', 'Over 64')\}
\{row('Drivers', $a[0], $a[1], $a[2], $a[3])\}
\{endtable()\}

If all ages have the 
same crash rate, we would expect (because of the age distribution of licensed drivers)
the given categories to have 16$PERCENT, 44$PERCENT, 27$PERCENT, 13$PERCENT
of the subjects, respectively. At the $alpha significance level, test the claim that the 
distribution of crashes conforms to the distribution of ages. $BR

The test statistic is \(\chi^2=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

The critical value is \(\chi^2=\) \{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

\{$mc->print_q()\}
\{$mc->print_a()\}
