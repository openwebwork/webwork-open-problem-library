Suppose that the  Wronskian of two functions \(f_1(t)\) and \(f_2(t)\) is given by
\{ mbox( '\( W(t) = t^2-4 = \det \)',display_matrix([ ["\( f_1(t) \)","\( f_2(t) \)"], ["\( f_1'(t) \)", "\( f_2'(t) \)"] ]) )\}    
Even though you don't know the functions \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) you can determine whether the following
questions are true or false.
