You go to the doctor and he gives you $b1 milligrams of radioactive dye.  After
$a1 minutes, $c1 milligrams of dye remain in your system.  To leave the doctor's
office, you must pass through a radiation detector without sounding the alarm.
If the detector will sound the alarm if more than 2 milligrams of the dye are
in your system, how long will your visit to the doctor take, assuming you were
given the dye as soon as you arrived?  Give your answer to the nearest minute.
