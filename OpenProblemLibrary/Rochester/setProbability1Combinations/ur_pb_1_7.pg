BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose you are managing $a employees, and you need to form three teams to work on different
projects.  Assume that all employees will work on a team, and that each employee has the same
qualifications/skills so that everyone has the same probability of getting choosen.  In how many
different ways can the teams be chosen so that the number of employees
 on each project are as follows: $BR$BR

$b,  $c,  $d $BR$BR

Answer: \{ans_rule(10)\}
