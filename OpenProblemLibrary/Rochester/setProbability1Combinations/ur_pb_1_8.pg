A computer retail store has \($n\) personal computers in stock.  A buyer wants to purchase \($r\) of
them.  Unknown to either the retail store or the buyer, \($r\) of the computers in stock have defective
hard drives.  Assume that the computers are selected at random. $PAR
(a) \( \) In how many different ways can the \($r\) computers be chosen? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\}$PAR
(b) \( \) What is the probability that exactly one of the computers will be defective? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \) What is the probability that at least one of the computers selected is defective? $PAR
answer: \{ans_rule(10)\}
