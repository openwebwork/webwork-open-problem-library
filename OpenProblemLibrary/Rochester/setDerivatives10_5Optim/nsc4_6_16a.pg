$h = random(2, 6,1);
$w =  random(2,7,1);
$theta = random(.3,1.4,.01);  #given angle for hint.

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A fence $h feet tall runs parallel to a tall building at a distance of $w feet from
the building. We want to find the  the length of the shortest ladder that will reach from the ground over the fence to the wall of the building.
$PAR
Here are some hints for finding a solution: $BR
Use the angle that the ladder makes with the ground to define the
position of the ladder and draw a picture of the ladder leaning against the wall of the building and just touching the top of the fence.
$PAR
If the ladder makes an angle $theta radians with the ground, touches the top
of the fence and just reaches the wall, calculate the distance along
the ladder from the ground to the top of the fence.
$BR \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR
The distance along the ladder from the top of the fence to the wall
is
$BR \{ans_rule(30)\} $BR

Using these hints write a function \(L(x)\) which gives the  total length of a ladder which touches
the ground at an angle \( x \), touches the top of the fence and
just reaches the wall.$BR
\(L(x)\) = \{ans_rule(30)\}.$BR

Use this function to find the length of the shortest ladder which will
clear the fence.$BR

The length of the shortest ladder is \{ans_rule(40) \} feet.
EOT

$theta =arctan( ( $h/$w ) **(1/3) );   # optimum angle
$ans = $w/cos($theta) + $h/(sin( $theta) );  # length of the ladder.
ANS(num_cmp($l1),num_cmp($l2));
ANS(fun_cmp("$h/sin(x)+$w/cos(x)"));
ANS(num_cmp($ans));
