BEGIN_TEXT
Centerville is the headquarters of Greedy Cablevision Inc. The
cable company is about to expand service to two nearby towns,
Springfield and Shelbyville.  There needs to be cable connecting
Centerville to both towns.  The idea is to save on the cost of
cable by arranging the cable in a Y-shaped configuation.
Centerville is located at
\(($a,0)\) in the \(xy\)-plane, Springfield is at \((0,$b)\), and
Shelbyville is at \((0,- $b)\). The cable runs from Centerville
to some point \((x,0)\) on the \(x\)-axis where it splits into two branches going to
Springfield and Shelbyville. Find the location \((x,0)\)
that will minimize the amount of cable between the 3 towns and
compute the amount of cable needed. Justify your answer.
$PAR
To solve this problem we need to minimize the following function
of \(x\):
$BR
\(f(x)=\)\{ans_rule(45)\}
$BR
We find that \(f(x)\) has a critical number at \(x=\)\{ans_rule()\}
$BR
To verify that \(f(x)\) has a minimum at this critical number we compute
the second derivative \(f''(x)\) and find that its value at the critical
number is \{ans_rule()\}, a positive number.
$BR
Thus the minimum length of cable needed is \{ans_rule()\}
