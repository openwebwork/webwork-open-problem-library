# TEXT( ... , ... , )
# Is the simplest way of printing text, each string in the input is immediately printed.
# It does not do any of the simplifying and evaluating tricks performed by the BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT construction.

# beginproblem() is a macro which outputs the string
# which contains the number
# of points the problem is worth.

# Putting these two ideas together prints the standard opening line of a problem.
# We will use this construction routinely at the beginning of all subsequent problems.

It's good practice to multiply at least one matrix solution out fully, to make sure that you
know how to do it, but you can get the other answers quickly by process of elimination and
just multiply out one row or one column.
