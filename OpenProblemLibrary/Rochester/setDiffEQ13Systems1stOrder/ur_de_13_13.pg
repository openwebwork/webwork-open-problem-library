$name opens a bank account with an initial balance of $b0 dollars. Let \(b(t)\) be the balance
in the account at time \(t\). Thus \(b(0)=$b0\). The bank is paying interest at a continuous
rate of $br$PERCENT per year. $name makes deposits into the account at a continuous rate of
\(s(t)\) dollars per year. Suppose that \(s(0)=$s0\) and that \(s(t)\) is increasing at a
continuous rate of $sr$PERCENT per year ($name can save more as his income goes up over time).
