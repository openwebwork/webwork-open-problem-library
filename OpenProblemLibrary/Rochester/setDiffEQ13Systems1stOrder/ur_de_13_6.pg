# TEXT( ... , ... , )
# Is the simplest way of printing text, each string in the input is immediately printed.
# It does not do any of the simplifying and evaluating tricks performed by the BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT construction.

# beginproblem() is a macro which outputs the string
# which contains the number
# of points the problem is worth.

# Putting these two ideas together prints the standard opening line of a problem.
# We will use this construction routinely at the beginning of all subsequent problems.

TEXT(beginproblem());

# Since this is a matching questions, we do not usually wish to tell students which
# parts of the matching question have been answered correctly and which are
# incorrect.  That is too easy.  To accomplish this we set the following flag to zero.

# Make a new match list

$ml = new_match_list();

# $ml ->rf_print_a(~~&print_eqn_a);
# $ml now "contains" the match list object.  (Actually $ml is a scalar variable which contains a pointer to
# the match list object, but you can think of the match list object as being shoe horned into the variable $ml.
# You need to remember that $ml contains (a pointer to) an object, and not ordinary data such as a number or string.

# Some people use the convention $o_ml to remind them that the variable contains an object, but for short problems
# that is probably not necessary.

# An object contains both data (in this case the list of questions and answers) and subroutines (called methods)
# for manipulating that data.

# Insert some  questions and matching answers in the q/a list by calling on the objects qa method.
# using the construction $ml ->qa(..list of alternating questions and matching answers ...).
# Think of this as asking the object $ml to store the  matching questions
# and answers given in the argument to the method qa.

Match the differential equations and their vector valued function solutions: $BR

know how to do it, but you can get the other answers quickly by process of elimination and
just multiply out one row element.
