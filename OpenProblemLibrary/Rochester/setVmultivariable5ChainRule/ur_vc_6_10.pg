BEGIN_TEXT
In a simple electric circuit, Ohm's law states that \( V = IR \), where V is the
voltage in volts, I is the current in amperes, and R is the resistance in ohms.
Assume that, as the battery wears out, the voltage decreases at $frac_a volts
per second and, as the resistor heats up, the resistance is increasing at
$frac_b ohms per second. When the resistance is $hundred_c ohms and the current
is $frac_d amperes, at what rate is the current changing?
  $PAR
\{ans_rule(35)\} amperes per second
