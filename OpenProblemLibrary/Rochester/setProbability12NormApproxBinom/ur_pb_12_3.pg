An airline company is considering a new policy of booking as many as $b persons on an
airplane that can seat only $s. 
(Past studies have revealed that only $p$PERCENT of the booked passengers actually arrive for the flight.)
Estimate the probability that if the company books $b persons. not enough seats will be 
available. $BR
