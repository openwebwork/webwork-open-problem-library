Suppose that from the past experience a professor knows that the test score of a student taking his final examination is a random variable
with mean \($mean\) and standard deviation \($dev.\) How many students would have to take the examination to ensure, with probability at
least \($p\), that the class average would be within \($a\) of \($mean\)? $BR
