BEGIN_TEXT
A soft drink bottler purchases glass bottles from a vendor.  The bottles are required to have an internal
pressure of at least \(150\) pounds per square inch (psi).  A prospective bottle vendor claims that its
production process yields bottles with a mean internal pressure of \(157\) psi and a standard deviation of
\(3\) psi.  The bottler strikes an agreement with the vendor that permits the bottler to sample from the
production process to verify the claim.  the bottler randomly selects \($n\) bottles from the last
\(10000\) produced, measures the internal pressure of each, and finds the mean pressure for the sample to
be \($a\) psi below the process mean cited by the vendor. $PAR
(a) Assuming that the vendor is correct in his claim, what is the probability of obtaining a sample mean
this far or farther below the process mean? $BR
\{ans_rule(20)\} $PAR
(b) If the standard deviation were \(3\) psi as claimed, but the mean was \($mean1 \) psi, what is the
probability of obtaining a sample mean of \($x\) psi or below?$BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
(c) If the process mean were \(157\) psi as claimed, but the standard deviation was \($sd\) psi, what is
the probability of obtaining a sample mean of \($x\) psi or below? $BR
\{ans_rule(20)\}
