BEGIN_TEXT

Scores for men on the verbal portion of the SAT-I test are normally distributed with a mean of \( 509 \) and a standard deviation of \( 112\). $BR


(a) \( \) If \(1\) man is randomly selected, find the probability that his score is at least \( $score\).$BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

(b) \( \) If \($n\) men are randomly selected, find the probability that their mean score is at least \( $score\). $BR

\{ans_rule(10)\} $BR

\($n\) randomly selected men were given a review course before taking the SAT test. If their mean score is \( $score\), is there
a strong evidence to support the claim that the course is actually effective? $BR

(Enter YES or NO) \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\}
