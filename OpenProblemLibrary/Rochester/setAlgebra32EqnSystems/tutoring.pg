BEGIN_TEXT;
Charlie is trying to allocate his study time this weekend.  He can spend time 
working with either his math tutor or his chemistry tutor to prepare for next 
week's tests.  His math tutor charges $DOLLAR $mathcost per hour.  His chemistry
tutor charges $DOLLAR $chemcost per hour.  He has $DOLLAR $money to spend on
tutoring, but each hour with the math tutor requires $mathasp aspirin and 
$mathsleep hours of sleep to recover.  Each hour with the chemistry tutor 
requires $chemasp aspirin and $chemsleep hour of sleep to recover.  Charlie
has only $aspirin aspirin left, and can only afford to sleep for $sleep hours 
this weekend.  If each hour of math tutoring will improve his grade by $math 
points and each hour of chemistry tutoring will improve his grade by $chem 
points, how many hours should he spend with each tutor in order to improve his 
grades the most?
$BR
$BR
Charlie should spend \{ans_rule(10)\} hours with his math tutor and 
\{ans_rule(10)\} hours with his chemistry tutor to improve his grades by a 
total of \{ans_rule(10)\} points.
