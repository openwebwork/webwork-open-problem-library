BEGIN_TEXT
This question concerns bit strings of length six. These bit strings 
can be divided up into four types depending on their initial and 
terminal bit. Thus the types are: 0XXXX0, 0XXXX1, 1XXXX0, 1XXXX1. $BR
How many bit strings of length six must you select
before 
you are sure to have at least \( $a \) that are of the same type? (Assume
that when you select bit strings you always select different
ones from ones you have already selected.) $BR
