BEGIN_TEXT
Two six-sided dice are rolled (one red one and one green one). 
Some possibilities are (Red=1,Green=5) or (Red=2,Green=2) etc. $BR
(a) How many total possibilities are there? $BR
\{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
$BR
For the rest of the questions, we will assume that the dice are fair and
that all of the possibilities in (a) are equally likely. 
$BR
$BR
(b) What is the probability that the sum on the two dice comes out 
to be $a1? 
$BR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$BR
(c) What is the probability that the sum on the two dice comes out 
to be $a2? $BR
Answer: \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR
$BR
(d) What is the probability that the numbers on the two dice are equal?
$BR
Answer: \{ ans_rule(20) \}
