BEGIN_TEXT
A coin is tossed twice. Let \(E\) be the event "the first toss
shows heads" and \(F\) the event "the second toss shows heads.
$BR
(a) Are the events \(E\) and \(F\) independent?
$BR
Input Yes or No here: \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(b) Find the probability of showing heads on both toss.
$BR
Input your answer here: \{ans_rule(25) \}
