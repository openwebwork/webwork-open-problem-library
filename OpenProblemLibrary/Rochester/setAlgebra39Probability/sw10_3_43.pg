BEGIN_TEXT
A jar contains $a red marbles numbered 1 to $a and $b blue marbles numbered 1
to $b. A marble is drawn at random from the jar. 
Find the probability of the given event.
$BR
(a) The marble is red;
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(b) The marble is odd-numbered;
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(c) The marble is red or odd-numbered;
$BR
Your answer is : \{ans_rule(25) \}
$BR
(d) The marble is blue or even-numbered;
