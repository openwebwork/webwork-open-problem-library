BEGIN_TEXT
An open box is to be made from a flat piece of material $a inches long and 
$b inches wide by cutting equal squares of length \(x \) from the corners 
and folding up the sides. 
$BR $BR 
Write the volume \(V \) of the box as a function of \(x \).  Leave it as a product of factors,
do not multiply out the factors.
$BR
\(V(x) =\) \{ ans_rule(30)\}
$BR $BR
If we write the domain of \(V(x)\) as an open interval in the form \( (a,b) \),
then what is \(a \)?    
        $BR
        \(a =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
and what is \(b \)?  
        $BR
        \(b =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
