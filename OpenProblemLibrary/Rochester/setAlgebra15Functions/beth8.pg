BEGIN_TEXT
A company that makes thing-a-ma-bobs has a start up cost of ${DOLLAR}$a.  
It costs the company ${DOLLAR}$b to make each
thing-a-ma-bob and the company charges ${DOLLAR}$c for each thing-a-ma-bob.  
Let \(x\)
represent the number of thing-a-ma-bobs made.
$BR
$BR
Write the cost function for this company.
        \(C(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR
Write the revenue function for this company.
	\(R(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR
Write the profit function for this company.
        \(P(x) = R(x) - C(x)\) = \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
$BR
What is the minimum number of thing-a-ma-bobs that the company must pruduce and sell to make a profit?
$BR
         Answer = \{ans_rule(40)\}
