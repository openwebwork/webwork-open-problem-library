BEGIN_TEXT
Fuzzy sets are used in artificial intelligence. Each element in the universal
set \(U\) has a degree of membership, which is a real number between \(0\) and
\(1\) ( including \(0\) and \(1\) as possiblilities), in a fuzzy set \(S\), The
fuzzy set \(S\) is denoted by listing the elements with their degrees of
membership (elements with \(0\) degree of membership are not listed).$PAR For
example, we write
\(F = \lbrace $a\ Alice, $b\ Brian, $c\ Rita, $d\ Oscar, $e\ Fred \rbrace \)
for the (fuzzy) set \(F\) of famous people to indicate that Alice has a \($a\)
degree membership to \(F\), that Brian has a \($b\) membership to \(F\) and so
on. ( Thus for example Brian is the most famous of these people while Oscar is
the least famous. )$PAR Also suppose that \(R\) is the (fuzzy) set of rich
people given by \(R = \lbrace $a2\ Alice, $b2\ Brian, $c2\ Rita, $d2\ Oscar, $e2\ Fred \rbrace \). The complement of a fuzzy set\(\ S\) is the fuzzy set \( \overline{S}\),
where the degree of memebership of an element in \( \overline{S}\) is \(1\)
minus the degree of membership of that element in \(S\).$PAR Thus for example we
have:$PAR \( \overline{F} =\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Alice,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Brian,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Rita,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Oscar,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Fred \).$PAR The intersection of two fuzzy sets \(S\) and \(T\) is the fuzzy set \(S
\cap T\), where the degree of membership of an element in \(S \cap T\) is the
minimum of the degrees of membership of this element in \(S\) and in \(T\). Thus
the fuzzy set \( F \cap R \) of the rich and famous people is:$PAR \(F \cap R = 
\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Alice,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Brian,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Rita,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \(Oscar,\) \{ans_rule(5)\} \( Fred \).$PAR
