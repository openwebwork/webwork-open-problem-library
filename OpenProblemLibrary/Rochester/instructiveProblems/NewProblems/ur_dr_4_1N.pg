$a = random(1,10,1);
$c = random(1,10,1);
do {$d = random(1,10,1);} until($d != $c);  # picks $d not equal to $c

#    Creates a function with respect to x (x is the default variable enabled), 
#  and does basic fixes to it via 'reduce'; i.e. (-1)*x-> -x, (x + 0) -> x, etc.
       $Funct = Formula("($a*sin(x))/($c*sin(x) + $d*cos(x))")->reduce;

#  Takes derivative of $Funct with respect to x.
       $deriv = $Funct->D; 

#  Evaluates $deriv at x = $n
       $m = $deriv->eval(x=>($n->eval));

#    Compute preserves the numeric structure of the inside as far as using 
#  it as a correct answer.  
#    For example, $answer = Compute("9 - (3 * 8)"); ... ANS($answer->cmp); 
#  will compare -15 to the student's answer, but will display "9 - (3 * 8)" 
#  as the correct answer.
       $b = Compute(($Funct->eval(x=>($n->eval)))-($m)*($n));

       $TangentLine = Formula("$m*x + $b");
