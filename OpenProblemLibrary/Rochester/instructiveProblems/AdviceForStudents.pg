"$ITEM Always go to class and take good notes.",
"$ITEM Read each section in the text before it is covered in class,
since you will be lost if you can't follow the instructor.",
"$ITEM Do the homework the day of the lecture or the next day (don't
procrastinate).",
"$ITEM Print a copy of each homework (WebWork), do all of the homework
thoroughly, write out all of the details, keep it organized, and use
it to help you study.",
"$ITEM Do the supplementary homework exercises to help you prepare for
recitation / quiz / workshop and exams.",
"$ITEM Visit LAS and join a study group.",
"$ITEM If you don't understand something, ask right away.",
"$ITEM Learn from your mistakes. Go over tests and look at solutions
until you know what you did wrong and understand the solution.",
"$ITEM Figure everything out rather than memorizing.",
"$ITEM Arrange your schedule so that you have enough time every week
to study and do homework.",

"$ITEM Start studying for exams early. You can't just study the night
before and do well.  Get plenty of rest the night before an exam.",
"$ITEM Don't stress out and don't give up.",
"$ITEM Be sure to really know those trig functions.  Learn the unit
circle.",
"$ITEM During class, view the examples seriously, and copy them
quickly in detail.",
"$ITEM Read the section before coming to class, it will help a
lot. Ask lots of questions in class.",
"$ITEM Go to each and every class. If you don't understand something,
try reading the book. Learn how to write good notes.",
"$ITEM Do not depend on your instructor to teach you everything.  Work
hard on your own, work with friends, join an LAS study group, visit
the math study hall in Hylan 1103 (Tuesdays and Thursdays
approximately 9-5), and possibly hire a tutor.",
"$ITEM Be prepared for class: read over the section an attempt to work
a couple of problems before you go to class ... review your notes
after class, and don't put off doing homework.",
"$ITEM This is a very difficult and time-consuming course. Expect a
lot of time to be spend on homework assignment, and take advantage of
office hours. Attend classes: every lecture helps.",
"$ITEM The biggest piece of advice I can give future calculus students
is to make sure that their schedules permit them a sufficient amount
of time every week to study and do homework. By this I mean at least
eight to ten hours. This was something I didn't do and I got really
overtired and stressed because of it.",

"$ITEM I think it is good to find people you can trust and rely on as
good friends and study partners. Being in a group makes studying
easier and more fun.",
"$ITEM Don't give up. Eventually the answers will come to you, and if
not, don't be afraid to ask. The math study hall in Hylan 1103
(Tuesdays and Thursdays approximately 9-5) is great and they're very
helpful. Students should also form study groups and meet with them on
a regular basis. AND DON'T STRESS OUT.",
"$ITEM Keep up on the homework: do not let yourself go behind. If you
get confused by something, get help then: don't wait until the exam to
learn what you did not understand. There is tutoring help for a
reason. Do not feel stupid going to it. If you do not go there, get
help from the teacher, a fellow classmate, or a friend. DO NOT GIVE
UP!",
"$ITEM Start studying for the exams early. Do good on the beginning
chapters: the chapters become harder and harder, so it's
best if you ace your exams in the beginning. It's not like high
school: you can't just study the night before and ace the test.",
"$ITEM Remain focused no matter what do you or what grade you
get. College is tough: you may hit a few bumps on the road, but keep
trucking.",
"$ITEM Get enough sleep before the test, and always take advantage of
the full time period allotted for the test.",
"$ITEM Sleep well before tests, even more than eight hours if you can,
and eat within three hours before the test.",
"$ITEM The more and closer to the test you cram, the worse your grades
will be.",
"$ITEM Start studying for tests at least three or four days before the
actual test.  Don't cram!",
"$ITEM Always do the supplementary homework problems before quizzes.
They help a lot!",

"$ITEM The best advice I can give to future calculus students is to
get ahead in their work. By getting ahead, they will be prepared in
class to ask questions about the homework or about information in
general. Any concepts that aren't understood can be explained further
in class: you don't want to find at 10 pm the night before the test
that there's a concept that you don't understand.",
"$ITEM Do NOT procrastinate! I would recommend doing homework early
and have as much time as possible to do it.",
"$ITEM Don't wait until the night before it's due to do the homework:
do it the day of the lecture or the next day, when the material is
still fresh.",
"$ITEM Don't wait until the last minute to do homework: putting it off
to the night before is not cool! And don't put it off because you
don't understand it! Don't be afraid to ask questions either! Study
groups kind of help but be prepared to do more socializing than
studying!",
"$ITEM Be prepared to spend a lot of time on homework. Be ready to not
just do the homework for a grade, but to completely understand it. The
tutor labs are extremely helpful, and form study groups. And don't
stress out.",
"$ITEM Calculus I is definitely a very challenging course and there
are times you feel discouraged and let down ... In order to succeed in
this course, practice, practice, practice.  Do as many practice
problems as humanly possible. The practice problems really helped
me.",
"$ITEM Draw pictures even if you don't know how the graph will look or
if it is not required: it may keep you from making silly mistakes!",
"$ITEM Be prepared to spend many hours trying to understand what in
the world calculus is all about. ... luckily, it kind of comes
together at the end of the semester.",
"$ITEM Practice and working out problems are key to passing the class.
Do all the homework to the best of your ability, read through all the
chapters, and ask for all the help you can get.",
"$ITEM Read the book!  Do all the problems in the chapter, not just
the assigned ones.",

"$ITEM Don't slack off because if you get behind, it will be hard to
get caught up again and you will be confused.",
"$ITEM Keep on trying with hard problems: the answer will come sooner
or later.",
"$ITEM The best way to learn is to teach someone else, or say it aloud
to yourself (when no one is looking).  At a minimum I would do 15
hours of classwork outside of the classroom each week [this for a
4-hour calculus course].",
"$ITEM Take advantage of the homework and read the sections of the
book that the professor goes over.  Reading the sections, doing the
examples, and then doing the homework really helps you on the test.",
"$ITEM Do every odd-numbered problem in each section, and check your
answers.  Focus on the problems you missed, and work on them to get
the right answer.  The more problems you practice, the more you will
recognize patterns, and the tests will be simple for you.  Think of
mathematics as a foreign language: the more you immerse yourself in
it, the more natural it will become.",
"$ITEM Do the homework for each section the night that you go over it.
Waiting until you've covered something else will only confuse you.",
"$ITEM Do not allow yourself to become calculator-dependent during
your practice.",
"$ITEM Do at least an hour of homework every night of studying; spend
time on what you don't know and make sure you learn it before the
class meets next or else you are left behind.  It is better to be
ahead than to play catch-up during finals week.",
"$ITEM Learn to read graphs. Learn to live without your calculator.",
"$ITEM Learn why things are the way they are rather than just
memorizing how they are used. Memorize the derivative and integral
tables. Better yet, learn how to derive them.",

"$ITEM Don't rely on your graphing calculator to do limit problems.
I did, and, as a result, I did not know how to answer many exam 
questions.  Instead, learn the methods needed to evaluate limits
without a calculator."
