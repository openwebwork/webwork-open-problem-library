$PAR
Two boys on bicycles, $dist miles apart, began racing directly toward each other.  The instant they started, a fly on the handle bar of one bicycle started flying straight toward the other cyclist.  As soon as it reached the other handle bar it turned and started back.  The fly flew back and forth in this way, from handle bar to handle bar, until the two bicycles met.
$PAR
If each bicycle had a constant speed of $vel_bike miles an hour, and the fly flew at a constant speed of $vel_fly miles an hour, how far did the fly fly?

$answer = $vel_fly * $dist / (2 * $vel_bike);
