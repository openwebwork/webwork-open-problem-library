BEGIN_TEXT
This problem is an example of critically damped harmonic motion.
$PAR
A hollow steel ball weighing 4 pounds is suspended from a spring.
This stretches the spring \(\frac{1}{$ss} \) feet.

The ball is started in motion from the
equilibrium position
with a downward velocity of \($n \) feet per second.
The air resistance (in pounds) of the  moving ball 
numerically equals 4 times its
velocity (in feet per second) .
Suppose that after t seconds the ball is y feet below its rest position.
Find y in terms of t.$PAR
Take as the gravitational acceleration 32 feet
per second per second. (Note that the positive y direction is down in this problem.)

HINT(EV3(<<'EOF'));
When using English units (lb, ft, etc.) you need to be a bit careful with equations involving
mass. This is causing some confusion --- I hope this hint helps:
$PAR
Pounds (lb) is a unit of force, not mass.  Using \( mg=F \) and
\( g = 32\,\text{ft}/\text{sec}^2 \), we see that an object at the surface
of the earth that weighs 32 lbs (i.e. the force on it is 32 lbs)
will have a mass of 1 slug (the unit of mass in the English units is called
the slug -- really!)  So one slug weighs 32 lbs at the surface of the earth
(or \( 1\,\text{lb} = (1/32)\times\text{slug}\times\text{ft}/\text{sec}^2 \)).
$PAR
When using metric units, kilograms is a unit of mass, not force or weight.
A 1-kilogram mass will weigh \( 1 \times 9.8 \) newtons on the surface
of the earth.  (\( g = 9.8\,\text m/\text{sec}^2 \)
and \( \text{newton} = \text{kg} \times \text m/\text{sec}^2 \)).
$PAR
Saying that a mass ${LQ}weighs$RQ 1 kilogram is technically incorrect usage,
but it is often used.  What one really means is that it has 1 kilogram
of mass and therefore weighs 9.8 newtons.
