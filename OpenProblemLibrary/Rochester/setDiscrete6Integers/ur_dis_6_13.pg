BEGIN_TEXT
One's complement representations of integers are used to simplify computer 
arithmetic. To represent positive and negative integers with absolute
value less than \( 2^{n-1} \), a total of \( n \) bits is used. 
The leftmost bit is used to represent the sign: this bit is 0 for 
positive integers and 1 for negative integers. $BR

For positive integers, the remaining bits are identical to 
the binary representation of the integer. Thus using 4 bits, the 
One's complement representation of 5 is 0101. $BR

For negative integers, the remaining bits are found by first 
finding the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer 
and then taking the complement of each of these bits in the binary 
representation. (Thus 1's and 0's get switched) $BR

Thus for example using 4 bits, the One's complement representation of 
-5 is 1010, where the initial 1 is to indicate the sign, and the
subsequent 010 is the complement of 101 the binary representation of 5. $BR

Find the One's Complement representations, using bit strings of length
six, of the following integers. (Your answers must be bit strings of
length 6):
$BR 
(a) \( $a[0] \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} 
$PAR
(b) \( $a[1] \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} 
$PAR
(c) \( -$a[2] \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} 
$PAR
(d) \( -$a[3] \) \{ ans_rule(20) \} 
$PAR
