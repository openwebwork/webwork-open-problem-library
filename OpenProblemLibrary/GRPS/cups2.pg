>> [!An image of a polystyrene cup!]{'cup.jpg'}{200} <<

Stackable polystyrene cups have a height
[` h_{1}  = [$hc1] `] cm.

* Two stacked cups have a height of [` h_{2} = [$hc2] `] cm.
* Three stacked cups have a height of [` h_{3} = [$hc3] `] cm.

a) Find the linear model for the height, where [`x`] is the number of cups:  [` h(x) = `][_]{$linear_model}


b) If your friend is [` [$c] `] cm tall, how many complete cups you will need to reach at least the height of your friend. [_]{$cups}

    ? 'The number of cups is [$cups]'
    : 'Since the number of cups is not an integer, round up to [$cups].';

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) First, find the linear model for the height. This will be [` h(x) = mx +b `].  We need two points on this line and can use [`(2,[$hc2])`] and [`(3,[$hc3])`]. The slope using these are
    [``` m = \frac{[$hc3]-[$hc2]}{3-2} = [$b] ```].
    Using the point [`(2,[$hc2])`], substitute this and the slope into the linear model to get
    [``` h(2) = [$hc2] = [$b] \cdot 2 + b ```]
    and solving for [`b`] to get [`b=[$a]`].  The model is
    [``` h(x) = [$b] x + [$a] ```]

b) In this case, we will substitute [` h(x) = [$c]`] and solve for [`x`]
    [``` [$c] = [$b] x + [$a] ```]
    subtract [$a] from both sides
    [``` [@ $c-$a @] = [$b] x ```]
    divide by [$b] to get
    [``` [@ ($c-$a)/$b @] = x ```]
