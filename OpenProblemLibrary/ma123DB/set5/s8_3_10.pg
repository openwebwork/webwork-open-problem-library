BEGIN_TEXT

The Deligne Dam on the Cayley River is built so that the
wall facing the water is shaped like the region above the curve
\( y=$a x^2  \) and below the line \( y= $b \).  (Here, distances
are measured in meters.)  The water level is \( $c \) meters
below the top of the dam.  Find the force (in Newtons) exerted
on the dam by water pressure. $BR$BR

$BITALIC (Water has a density of \(1000 \textrm{kg}/\textrm{m}^3\), and the acceleration of gravity is \(\displaystyle 9.8 \textrm{m}/\textrm{sec}^2 .\) ) $EITALIC
