BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the experiment where a pair of fair dice is thrown.  
$BR
Let $BBOLD X $EBOLD denote the random variable whose
$BR
value is determined by taking the maximum of the spots showing on 
$BR
either of the two dice thrown. 
$BR
For example, if a 3 and a 5 were thrown, then $BBOLD X $EBOLD would
$BR
take the value of Maximum(3,5) = 5.  
$BR
The range of values that $BBOLD X $EBOLD can assume are the 
$BR
positive integers {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
$BR 
Please give the corresponding probabilities for the values 
$BR
of $BBOLD X $EBOLD given below.
$BR
Pr(X = 1) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 2) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 3) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 4) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 5) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 
$BR
Pr(X = 6) = \{ans_rule(10)\} 

$PAR
Further, find the probability that $BBOLD X $EBOLD is divisible by $remult.
$BR
Probability that $BBOLD X $EBOLD is divisible by $remult equals \{ans_rule(10)\}
