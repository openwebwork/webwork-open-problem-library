BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose an arc is intercepted by a central angle of \( \theta \) radians in a circle
of radius r.  The chord associated with that arc is the straight line segment joining 
the endpoints of the arc.  The length of the chord, c, is given by
$BR
\( c = r\sqrt{2-2 \cos( \theta)} \)
$BR
A manufacturer of stop signs packs the signs into a circular drum, so that the signs 
fit snugly.  Determine the radius of the drum given that length of each edge (chord) 
of the stop signs is $a inches.  (Recall that stop signs are regular octagons, 
8-sided polygons with all sides and angles congruent.)
$BR
\{ans_rule(20) \} inches
