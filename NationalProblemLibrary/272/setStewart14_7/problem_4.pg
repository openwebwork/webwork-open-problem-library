BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

Using the contour plot from problem 3 on page 947, section 14.7 (page 981, section 15.7) of your text, 
characterize the two critical points of the function by looking at the
contour plot.  You should be able to do this analysis without
computing derivatives, but you may want to compute them to corroborate
your intuition.

The critical point (1,1) is a \{ans_rule(30)\}$BR
(Use one of the expressions (without the quotes) ``local minimum",  ``local maximum", ``saddle point", ``cannot be determined")
$PAR
The second critical point is at (\{ans_rule(10)\}, \{ans_rule(10)\}),
and it is a \{ans_rule(30)\}

$BR (local minimum, local maximum, saddle point,
cannot be determined)


 $PAR

    ANS(str_cmp("local minimum"));

        ANS(num_cmp(0));
