BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

Find the volume of the largest rectangular box with edges parallel to
the axes that can be inscribed in the ellipsoid
\[
    \frac{x^2}{\{$a**2\}} + \frac{y^2}{\{$b**2\}} + \frac{z^2}{\{$c**2\}} = 1
\]

Hint: By symmetry, you can restrict your attention to the first octant
(where \(x, y, z \ge 0 \)), and assume your volume has the form \( V =
8xyz\).  Then arguing by symmetry, you need only look for points which
achieve the maximum which lie in the first octant.

Maximum volume: \{ans_rule(30)\}
