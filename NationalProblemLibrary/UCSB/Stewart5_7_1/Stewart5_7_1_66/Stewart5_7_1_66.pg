Let \(I_n = \int_{0}^{\,\pi/2} {\sin^n(x)}\,dx.\)

One can show that
\[I_{2n+2} \le I_{2n+1} \le I_{2n}\]
and (by using Exercise 44 in Section 7.1 of Stewart's book)
\[\frac{I_{2n+2}}{I_{2n}} = \frac{2n+1}{2n+2}.\]
These two facts can then be used to show that
\[\frac{2n+1}{2n+2} \le \frac{I_{2n+1}}{I_{2n}} \le 1\]
and deduce that
\[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{I_{2n+1}}{I_{2n}} = 1.\]
This formula and Exercise 43 and 44 in Section 7.1 of Stewart's text can then be used to prove that
\[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac{2n}{2n-1} \cdot \frac{2n}{2n+1} = \frac{\pi}{2}.\]
This formula is usually written as an infinite product
\[\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \cdots\]
and is called the $BITALIC Wallis product $EITALIC.  $BBOLD You should work through the above description to make sure that you understand what is going on! $EBOLD

We construct rectangles as follows.  Start with a square of area 1 and attach rectangles of area 1 alternately beside or on top of the previous rectangle (see the figure).  Find the limits of ratios of the width to the height of these rectangles.

\{ image( $pictID1, height => 357, width => 529, tex_size=>300 )  \}

$PAR
Limiting ratio of width to height is \{ans_rule(25)\}
