$BR

A cup of coffee at $initial degrees is poured into a mug and left in a
room at $ambient degrees.  After $time1 minutes, the coffee is
$second_temp degrees.  Assume that the differential equation describing
Newton's Law of Cooling is (in this case)
\(\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-$ambient)\).

$PAR
What is the temperature of the coffee after \{$time1 + 10\} minutes?

$BR
\{ans_rule(30)\}

$PAR
After how many minutes will the coffee be 100 degrees?
$BR
\{ans_rule(30)\}
