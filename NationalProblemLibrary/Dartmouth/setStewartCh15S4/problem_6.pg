BEGIN_TEXT
$BR

Use differentials to estimate the amount of material in a closed
cylindrical can that is $h cm high and $d cm in diameter if the metal
in the top and bottom is $end_thickness cm thick, and the metal in the
sides is $side_thickness cm thick.  Note, you are approximating the
volume of metal which makes up the can (i.e. melt the can into a blob
and measure its volume), not the volume it encloses.
$BR
The differential for the volume is
$BR
    \(dV = \) \{ans_rule()\} \(dr + \) \{ans_rule()\}\(dh\)
$BR
\( dr = \)\{ans_rule()\} and \(dh = \) \{ans_rule()\} (be careful)
$BR
The approximate volume of material is \{ans_rule()\} \(\textrm{cm}^3\).
