$BBOLD Functions. $EBOLD  Understand the concepts of domain, range, and 
inverse of a
function, and know how to evaluate and compose functions.


$BR

Let \[f(x) = \frac{x+5}{x+2}.\]

Then the domain of \(f\) is the set of all real numbers except
\{ ans_rule(10) \},  and its range is the set of all real numbers except
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\{ ans_rule(10) \}. 
$BR
Moreover,
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(1));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\(f(2) = \) \{ ans_rule(10) \}, 
$BR
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(7/4));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(f(t+1)= \)\{ ans_rule(10) \}, and
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(t+6)/(t+3)", [[0,5]], vars=>["t"]));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
$BR
\(f(f(t^2))\) = \{ ans_rule(30) \}.
$BR
This is hard to do in WeBWorK, but you should also be able to draw the
graph of \(f\), showing clearly all intercepts and asymptotes.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("(2t**2+5)/(t**2+3)", [[0,5]], vars=>["t"]));
