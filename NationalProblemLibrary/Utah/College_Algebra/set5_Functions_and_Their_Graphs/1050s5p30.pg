Enter below the definition of a function
that is both even and odd:

$BR
\(f(x) = \) \{ ans_rule(8) \}.


EOT
&ANS( multivar_function_cmp("0",["x"]));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD You might think of the circle.  That's a good
thought, but the circle does not define a function.  There is only one
function that is both even and odd. Go back to the definitions of $BITALIC
even $EITALIC and $BITALIC odd$EITALIC and see where they lead you.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD If \(f\) is both even and odd, then both
\(f(-x) = f(x)\) and \(f(-x) = -f(x)\) must be true.  Therefore we
must have \(f(x) = -f(x)\), for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f\).
There is only one number that equals its negative, and that is zero.  Thus
the only function that is both even and odd is \[f(x) = 0.\]
