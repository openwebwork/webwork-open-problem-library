TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In your summer home you have a fuel tank that is in the shape of a
pyramid sitting on its base. Its height is \(h\).  The depth
of the fuel when the tank is half full equals   \{ ans_rule(15) \}.
(Of course your answer will depend on \(h\).)

&ANS( multivar_function_cmp( "(1-2**(-1/3))*h",["h"]));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Apply the same ideas as in the previous problem.
The precise shape of the pyramid does not matter.  The volume of any
pyramid equals one third the area of the base multiplied with the
height.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Suppose the depth of the half full tank is
\(d\).  Then the empty upper part forms a similar pyramid with half
the volume of the overall pyramid. The volumes of similar pyramids relate like the cubes of their heights, and we have the equation

\[\frac{(h-d)^3}{h^3} = \frac{1}{2}.\]

We can solve this equation for \(d\), giving \[d =
\left(1-\frac{1}{\root 3 \of 2}\right)h.\] The factor multiplying
\(h\) in this formula equals approximately 0.2063.  (The corresponding
factor in the preceding problem was approximately 0.2929.)
