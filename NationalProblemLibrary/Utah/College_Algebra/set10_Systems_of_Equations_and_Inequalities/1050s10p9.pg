TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


You buy a total of \(4\) pounds of two kinds of candy.   One is for your
upcoming party  and costs $DOLLAR 2.- per pound.  However, you also
treat yourself to a fancy kind that costs $DOLLAR 10 per pound, to be
enjoyed in solitude.  You spend a total of $DOLLAR 12.- and buy
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} pounds of the gourmet candy.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Set up a system of two equations and solve it.
Of course nobody said that you have to buy an integer number of pounds
of candy.
EOT

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  If \(x\) is the number of pounds of fancy
candy and \(y\) the number of pounds of plain candy we have to solve
the two equations
\[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
x &+y& = & 4 \\
10x & + 2y &=& 12 \\
\end{array}
\]

This system has the solution \[x=\frac{1}{2} \quad\hbox{and}\quad y =
\frac{7}{2}.\]

$BR Alas, you can allow yourself only half a pound of that fancy candy.

$BR $BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Of course, you can also set up and solve a single
equation.  If you buy \(x\) pounds of fancy candy then you buy \(7-x\)
pounds of cheap candy and so you need to solve the equation
\[10x + 2(4-x) = 12\] which has the solution 
\(x=1/2\) as before.
