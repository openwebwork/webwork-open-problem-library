The solution of the linear system

\[
\begin{array}{rrrcl}
x & + y &+z & =& 2 \\
x & +2 y & -z &=& -1 \\
x & -3 y & +2z &=& 7 \\
\end{array}
\]
is

\(x=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}, 
EOT

&ANS( num_cmp(2));

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(y=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}, and
EOT

&ANS( num_cmp(-1));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
\(z=\) \{ ans_rule(10) \}.

$BR $BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Keep a careful record of your calculations since the
next problem differs from this one only in the right hand side, and
you don't want to redo your calculations.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
The calculations are summarized in the following table.  The numbers
of the equations are enclosed in parentheses.  For clarity zero entries are left blank.
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrr}
\hbox{Number} & x & y & z & \hbox{RHS} & \hbox{RS} \\
(1)              & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 5 \\
(2)              & 1 & 2 &-1 &-1 & 1 \\
(3)              & 1 &-3 & 2 & 7 & 7 \\
(4) = (2) - (1)  &   & 1 &-2 &-3 & -4 \\
(5) = (3) - (1)  &   &-4 & 1 & 5 & 2 \\
(6) = (5)+4(4)   &   &   & -7&-7 & -14 \\
\end{array}
\]

Equation \((6)\) reads \(-7z= -7\) and hence 
\[z = 1.\]
This turns equation \((5)\) into 
\(-4y +1 = 5\) and so 
\[y = -1.\]
From the first equation we obtain
\(x-1+1=2\) and so
\[x=2.\]

Substituting in the original equations shows that this is the correct solution.
