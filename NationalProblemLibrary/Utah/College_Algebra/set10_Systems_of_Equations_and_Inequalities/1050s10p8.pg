TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 


A group of eight people goes to the movies.  Tickets are $DOLLAR 6.-
each for adults and $DOLLAR 3 each for kids.  Together they pay
$DOLLAR 33.- for the tickets. There are 
 \{ ans_rule(10) \} adults in that group

and  \{ ans_rule(10) \} kids.


EOT

ANS(num_cmp(5));



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD If \(x\) is the number of adults and \(y\)
the number of kids then we have the two equations
\[\begin{array}{rrcl}
x & +y & = & 8 \\
6x & +3y & = & 33.\\
\end{array}
\]

The solution of that system is \[x=3\quad\hbox{and}\quad y = 5.\]
There are three adults and five kids.
