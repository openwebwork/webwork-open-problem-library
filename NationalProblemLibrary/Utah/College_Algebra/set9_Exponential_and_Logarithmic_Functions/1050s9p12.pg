Again, let 
 \[P = 2^{$p}-1.\]

Suppose you have traveled to a faraway place where the base of the
number system is \(37\).  (The inhabitants of that country are fond of
prime numbers.)  So it has 37 symbols in place of our 10 digits, but
otherwise it works just like the decimal system.  Expressed in that
system, \(P\) has
\{ ans_rule(10) \} digits.

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint: This works just like problem 22 of the previous
set, except that in place of the number \(10\) you use the number \(37\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT')); 
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD We compute the base \(37\) logarithm of
\(P\):

\[\log_{37} P = \frac{$p\times \ln 2}{\ln 37} \approx
 $digs.\]

Just as in the decimal system, the number of base \(37\) digits of
\(P\) is one more than the integer part of that logarithm, i.e., it is
\($dig.\)
