$BR 
You buy a pot and its lid for a total of $DOLLAR 11.  The sales
person tells you that the pot by itself costs $DOLLAR 10 more than
the lid.  The price of the pot is $DOLLAR \{ ans_rule(20) \} and

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD  Most people start out by guessing that the price
of the pot is $DOLLAR 10, and that of the $DOLLAR 1.  Then the
total price is indeed $DOLLAR 11, but the difference between the
price of the pot and that of the lid is only $DOLLAR 9, not $DOLLAR 10!
Well, since the difference is too small we need to make the
price of the lid less, and that the of the pot more.  The correct
answer is that the price of the pot is $DOLLAR 10.5, and that of
the lid $DOLLAR 0.5.
