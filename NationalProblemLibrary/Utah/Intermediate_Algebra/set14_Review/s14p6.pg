\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/ineq/index.html",
"Inequalities")\} are solved like equations, by figuring out what
bothers us and getting rid of it by doing the same thing on both sides
of the inequality.  The only difference is that when multiplying with a
negative factor we $BBOLD reverse $EBOLD the inequality.  Thus we replace
\(<\) with \(>\), \(\leq\) with \(\geq\), etc.

$BR
The solutions of the inequality
\[\frac{5-2x}{3} < 7 \]
satisfy 
$BR
\(x\)\{ ans_rule(3) \} ~
EOT
&ANS(str_cmp(">"));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
\{ ans_rule(20) \}.  
$BR 
(Enter "\(<\)" or "\(>\)"  and a rational number.)
EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(-8));


SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD


We proceed much like we would if this was an equality, except
that we reverse the inequality when multiplying on both sides with a
negative number: 

\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
  \frac{5-2x}{ 3}  & \lt & 7   & \big|\quad  \times 3   \\
  5-2x  & \lt & 21   & \big|\quad  -5   \\
  -2x  & \lt & 16   & \big|\quad  \div(-2)   \\
  x  & \gt & -8   & \big|\quad \mbox{the solution}   \\
\end{array}
\]
