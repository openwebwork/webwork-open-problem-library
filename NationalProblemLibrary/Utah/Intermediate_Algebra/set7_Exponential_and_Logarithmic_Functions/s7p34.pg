TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
You have two boxes of the same shape that hold flour.  The larger box
holds twice as much flour as the smaller one.  You conclude that it
would take you \{ ans_rule(10) \} times as much paint to paint the larger box
than it would take you to paint the smaller box.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
 This problem is very similar to the preceding one.  In this case,
the volume is multiplied with 2, and hence the
linear dimensions are multiplied with 
\(2^{\frac{1}{3}}\).  The areas are multiplied with the square of
that power, or
\[2^{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 1.587.\] Again, it does not matter whether 
you paint just the inside, the inside and the outside, or just the
lid, as long as you treat both boxes equally.
