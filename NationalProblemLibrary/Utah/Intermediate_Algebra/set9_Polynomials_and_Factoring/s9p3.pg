TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); 
You are flying in an open plane at an altitude of $h
feet and you drop a Coca Cola bottle out of the window.  The bottle will
hit the ground after \{ ans_rule(10) \} seconds. (Note: this problem
is a bit unrealistic since it ignores air drag.  The scenario
described here provides the opening scene in the movie "The Gods must
be crazy.")

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
When the bottle hits the ground its height is zero. When the
pilot drops the bottle out of the plane its vertical velocity is zero.
We set \(h\) to zero in the 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/gravity",
"formula for height:")\}
\(0 = $h - 16t^2.\)
Thus \(t = \sqrt{\frac{$h}{16}} = $t\) seconds.
