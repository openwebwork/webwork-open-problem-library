TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

$BR 

 The equation \[|x-1| + |x-2| + |x-3| = 4.\]

$BR
has two solutions.  Enter the smaller here
\{ ans_rule(20) \}


EOT

&ANS(num_cmp(2/3));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
and the larger here:
\{ ans_rule(20) \}



EOT
&ANS(num_cmp(10/3));


TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:  You don't want to write down all eight 
sign combinations of the absolute value. Assume first that the expressions
of which you take the absolute values are all positive, i.e., \(x>3\).
EOT



SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD If \(x>3\) then the equation turns into 
\[x-1+x-2+x-3=3x-6=4\] which has the solution \(x=\frac{10}{3}\).  The equation is
clearly symmetric about \(x=2\) so the second solution is \(x=
\frac{2}{3}.\) 
This argument may seem an audacious leap of imagination to you, but
you can find the same solution by supposing that \(x<1\).
