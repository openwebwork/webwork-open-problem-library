TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Your banker tells you that your (one time) investment will
double every 12 years.  You figure that the effective annual
interest rate is
\{ ans_rule(15) \} percent.  The effective annual interest rate is
the profit you obtain at the end of each of year, figured as a
percentage.  Of course you realize that each year you receive interest
also for the interest earned in the preceding years.

&ANS(num_cmp((2**(1/12)-1)*100));

TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR Hint:
Call the unknown interest rate \(p\).  Every year you multiply your
capital with \((1+p/100)\).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD
Let's denote the required interest rate by \(p\).  Then each year we
multiply the current principal with \(\left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)\).
Thus we have to solve the equation \[\left(1+\frac{p}{100}\right)^{12}
= 2.\] We solve this as we always do, getting rid of what bothers us
by doing the same thing on both sides of the equation.  In this case
we take to the power \(\frac{1}{12}\), subtract 1, and multiply with
100.  Carrying out this plan gives
\[p = \left(2^{\frac{1}{12}} - 1 \right)\times 100 \approx 5.95\char37.\]
