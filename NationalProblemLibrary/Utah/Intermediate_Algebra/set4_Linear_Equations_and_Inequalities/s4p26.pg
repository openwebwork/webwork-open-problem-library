$BR
This problem is just like the pot and lid problem on homework 1.

$BR
You buy a house including the land it sits on for $DOLLAR $sum.
The real estate agent tells you that the land costs $DOLLAR $diff more
than the house.

$BR 

The price of the house is $DOLLAR
\{ ans_rule(20) \} and
EOT
$answer = ($sum-$diff)/2;
ANS(num_cmp($answer));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
the price of the land is $DOLLAR
\{ ans_rule(20) \}.
EOT
$answer = ($sum+$diff)/2;
ANS(num_cmp($answer));
$H = ($sum-$diff)/2;

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));
$BR $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Let the price of the house be \(H\). 
Them the price of the land is \(H+  $diff\) and  we have the 
equation
\[H + (H+  $diff) =  $sum.\]  The solution of this equation 
is 
\[H =  $H\] and the land costs $DOLLAR $answer.
