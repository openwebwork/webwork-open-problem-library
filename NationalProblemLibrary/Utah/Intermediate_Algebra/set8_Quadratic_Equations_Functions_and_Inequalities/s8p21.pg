TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
In the next few problems of this set you are asked to solve 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/quadeq/",
"quadratic equations.")\}
These are of the form \[ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\] There are
usually two solutions that are either of the form \(r \pm s \) or of
the form \(r \pm s i\) where \(i^2 = -1\), and \(r\) and \(s\) are
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/numbers/",
"real numbers.")\}  Enter \(r\) and \(s\). Also enter "\(i\)" if the
solution is a 
\{htmlLink("http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/complex/",
"conjugate complex pair of numbers,")\} "\(1\)" if both
solutions are real, or "\(0\)" if there is only one real solution.
In the last case, also enter \(s=0\).

$BR
For example, the equation
\[x^2 + x + 1 = 0\]
has the solution
\[x=-1/2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i.\]
Enter \(-1/2\), \(\hbox{sqrt}(3)/2\), and \(i\) here:
$BR
\(x = \)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(\pm \)
EOT
ANS(num_cmp(-1/2));

ANS(num_cmp(sqrt(3)/2));
TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));

here.
EOT
ANS(fun_cmp("i", vars=>["i"]));


TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
The equation
\[x^2 + x -1 = 0\]
has the solution
\[x=-1/2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}.\]
Enter \(-1/2\), \(\hbox{sqrt}(5)/2\), and \(1\) here:
$BR
\(x = \)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(\pm \)
EOT

TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
$BR
The equation
\[x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} = 0\]
only has the solution
\[x=-1/2.\]
Enter \(-1/2\), \(0\), and \(0\) here:

\(x = \)\{ ans_rule(10) \} \(\pm \)
