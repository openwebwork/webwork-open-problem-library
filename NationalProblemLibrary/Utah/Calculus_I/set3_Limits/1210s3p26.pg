Let's now combine our rock tossing with a horizontal motion.  This
kind of problem can be handled by considering the vertical and
horizontal motions separately.  The horizontal velocity is
constant.  (Again, we ignore air resistance.)  Recall from your study of 
trigonometry that if you release a rock at a speed \(v\) in a direction that 
makes an angle \(\alpha\) with the horizontal, then the initial vertical 
velocity \(v_v\) and the horizontal velocity \(v_h\) are given by
\[v_v = v\sin\alpha \quad\hbox{and}\quad v_h = v\cos\alpha.\]


$BR
You shoot a rifle at an angle of $alpha degrees. The bullet leaves
your rifle at a height of 6 feet and a speed of $v feet per second.
It hits the ground after \{ ans_rule(20) \} seconds at a distance of

$BR Note: Again, ignore air resistance.
When shooting a rifle this is of course a gross simplification.  Even so, that's some rifle!
