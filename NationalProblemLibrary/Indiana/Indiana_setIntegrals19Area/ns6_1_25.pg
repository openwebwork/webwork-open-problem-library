$SOL $BR $BR

You can examine what this situation looks like by viewing the following graph:
$BR $graphtext $BR $BR

We note that the functions cross, and we need to calculate that point at which
they cross, so we can integrate on each side of it separately.  We need to do
those two integrals separately because in the once case one function is
greater, and in the other case the other function is greater.  This matters
because the integral will need to contain an expression of the difference
between the functions, so we'll need to know which is greater to decide in what
order to take that difference. $BR $BR

So we wish to discover the point at which \(y = $g \cos(x)\) crosses
\(y = $f \sin(x)\).  So we set them equal to one another and solve for \(x\):
	\[
	\begin{align*}
			$g \cos(x) = $f \sin(x)
		&\iff	\frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} = \frac{$f}{$g}	\\\\
		&\iff	\tan(x) = $soln_fog	\\\\
		&\iff	x = \tan^{-1}($soln_fog)
	\end{align*}
	\]
$BR $BR

So then we simply integrate from 0 to \(\tan^{-1}($soln_fog)\) in one section,
and then from there to \($a\pi\) in another section.  For ease of notation,
let's say \(C = \tan^{-1}($soln_fog)\).
\[
\begin{align*}
 &	\int_0^{C} ( $g \cos(x) - $f \sin(x) ) \; dx
		+ \int_{C}^{$a\pi} ( $f \sin(x) - $g \cos(x) ) \; dx	\\\\
=&	\left ( $g \sin(x) + $f \cos(x) ) \right|_0^{C}
		+ \left ( $g \sin(x) + $f \cos(x) ) \right|_{C}^{$a\pi}	\\\\
=&	$g \sin(C) + $f \cos(C) - $g \sin(0) - $f \cos(0) - $f \cos($a\pi)
		- $g \sin($a\pi) + $f \cos(C) + $g \sin(C)	\\\\
=&	$answer
\end{align*}
