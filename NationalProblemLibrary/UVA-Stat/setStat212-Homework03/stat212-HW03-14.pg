According to the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics, there are more 
than 63 million American workers 18 years old and over who use computers at work.  
From this study, which was conducted in 1994 and 1998 (Source: Statistical Abstract 
of the United States, 2000, Table 690), the following table of joint probabilities was developed.
