$PAR 
In early 2001, the United States Census Bureau started releasing 
the results of the latest census.  Among many other pieces of 
information, the bureau recoded the race or ethnicity of 
the residents of every county in every state.  From these 
results the bureau calculated a 'diversity index,' which 
measures the probability that two people chosen at random 
are of different races or ethnicities.  The census determined 
that in a county in Wisconsin, $a$PERCENT of its residents 
are white, $b$PERCENT are black, and $c$PERCENT are asian.  
Calculate the diversity index for this county.   
$PAR
Diversity Index = \{ans_rule(15)\}
