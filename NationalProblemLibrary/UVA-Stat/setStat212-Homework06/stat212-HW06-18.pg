$PAR
A bank wishing to increase its customer base advertises that it has 
the fastest service and that virtually all of its customers are served 
in less than $a minutes.  A management scientist has studied the service 
times and concluded that service times are exponentially distributed with 
a mean of $mu minutes.  Determine what the bank means when it claims 'virtually all' 
its customers are served in under $a minutes.

$PAR
Proportion of customers served in under $a minutes = \{ans_rule(15)\}
