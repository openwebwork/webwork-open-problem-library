$PAR
The top-selling Red and Voss tire is rated $a miles, which means nothing.  
In fact, the distance the tires can run until wear-out is a normally distributed random 
variable with a mean of $b miles and a standard deviation of $c miles.
$PAR
A.  What is the probability that the tire wears out before $a miles? 
$PAR 
Probability  =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
$PAR
B.  What is the probability that a tire lasts more than $d miles? 
$PAR 
Probability  =  \{ans_rule(15)\}
