$PAR
A manufacturer of light bulbs advertises that, on average, 
its long-life bulb will last more than $mu hours.  To test 
this claim,
 a statistician took a random sample of $samp bulbs and 
 measured the amount of time until each bulb burned out.  
 The mean 
 lifetime of the sample of bulbs is $xbar hours and has a 
 standard deviation of $sigma hours.  Can we conclude with $conf$PERCENT 
 confidence that the claim is true?  Fill in the requested information below.

$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD For the next part, your answer should use interval notation.  An
answer of the form \((-\infty, a)\) is expressed (-infty, a), an answer of the 
form \((b, \infty)\) is expressed (b, infty), and an answer of the 
form \((-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)\) is expressed (-infty, a)U(b, infty).
