BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose that the minimum and maximum ages for typical textbooks currently used in college 
courses are \(0\) and \(8\) years. Use the range rule of thumb to estimate the standard 
deviation.$BR

Standard deviation = \{ ans_rule(5) \} 

Find the size of the sample required to estimage the mean age of textbooks currently used 
in college courses. Assume that you want \( $p\)$PERCENT confidence that the sample 
mean is within \( $a \) year of the population mean.

Required sample size = \{ ans_rule(20) \}
