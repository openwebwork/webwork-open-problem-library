BEGIN_TEXT
It is necessary for an automobile producer to estimate the number of miles per gallon
achieved by its cars.  Suppose that the sample mean for a random sample of \($n \)
cars is \($mean\) miles and assume the standard deviation is \($sigma\) miles.  Now suppose
the car producer wants to test the hypothesis that \(\mu \), the mean number of miles
per gallon, is \($mu\) against the alternative hypothesis that it is not \($mu\). 
Conduct a test using \(\alpha = .05\) by giving the following:$PAR
(a) \( \ \) positive critical \(z\) score \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(b) \( \ \) negative critical \(z\) score \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
(c) \( \ \) test statistic \( \ \) \{ans_rule(10)\} $PAR
$PAR
\{ $mc->print_q() \}
$PAR
\{ $mc->print_a() \}
