This problem demonstrates a WeBWorK problem involving graphics. 

$PAR

The most important thing to remember when a problem contains a graphic is
that you can get a better look at it by clicking on the graphic.  This
will open a new window from your browser containing a enlarged version
of the picture.

$PAR

This will be a matching question.  Enter the letter of the graph of the function which corresponds to each statement.

Now that you have finished you can use the "Prob. List" button at the top of the page to return to the problem list page.  You'll see that the problems you have done have been labeled as correct or incorrect, so you can go back and do problems you skipped or couldn't get right the first time.  Once you have done a problem correctly it is ALWAYS listed as correct even if you go back and do it incorrectly later.  This means you can use WeBWorK to review course material without any danger of changing your grade.
