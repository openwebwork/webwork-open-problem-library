For the function \[  f(x)= \frac{($p1) }{($p2) ($p3)} ,\]
$BR
What are the vertical asymptotes?  Give a list of the \( x \)-values of the
asymptotes separated by commas.

	\(x =\) \{ ans_rule(10)\}
$BR 
$BR
What is the horizontal asymptote?
	$BR
	\(y = \)\{ ans_rule(10)\}

$BR
What are the \( x \) -intercepts?  Give a list of the 
\( x \) -intercepts separated by commas (i.e.:  (1,2),(3,4)). 
If there are no \(x\)-intercepts, type in $BITALIC none $EITALIC.
