If $a dollars is invested at an annual interest rate \(r\)
compounded monthly, the amount in the account at the end of $t
years is given by
\[  A = $a \left(1+\frac{1}{12}r\right)^{$c}.  \]
Find the rate of change of the amount \(A\) with respect to
the rate \(r\) for the following values of \(r\):

$PAR
\(r\) = $p1 percent: \{ans_rule(50)\}

$PAR
\(r\) = $p2 percent: \{ans_rule(50)\}
