A manufacture has been selling $a television sets a week at $DOLLAR$b each.
A market survey indicates that for each $DOLLAR$c rebate offered to a buyer,
the number of sets sold will increase by $d per week. 
$BR$BR
a) Find the function representing the demand \( p(x) \), where \( x \) is the number of the television sets sold per week and \( p(x) \) is the corresponding
price. $BR

b) How large  rebate should the company offer to a buyer, in order to
maximize its revenue? \{ans_rule(30) \} dollars $BR$BR
c) If the weekly cost function is \( $a1 + $a2 x \), how should it set
the size of the rebate to maximize its profit?
