One die is rolled. Let:     $BR  $BR

A = event the die comes up even  $BR
B = event the die comes up odd   $BR
C = event the die comes up 4 or more  $BR
D = event the die comes up at most 2   $BR
E = event the die comes up 3    $BR  $BR

Give your answer as "YES"  or "NO"  (without the quotations).
