A random sample of $n female cottonmouth snakes yielded a sample mean of $mean snakes per litter.  Assume that \(\sigma= 2.4 \).$PAR

a)  Use the data provided above to obtain an approximate 95.44$PERCENT confidence interval for the mean number of young per litter of all female cottonmouths. Confidence interval: (\{ans_rule(10)\}, \{ans_rule(10)\}). $BR
