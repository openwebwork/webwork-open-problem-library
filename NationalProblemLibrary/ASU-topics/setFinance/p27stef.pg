The Grand Prize in a State Lottery is $DOLLAR$A, which will be paid in 
20 equal annual payments of $DOLLAR$P each.
The State makes the first payment right away. How much does the State need to deposit
in an account paying $c$PERCENT compounded annually to be able to make the remaining
19 equal payments of $DOLLAR$P each?
$BR 
Answer =  $DOLLAR \{ans_rule(20)\}
