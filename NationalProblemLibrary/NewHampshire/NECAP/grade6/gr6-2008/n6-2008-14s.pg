BEGIN_TEXT
Sasha painted wooden cylinders and wooden cones.$PAR
She painted a total of 12 bases.$PAR
She painted the same number of cylinders as cones.$PAR
That means that she painted \{ans_rule(1)\} cones.


END_TEXT
ANS(Real(4)->cmp);
BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
A cylinder has 2 bases and a cone has 1 base.$BR
So, if \(n\) is the number of cones she painted $BR (and thus also the number of cylinders)$BR she painted  \(n\) cone bases and \(2n\) cylinder bases.$BR
So \(2n +n=3n=12\) and therefore \(n=4\).
$PAR
IN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NECAP EXAM YOU WERE EXPECTED $BR
 TO SHOW YOUR WORK.  SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTION $BR
 ABOVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
