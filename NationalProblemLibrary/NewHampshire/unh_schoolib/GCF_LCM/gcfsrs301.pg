For each of the following pairs of numbers, find the GCF.  [In more
advanced and college courses this will be called the GCD (greatest
common divisor) rather than GCF (greatest common factor)].

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
Sometimes it is easy to see the greatest common factor of two numbers.  $BR If you are trying a problem that does not look easy, it is often helpful to $BR just do it one piece at a time.  $PAR
Suppose you wanted to find GCF(120,168).  Well you can see that 2 divides both
$BR so put a 2 on your GCF list and divide the two numbers by 2 to see that you$BR
are now looking for GCF(60,84).  You might now notice either 2 or 4 is a factor of both.$BR  Suppose you noticed 4,  Put it on your GCF list and divide to see that$BR now you want GCF( 15,21).  Now you see 3, which you can put on your GCF list $BR and look for GCF(5,7).  But that is 1.  So you can multiply the numbers on your GCF list $BR to get \(2\times 4\times 3=24\) and so 24 is your GCF.
$PAR
If you have really unpleasant numbers to work with there is a clever procedure
called $BR the Euclidean Algorithm which is explained in one of the advanced 
problems and$BR is very efficient.
