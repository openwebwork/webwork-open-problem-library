BEGIN_TEXT
In a junior high school, 30% of the students in the Math Club are in $BR
the Science Club and 80% of the students in the Science Club are in $BR
the Math Club.  There are 15 students in the Science Club.  
$PAR
The number of students in the Math Club is \{ans_rule(2)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
The Science Club has 15 members.  80% of 15 is 12, so 12 members of the$BR Science Club are in the Math Club.  That means that 12 members of
the $BR Math Club are in the Science Club.  But since 12 is 30% of the
membership$BR Math Club, the number of members of the Math Club must
be $BR \(\frac{10}{3} \times 12=40\).
