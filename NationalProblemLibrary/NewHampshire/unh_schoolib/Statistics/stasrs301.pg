BEGIN_TEXT
Marietta and Patricia were planning a special dinner for their parents.$BR
They wanted to serve a grain or pasta.  At the supermarket they examined the $BR package labels and found these calories per serving size: $a for brown rice,
$b for orzo, $a for taboule, $c for kasha, $d for macaroni, $d for linguini, $c for white rice, and $c for vermicelli.$PAR

The mean of the data was \{ans_rule(2)\}
$PAR
The median of the data was \{ans_rule(2)\}
$PAR
The mode of the data was \{ans_rule(2)\}

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR Solution $PAR
To find the mean we take the sum of the eight numbers and divide by 8.
$PAR The numbers were $c, $c, $c, $a, $a, $d, $d, $b in increasing order of size.
$BR Since there are an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two$BR
 numbers in the middle, but both are $a, so the median is $a.
$PAR The mode is the number (or numbers) occurring most frequently.
