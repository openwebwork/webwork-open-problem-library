Solve the following equation in the interval [0, 2  \(\pi \)].
$BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD
Give the answer as a multiple of \( \pi \). 
Do not use decimal numbers. The answer should be a fraction or an integer.
Note that \( \pi\) is already included in the answer so you just have to
enter the appropriate multiple. E.g. if the answer is \( \pi/2 \) you should
enter  1/2.  If there is more than one answer enter them separated by commas.
$PAR

\( 2(\sin(t))^2-sin(t)-1=0 \)
$PAR
t = \{ans_rule(20) \}   \( \pi \)
