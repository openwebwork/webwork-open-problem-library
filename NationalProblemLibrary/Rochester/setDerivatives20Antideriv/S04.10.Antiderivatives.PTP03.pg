List corresponding features of the graphs of a function \( f \), its first derivative \( f' \), and (an) antiderivative \( F \).  Describe a strategy whereby, given a plot showing the graphs of \( f \), \( f' \), and \( F \), you can determine which is which.  Apply your strategy to identify the graphs A (blue), B (red) and C (green) as the graphs of a function \( f \), its first derivative \( f' \), and (an) antiderivative \( F \):$PAR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function \( f \). $PAR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of the function's first derivative \( f' \). $PAR
\{ans_rule(4)\} is the graph of an antiderivative of the function \( F \). $PAR
