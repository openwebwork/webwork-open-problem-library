$PAR
Consider two interconnected tanks as shown in the figure above. 
Tank 1 initial contains $water1 L (liters) of water
and $salt1 g of salt, while tank 2 initially contains $water2 L of water
and $salt2 g of salt.  Water containing $salt_concentration1 g/L of salt
is poured into tank1 at a rate of $flow_rate1 L/min while the mixture
flowing into tank 2 contains a salt concentration of $salt_concentration2 g/L of
salt and is flowing at the rate of $flow_rate2 L/min. 
The two connecting tubes have a flow rate of $tank1to2 L/min from
tank 1 to tank 2; and of $tank2to1 L/min from tank 2 back to tank 1. 
Tank 2 is drained at the rate of $flow_out2 L/min.
$PAR
You may assume that the solutions in each tank are thoroughly mixed
so that the concentration of the mixture leaving any tank along any
of the tubes has the same concentration of salt as the tank as a
whole. (This is not completely realistic, but as in real physics,
we are going to work with the approximate, rather than exact description. 
The 'real' equations of physics are often too complicated to even write
down precisely, much less solve.)
$PAR
How does the water in each tank change over time?
$PAR
Let \(p(t)\) and \(q(t) \) be the amount of salt in g at time t in tanks 1 and 2 respectively.
Write differential
equations for \( p \) and \( q \).
(As usual, use the symbols \(p\) and \(q\) rather than \(p(t)\) and \(q(t)\).)
$BR
\( p'= \) \{ ans_box(4,60) \}
$BR
\( q'= \) \{ ans_box(4,60) \}
