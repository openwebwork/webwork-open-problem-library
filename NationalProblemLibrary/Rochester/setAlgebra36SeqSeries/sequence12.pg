A Super Happy Fun Ball is dropped from a height of $A feet and rebounds 
\($C/$B\) of the distance from which it fell.
How many times will it bounce before its rebound is less than 1 foot?
$BR
It will bounce \{ans_rule(20) \} times before its rebound is less than 1 foot.
$BR
How far will the ball travel before it comes to rest on the ground?
$BR
It will travel \{ans_rule(20) \} feet before it comes to rest on the ground.
