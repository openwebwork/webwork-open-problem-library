BEGIN_TEXT
Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of \($a\) cubic feet per minute. 
It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter and height
are always the same.  How fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is
\($h\) feet high? Recall that the  volume of a right circular cone with height \(h\) 
and radius of the base \(r\) is given by \(V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h \).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
We are given that the diameter and height are always the same, so \(2r=h\) or 
\(r=\frac{h}{2}\). 
$BR $BR The equation \( V= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h \) can be rewritten as 
\( V= \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{h}{2} \right)^2h \) or \( V= \frac{1}{12}\pi h^3\). 
$BR $BR Differentiate both sides of the last equation with respect to time \((t)\): 
$BR $BR 
\(V' = \frac{1}{12}\pi 3 h^2 h'\)
$BR $BR 
\(V' = \frac{1}{12} \pi 3 h^2 h'\) 
$BR $BR 
If \(V'=$a\) and \(h=$h\), then 
$BR $BR 
\($a = \frac{1}{12} \pi (3) $h^2 h'\) 
$BR $BR 
\(\displaystyle h' = \frac{$a(12)}{(3)$h^2\pi}\)
