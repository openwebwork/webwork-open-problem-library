Solve the following two $LQ union $RQ type questions: $BR
(a) How many bit strings of length $length either begin with 
$beg 0s or end with $end 1s? (inclusive or)$BR
\{ ans_rule(30) \}
$PAR
(b) Every student in a discrete math class is either a computer science 
or a mathematics major or is a joint major in these two subjects. 
How many students are in the class if there are \( $a \) computer 
science majors (including joint majors), \( $b \) math majors (including
joint majors) and \( $c \) joint majors? $BR
