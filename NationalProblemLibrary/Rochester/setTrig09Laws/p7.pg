A ship is sailing due north. At a certain point the bearing of a lighthouse is
N \( $ang1 ^\circ \)E and the distance is $a. After a while, the captain notices
that the bearing of the lighthouse is now  S \( $ang2 ^\circ \)E.
How far did the ship travel between the two observations of the lighthouse.
