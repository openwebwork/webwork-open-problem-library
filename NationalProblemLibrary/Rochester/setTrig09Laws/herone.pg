A triangular parcel of land has sides of lengths $a feet, $b feet and $c feet.

$PAR
a) What is the area of the parcel of land?
$BR
Area = \{ans_rule(20)\}

b) If land is valued at $value per acre (1 acre is 43,560 feet\( ^2\) ),
what is the value of the parcel of land?

$BR     value = \{ans_rule(20)\}
