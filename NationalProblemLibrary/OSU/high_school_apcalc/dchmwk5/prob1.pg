TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
A particle moves along a straight line and its position at time \(t\)
is given by \( s(t)= 2t^3 - $d1 t^2 + $e1 t \) where s is measured in feet and
t in seconds.
$BR Find the velocity (in ft/sec) of the particle at the time when the acceleration is 0.
$BR
velocity = \{ans_rule(20) \}

The particle changes direction twice from positive to negative at time
