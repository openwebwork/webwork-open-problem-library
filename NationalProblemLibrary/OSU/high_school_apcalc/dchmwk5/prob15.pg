BEGIN_TEXT
Let \(y\) be defined implicitly by the equation
\[\ln($a y) = $b xy\]
$PAR
Use implicit differentiation to find the first derivative.
$BR
\(\frac{dy}{dx} =\) \{ans_rule(35)\}
$PAR

Use implicit differentiation to find the second derivative.
$BR
\(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} =\) \{ans_rule(55)\}
$BR
Note: Your answer should only involve the variables \(x\) and \(y\).
You should simplify your answer as much as possible before entering
it into WeBWorK.
