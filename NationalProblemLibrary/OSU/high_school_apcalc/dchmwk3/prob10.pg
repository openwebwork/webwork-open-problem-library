If \( f(x) = $a x + \frac{$b}{x} \), find \( f'( $x1 ) \), using the
definition of derivative. \( f'( $x1 ) \) is the limit as \(x\to\) \{ans_rule()\}
of the expression

The value of this limit is

Use this to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of
 \( y = $a  x + \frac{$b}{x} \)

The equation of this tangent line can be written in the form
$BR
