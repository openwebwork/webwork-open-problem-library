The altitude of a triangle is increasing at a rate of \(!{$altSpeed:%5.3f} \)
centimeters/minute while the area of the triangle is increasing at a rate
of \(!{$areaSpeed:%5.3f}\) square centimeters/minute.  At what rate is the base
of the triangle changing when the altitude is \(!{$alt:%5.3f}\) centimeters and
the area is \(!{$area:%5.3f}\) square centimeters?
