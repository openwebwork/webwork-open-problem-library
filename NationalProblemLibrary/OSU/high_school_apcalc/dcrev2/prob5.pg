BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that two boats leave a dock at different times. One heads due north,
the other due east.
Find the rate at which the distance between the boats is changing
when the first boat is $y miles 
from the dock traveling at a speed of $v miles per hour
and the second boat is $x
miles from the dock traveling at a speed of $u miles per hour. $BR
Answer: \{ans_rule(40)\}
