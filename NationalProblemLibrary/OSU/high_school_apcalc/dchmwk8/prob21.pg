BEGIN_TEXT
A printed poster is to have a total area of $c square inches with top and
bottom margins of $a inches and side margins of $b inches. What should be the
dimensions of the poster so that the printed area be as large as possible?
$PAR
To solve this problem let \(x\) denote the width of the poster and let \(y\)
denote the length. We need to maximize the following function of \(x\) and \(y\):
$BR
\{ans_rule(35)\}
$BR
We can reexpress this as the following function of \(x\) alone:
$BR
\(f(x) =\) \{ans_rule(45)\}
$BR
We find that \(f(x)\) has a critical number at \(x=\)\{ans_rule()\}
$BR
To verify that \(f(x)\) has a maximum at this critical number we compute
the second derivative \(f''(x)\) and find that its value at the critical
number is \{ans_rule()\}, a negative number.
$BR
Thus the optimal dimensions of the poster are \{ans_rule()\} inches in
width and \{ans_rule()\} inches in height giving us a maximumal printed
area of \{ans_rule()\} square inches.
