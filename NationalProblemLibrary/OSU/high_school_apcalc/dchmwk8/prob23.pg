BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of
\[f(x) = $m x + e^{$a\sin(x)}\]
is rotated counterclockwise about the origin through an acute angle \(\theta\).
What is the largest value of \(\theta\) for which the rotated graph is still
the graph of a function? What about if the graph is rotated clockwise?
$PAR
To answer this question we need to find the maximal slope of \(y=f(x)\), which
is \{ans_rule()\}, and the minimal slope which is \{ans_rule()\}.
$PAR
Thus the maximal acute angle through which the graph can be rotated counterclockwise
is \(\theta=\)\{ans_rule()\} degrees.
$PAR
Thus the maximal acute angle through which the graph can be rotated clockwise
is \(\theta=\)\{ans_rule()\} degrees. (Your answer should be negative to indicate
the clockwise direction.)
$PAR
Note that a line \(y = mx+b\) makes angle \(\alpha\) with the horizontal,
where \(\tan(\alpha) = m\).
$PAR
$BBOLD Hints: $EBOLD Recall that a graph of a function is characterized by the property that every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point. In view of this: $BR
1. If ALL lines \(y=mx+b\) of a fixed slope \(m\) intersect a graph of \(y=f(x)\) in at most one point, what can you say about rotating the graph of \(y=f(x)\)? $BR
2. If some line \(y=mx+b\) intersects the graph of \(y=f(x)\) in two or more points, what can you say about rotating the graph of \(y=f(x)\)? $BR
3. If some line \(y=mx+b\) intersects the graph of \(y=f(x)\) in two or more points, what does the Mean Value Theorem tell us about \(f'(x)\)?
