You are driving along a country road when you suddenly notice a log
in the road ahead of you and immediately apply your brakes. You travel
a distance of \(s(t) = $lin t - $c t^2\) feet in \(t\) seconds after you
hit the brakes.$PAR
The log was $const feet ahead of you when you noticed it, which unfortunately
wasn't soon enough.$PAR
At what time (in seconds) did you hit the log? \{ans_rule(20)\}$BR
How fast were you going (in ft/sec) when you hit it? \{ans_rule(20)\}
