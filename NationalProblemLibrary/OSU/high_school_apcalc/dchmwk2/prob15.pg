BEGIN_TEXT
It is given to you that an equation of the tangent line to the graph
of \(y=g(x)\) at \(x = $aa\) is
\[$coef1 x + $coef2 y = $c\]
It follows that \(y =\) \{ans_rule()\} is the equation of the tangent line
to \(y = g(x^2)\) at \(x = $a\) and that \(y =\) \{ans_rule()\} is the equation
of the tangent line to \(y = \left(g(x)\right)^2\) at \(x = $aa\).
