TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Fred takes out a loan from C'Ville Bank at a nominal rate of
$ip percent convertible monthly, and agrees to repay the loan with
36 equal monthly payments, the first due a month after the loan is made.
 Immediately after making the 13th payment, C'Ville sells the loan
 to Richmond Bank for $a dollars.  If Richmond Bank's yield on the loan is
 $jp percent convertible monthly, how much did Fred originally
 borrow?
