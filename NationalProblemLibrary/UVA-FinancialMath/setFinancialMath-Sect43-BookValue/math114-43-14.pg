A ${n}-year bond with a face value of 1000 dollars is redeemable at par, pays 
coupons at $ip percent per 6 months, and has a yield rate of $yp percent 
convertible semiannually. Suppose the book value immediately 
after the payment of the ${t}th coupon is equal to the price of a 
perpetuity (at the time of the ${t}th coupon) that will start making annual 
payments one year after the ${t}th coupon.
If the perpetuity earns interest at $kp percent effective,
how large is each perpetuity payment?
