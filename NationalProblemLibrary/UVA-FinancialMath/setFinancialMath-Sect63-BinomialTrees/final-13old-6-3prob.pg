TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));
Suppose that a stock price is currently \(S\) dollars, and you set up a riskless 
portfolio which consists of shorting 1 European call option and purchasing 
an appropriate number of shares of the stock.  Suppose it is known that six months from now, the price will be either
$ip percent higher, where the option will have a value of 2 dollars, or the stock price will be $ip percent lower, where the option will be worthless.  Find the value of the option now.  Assume the option expires in six months,  that no arbitrage opportunities exist, and a
risk-free interest rate of $rp percent.
