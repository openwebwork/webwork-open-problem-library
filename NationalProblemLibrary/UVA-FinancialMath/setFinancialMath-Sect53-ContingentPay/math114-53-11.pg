A loan of $n dollars is to be repaid with annual payments for $m years,
with the first coming a year from now.  There is a $dp percent chance that a
given payment won't be made, and once a payment is missed, no further
payments are made.  If the lender desires a yield of $yp percent effective, how much
should each of the annual payments be?
