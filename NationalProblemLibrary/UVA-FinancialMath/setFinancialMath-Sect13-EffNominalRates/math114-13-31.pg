Two accounts are opened at the same time.  You deposit $a dollars into the first 
account, which earns interest at an effective rate of $ip percent.  At the same time,
you deposit $b dollars into the second account, which earns an effective rate of 
$jp percent.  How long will it take for the balance in the first account to be exactly twice 
the balance in the second account?  (Assume compound interest at all times.)
