A share of preferred stock pays dividends at a predetermined rate,
and so can be thought of as a bond that pays coupons forever and has
no redemption value.  Suppose that such a share of stock pays
annual dividends that increase by $q dollars with each dividend,
and the first dividend is $p dollars.  If the price of the stock is
$pv dollars, and the first dividend comes one year after the 
stock is purchased, what is the yield rate?  
(Give your answer as an effective rate.)
