Barbara borrows $a dollars.  She agrees to make monthly interest payments on 
the loan, and will build up a sinking fund with monthly deposits to repay 
the principal with a single payment $n months 
from now. If the interest rate on the loan is
$ip percent, and the interest paid on the sinking fund is $jp percent, both
nominal convertible monthly, what is Barbara's total outlay?
