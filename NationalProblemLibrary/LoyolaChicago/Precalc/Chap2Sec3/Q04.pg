$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
Graph $ans is correct.
$BR $SPACE $BR
Over the interval \(  x \leq 0 \) the graph is a parabola which continues on to \( \infty \) as \( x \rightarrow - \infty \) and stops at the origin (technically a closed point at the origin.
$BR $SPACE $BR
Over the interval \( 0 < x < 4  \) the graph is \( y = \sqrt{x} \) which has open endpoints at the origin and at (4,2).  Notice the open endpoint at the origin overlaps the closed endpoint at the origin of the parabola.  Therefore the graph is uninterrupted at origin.
$BR $SPACE $BR
Over the interval \( x \geq 4  \) we have the line \( y = x/2 \) which has positive slope and includes the left endpoint (4,2).  Since the closed point of this piece at (4,2) overlaps exactly the open right endpoint of the previous piece, the graph has no hole or jump at \( x = 4 \).  There is no endpoint on the right.  As \( x \rightarrow + \infty \), the graph goes up.
