$PAR
$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) The population, \( P \), in millions, is given by \( P=$p($year_b)^t \), so a century later
\[ P = $p($year_b)^{100} \approx $year_r \mbox{ million people.} \]
$PAR
b) The population, \( P \), in millions, is given by \( P = $p e^{$dec t} \), so a century later 
\[ P = $p e^{$dec(100)} \approx $cont_r \mbox{ million people.} \]
