Question 30:
$BR $SPACE $BR
The sales tax on an item is $r${PERCENT}.  Express the total cost, $BITALIC C${EITALIC}, in terms of the price of the item, $BITALIC P${EITALIC}.  Be sure to use the correct case of the variable when entering your expression.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
If the sales tax is $r${PERCENT}, then if you purchase an item which has price $BITALIC P ${EITALIC}, the amount of tax you are charged for the item is \( P(0.0${r}) \) .  The total cost equals the cost of the item itself, which is \( P \) , plus the tax, which is \( P(0.0${r}) \).  Thus the total cost is
\[ C = P + P(0.0$r) = $b P \]
$BR
