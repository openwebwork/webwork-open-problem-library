$PAR
(a)
Since \(N\) is growing by $rpercent$PERCENT per year, we know that \(N\) is an
exponential function of \(t\) with growth factor \(1 + $r = $b\).
Since \(N = $a\) when \(t = 0\), we have
\[
N = $a($b)^t.
\]
$PAR
(b) In the year $endyear, we have \(t = $tb\) and
\[
N = $a($b)^{$tb} \approx $ansbr \hbox{ million passengers.}
\]
$PAR
(c)
In the year 2000, we have \(t = $tc\) and
\[
N = $a($b)^{$tc} \approx $anscr \hbox{ million passengers.}
\]
