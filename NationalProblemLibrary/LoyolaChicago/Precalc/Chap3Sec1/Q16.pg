$PAR

The formula \( f(t) = ab^t \) represents exponential growth if the base \( b > 1 \) and exponential decay if \( 0 < b < 1 \). Towns $q_grow are growing and towns $q_decay are shrinking.
$PAR
Town $q_fastest_grow  is growing the fastest since its growth factor of $fast_grow_fact is the largest.  Since $fast_grow_fact - 1 = $fast_grow_dec, it is growing at a rate of $fast_grow_rate${PERCENT}.  Town $q_fastest_decay is shrinking the fastest since its decay factor of $fast_decay_fact is the smallest.  Since 1 - $fast_decay_fact = $fast_decay_dec, it is shrinking at a rate of $fast_decay_rate${PERCENT}.
$PAR
In the exponential function \( f(t) = ab^t \), the parameter \(a\) gives the value of the function when \(t = 0\).  We see that town $large_pop has the largest initial population ($a[2]) and town $small_pop has the smallest initial population ($a[1]).
