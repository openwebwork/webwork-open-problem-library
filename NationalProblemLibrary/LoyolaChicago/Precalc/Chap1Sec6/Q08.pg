Question 8:
$BR $SPACE $BR
Until Barry Bonds broke the record in 2007, Henry Aaron held the record for the greatest number of home-runs hit in the major leagues. The table below shows his
cumulative yearly record over the course of his career from 1954-1973, where the independent variable denotes the time $BITALIC t $EITALIC in years since 1953 (${BITALIC}t${EITALIC}=1 corresponds to 1954), and the dependent variable $BITALIC H $EITALIC denotes Aaron's cumulative home run total.

a) Use a calculator or computer to find the least squares regression
line, \( H = mt + b \).  Enter the equation for the line below, rounding your values for $BITALIC m $EITALIC and $BITALIC b $EITALIC to 2 decimal places.
$BR

$BR $SPACE $BR
b) Based on your answer above, approximately how many home runs did Aaron average per season? (round to the nearest whole number) $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE\{ ans_rule(5) \} home runs per season.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) Based on your answer to (b), assuming Aaron continues to hit home runs at this pace, approximately how many total (cumulative) home runs do you think Henry Aaron hit in: $BR
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 1974? \{ ans_rule(8) \} home runs $BR 
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 1975? \{ ans_rule(8) \} home runs $BR 
$SPACE $SPACE $SPACE $SPACE 1976? \{ ans_rule(8) \} home runs 
$BR $SPACE $BR 
d) In actuality, Aaron had a total of 755 home runs when he retired in 1976.  On a separate piece of paper, explain why your answer for the total in 1976 in part (c) is not an accurate prediction.

$BBOLD  SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR 
a) Using linear regression we find that the linear function \( H =$rd_a + $rd_b t \) gives a correlation coefficient of \( r= $rd_r \).  Since the correlation coefficient is very close to 1, it means Aaron's home runs grew very closely to at constant rate.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) The slope gives the average number of home-runs per year, about $rd_rdb.
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) From the answer to part (b) we expect Henry Aaron to hit about $rd_rda. home-runs in each of the years 1974, 1975, and 1976.  Therefore based on our linear regression, we would predict that Aaron's homerun total in 1974 would be $y[19] + $rd_rdb = $out[0], his total in 1975 would be $out[0] + $rd_rdb = $out[1], and his home run total after 1976 (year of retirement) would be $out[1] + $rd_rdb = $out[2].
$BR $SPACE $BR
However, people seldom retire at the peak of their abilities, so it is likely that Aaron's performance dropped off in the last few years. In fact he scored 20 , 12, and 10 home-runs in the years 1974, 1975, and 1976, well below the average of $rd_rdb.
