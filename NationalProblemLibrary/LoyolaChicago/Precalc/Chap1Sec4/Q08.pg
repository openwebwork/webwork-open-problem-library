Question 8:
$BR $SPACE $BR
If possible write the following expression in $BBOLD slope-intercept $EBOLD form.
$BR
$BCENTER
\( x = $c \)
$ECENTER
$BR $SPACE $BR
a) What is the value of $BITALIC m $EITALIC when written in slope-intercept form?  If the equation cannot be written in slope-intercept form, enter NONE in the box.  $BITALIC m $EITALIC = \{ ans_rule(20) \}
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) What is the value of $BITALIC b $EITALIC when written in slope-intercept form?  If the equation cannot be written in slope-intercept form, enter NONE in the box.  $BITALIC b $EITALIC = \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
The equation \( x = $c \) $SPACE cannot be written in slope-intercept form.  This is a vertical line whose slope is undefined.
