BEGIN_TEXT

The population of a town in 1920 was $b people.
The town's population decreased linearly, and in $year the population was $c.
Find a formula for \(P\), the town's population, in terms of \(t\), the
number  of years since 1920.

\( P(t) = \ \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$PAR
The points ( 0, $b ) and ( $dt , $c ).  Using these points we have a slope
of \( m = \frac{ $c - $b }{$dt - 0} = -$m \).  The vertical intercept is the
population in 1920 (when \(t = 0\)), \(b = $b\).  The formula is therefore
\( P(t) = $b - $m t \).
