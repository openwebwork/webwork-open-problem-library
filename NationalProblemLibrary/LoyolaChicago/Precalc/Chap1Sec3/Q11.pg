Question 11:
$BR $SPACE $BR
The population of a town in 1920 was $b people.  The town's population decreased linearly, and in $year the population was $c .  Find a formula for $BITALIC P ${EITALIC}, the town's population, in terms of $BITALIC t ${EITALIC}, the number  of years since 1920.
$BR $SPACE $BR
\( P(t) = \ \) \{ ans_rule(25) \}

$BR
The points ( 0, $b ) and ( $dt , $c ).  Using these points we have a slope of $SPACE \( m = \frac{ $c - $b }{$dt - 0} = -$m \) .  The vertical intercept is the population in 1920 (when $BITALIC t $EITALIC = 0), $BITALIC b $EITALIC = $b .  The formula is therefore $SPACE \( P(t) = $b - $m t \) .
