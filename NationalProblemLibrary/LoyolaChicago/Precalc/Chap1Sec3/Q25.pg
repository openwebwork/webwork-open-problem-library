Question 25:
$BR $SPACE $BR
A report by the US Geological Survey indicates that glaciers in Glacier National Park, Montana, are shrinking.  Recent estimates indicate the area covered by glaciers has decreased from over $SPACE\( 25.5 \ \mbox{km}^2 \) $SPACE in 1850 to about $SPACE\( 25.5 \ \mbox{km}^2 \) $SPACE in 1995.  Let $BITALIC A = f(t) $EITALIC give the area (in square km) $BITALIC t $EITALIC years after 2000, and assume $SPACE \( f(t) = 16.2 - 0.062t \).

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$BR $SPACE $BR
$BBOLD SOLUTION $EBOLD
$BR
a) The slope is $BITALIC m $EITALIC = 0.062, which tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by \( 0.062 \ \mbox{km}^2 \) per year.  Since 1 km = 1,000 m, it follows that  \( 1 \ \mbox{km}^2 = 1,000,000 \ \mbox{m}^2 \).  Equivalently, the slope tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by \( 62,000 \ \mbox{m}^2 \) per year.
$BR $SPACE $BR
b) The $BITALIC A${EITALIC}-intercept is $BITALIC b $EITALIC = 16.2, which tells us that in the year 2000, the area was \( 16.2 \ \mbox{km}^2 \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
c) $BITALIC f( $q ) $EITALIC is the amount of area in the park covered by glaciers in 2012 ($q years after 2000).  $BITALIC f(t) = $q $EITALIC signifies how many years after 2000 will the area covered by glaciers be \( $q \ \mbox{km}^2 \).
$BR $SPACE $BR
d) We have \( f( $q ) = 16.2 - 0.062( $q) = $ans_d \)
$BR $SPACE $BR
e) \( m = \frac{ \triangle A }{ \triangle t } = -0.062 \) $SPACE .  Letting \( \triangle t = $q \) $SPACE we have \( \frac{ \triangle A }{ $q } = -0.062 \) $SPACE , and therefore \( \triangle A = - $ans_e \).  So about $ans_e acres disappear in $q years.
$BR $SPACE $BR
f) We have \( 16.2 - 0.062 t = $q \) $SPACE , so that \( - 0.062 t = $diff \) $SPACE , and finally  \(t \approx $approx \).
