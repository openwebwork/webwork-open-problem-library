BEGIN_TEXT
Show that \[ f(x) = $f \] has a removable discontinuity at \(x=0\) by
$PAR
(a) verifying (1) in the definition above, and then
$PAR
(b) verifying (2) in the definition above by determining a value of \(f(0)\) that would make \(f\) continuous
at \(x=0\).
$PAR
\(f(0)=\)\{ans_rule(15)\} would make \(f\) continuous at \(x=0\).
$PAR
${BBOLD}Hint:$EBOLD Try combining the fractions and simplifying.
$PAR
The discontinuity at \( x=$a \) is actually ${BBOLD}not$EBOLD a removable
discontinuity, just in case you were wondering.
